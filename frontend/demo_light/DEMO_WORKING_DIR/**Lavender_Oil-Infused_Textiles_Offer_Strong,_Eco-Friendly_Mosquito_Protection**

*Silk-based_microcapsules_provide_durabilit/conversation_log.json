This not only makes lavender oil-infused textiles more effective, but also more sustainable as they do not need to be constantly reapplied.\n\nIn addition, lavender oil has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for its medicinal properties (source [2]). This long history of use suggests that it is a safe and natural option for mosquito repellency.\n\nMoreover, according to a guide on using lavender oil to repel mosquitoes, it can also provide a pleasant and relaxing environment when diffused in the home (source [3]). This makes it a great option for those looking to create a peaceful and insect-free space.\n\nIn conclusion, the properties of lavender oil, including its scent, mosquito-repellent properties, and long history of safe use, make it an ideal ingredient for use in mosquito-repellent textiles. Its incorporation into silk-based microcapsules not only provides durability and long-lasting effectiveness, but also offers an eco-friendly alternative to traditional repellents.", "user_utterance": "Are there specific properties of lavender oil that make it more effective for use in mosquito-repellent textiles compared to other essential oils?", "search_queries": ["What are the benefits of using lavender oil in mosquitorepellent textiles?", "How does lavender oil work as a repellent for mosquitoes?", "What makes lavender oil more effective for use in textiles compared to other essential oils?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7248/2/1/3", "description": "Lavender and Cedarwood were found to be an effective remedy for stress in the first study that had subjects smell fabric specimens containing the essential oils as compared to a control fabric during an experimental protocol that involved inducing stress on the subjects .

(Syn: L. officinalis L. vera DC.)\nFamily: Lamiaceae (Labiatae)\nAncient Cultivation and Cultural Significance\nThe earliest recorded uses of lavender date back over 2,500 years to ancient Persia, Greece, and Rome. Lavender preparations were used to disinfect sick rooms and hospitals. The ancient Greeks referred to the plant as nardus or nard after the Syrian city Naarda. Lavender was highly prized by the Roman aristocracy, with blossoms selling for 100 denarii per pound in the 1st century CE.\nThe Romans used lavender for its medicinal properties and pleasant scent. However, the most commonly cultivated species today, Lavandula angustifolia, was likely unknown to the Romans. Lavender\u2019s genus name Lavandula probably derives from the Latin word livere meaning bluish or livid, referring to the plant\u2019s blue-violet flowers.", "Multiple randomized trials have shown lavender aromatherapy can significantly reduce patients\u2019 anxiety levels preoperatively. A few studies also noted less postoperative anxiety. This may promote better surgical experiences and recoveries.\nEnhancing well-being in pregnancy & childbirth\nStudies of lavender aromatherapy during pregnancy, cesarean sections, and labor found reduced anxiety, improved sleep quality, and enhanced well-being. Lavender appears a safe, effective way to minimize anxiety and stress during the perinatal period.\nRelieving student test-taking anxiety\nSeveral studies demonstrated Lavender aromatherapy helped decrease testing anxiety among middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. It may serve as a practical stress management tool.\nManaging Anxiety in Dementia", "In ancient India and Tibet, lavender was incorporated into traditional Ayurvedic and Tibetan medical texts as early as the 8th century BCE. The Gyu-zhi, translated into Tibetan during this time, describes lavender as an ingredient in edible medicinal ointments used to treat psychosis and neurological disorders. Lavender continues to be used in Tibetan Buddhist medicine today.\nMedieval to Modern Medicinal Uses\nLavender gained recognition in modern Europe as a versatile medicinal herb. The flowers and essential oil are approved by the German Commission E for use in treating restlessness, insomnia, stomach irritations, and circulatory disorders. The German Standard License approves internal use of lavender teas and extracts for restlessness, sleep disorders, nervous intestinal discomfort, and functional abdominal problems.\nResearch on Lavender Essential Oil", "- Interacting with serotonin receptors \u2013 Lavender essential oil appears to reduce 5-HT1A receptor activity in brain areas involved in mood and emotion regulation like the cingulate cortex and hippocampus. This may mimic the effects of SSRIs and other antidepressant/anti-anxiety medications.\n- Enhancing parasympathetic activity \u2013 The parasympathetic nervous system controls the body\u2019s \u201crest and digest\u201d functions. Some studies of lavender inhalation have noted increased parasympathetic activity markers like heart rate variability, indicating relaxation of the autonomic nervous system.\n- Brain Waves \u2013 Changes in brain wave patterns and EEG readings indicating increased theta waves and drowsiness have been noted in studies of lavender aromatherapy, which could relate to relaxation effects.\nImplications of the Research\nGiven the overall evidence for modest anxiety-reducing effects, the use of lavender essential oil shows promise for these potential benefits:", "A recent comprehensive review published in Phytomedicine sought to analyze all of the available scientific evidence on the effects of lavender essential oil on anxiety. The results provide an insightful look at how lavender may work to reduce anxiety levels and point to some promising applications of this aromatic oil.\nThe authors conducted an extensive literature search for clinical trials investigating the effects of lavender essential oil on anxiety in human subjects. They ultimately analyzed 90 studies \u2013 65 randomized controlled trials (the gold standard in research) involving almost 8000 participants, and 25 non-randomized trials with 1200 participants.", "Preliminary evidence indicates lavender aromatherapy may alleviate agitation, restlessness and anxiety symptoms in older adults with dementia. It appeared well-tolerated and could provide an alternative to anti-anxiety medications in this population.\nLavender for Anxiety\nOverall, this comprehensive review indicates lavender aromatherapy has significant potential as a non-pharmacologic approach for managing different anxiety states. Though more research is still needed, lavender essential oil appears reasonably safe and shows promise as an inexpensive, accessible option for relieving anxiety. The pleasant aroma makes it easy and enjoyable to integrate into daily life.\nReference\nDonelli, D., Antonelli, M., Bellinazzi, C., Gensini, G. F., & Firenzuoli, F. (2019).

Although more research is needed, some potential mechanisms include:", "- Increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) \u2013 GABA is the brain\u2019s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Many anti-anxiety medications like benzodiazepines work by increasing GABA activity, which has a calming effect. Animal and lab studies indicate lavender may increase GABA levels in the amygdala, a brain region involved in regulating emotions like fear and anxiety.\n- Modulating glutamate \u2013 Glutamate is the brain\u2019s main excitatory neurotransmitter and in excess can induce \u201cexcitotoxicity\u201d damaging nerve cells. Lavender compounds like linalool may reduce glutamate activity. This calming action on \u201coverexcited\u201d nerve cells may underlie lavender\u2019s anti-anxiety effects.\n- Inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels \u2013 These channels play a key role in neurotransmitter release when activated. Lavender essential oil has been shown to inhibit the opening of these channels in lab experiments, which may prevent excessive nerve cell excitation that can lead to anxiety states.", "The lavender preparations used included inhalation of the essential oil, oral doses (like Silexan capsules containing lavender oil), massage with lavender oil, and aromatherapy diffusion. The studies measured anxiety using psychological questionnaires like the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and also looked at physiological measures like blood pressure and heart rate.\nKey Findings:\n- 54 out of 65 randomized trials found that lavender led to a significant improvement in at least one anxiety measure compared to control groups.\n- 44 trials showed a significant difference in anxiety levels between lavender and control groups after the intervention.\n- Oral doses of a standardized lavender essential oil product (Silexan at 80 mg/day) significantly reduced anxiety compared to placebo over extended treatment periods (at least 6-8 weeks) in multiple randomized trials.", "Complementary treatment for anxiety disorders\nThe data suggests oral lavender supplements like Silexan may help reduce excessive anxiety as part of an integrative approach, in conjunction with psychotherapy and conventional medications as needed.\nAromatherapy for situational anxiety\nInhaling lavender essential oil seems particularly helpful for alleviating anxious feelings in stressful situations like before surgery, during medical procedures, or in high-anxiety healthcare settings. It may provide a simple way for patients to self-manage anxiety.\nReducing anxiety associated with procedures\nSeveral studies found lavender aromatherapy reduced needle-related pain and anxiety during IV, venous catheter, and blood draw procedures.

This technology has been developed by incorporating natural compounds, such as lavender oil, into silk-based microcapsules, which provide long-lasting durability and retain repellent properties even after 40 washes [1]. This breakthrough offers a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional mosquito repellents like DEET and permethrin, which have raised health concerns [2].\n\nThe use of lavender oil in textiles as a mosquito repellent is not a new concept, as it has been used for centuries for its insect-repelling properties [3]. However, the incorporation of lavender oil into silk-based microcapsules has revolutionized the approach, making it more effective and long-lasting. These microcapsules are able to release the lavender oil gradually, providing continuous protection against mosquitoes.\n\nFurthermore, this technology not only benefits public health by protecting against mosquito-borne diseases, but it also minimizes environmental impact. The use of natural compounds and silk protein as carriers for the lavender oil offers a sustainable solution for mosquito protection [1]. Additionally, the use of lavender oil-infused textiles in everyday consumer items, such as clothing and bedding, makes it a convenient and accessible option for individuals.\n\nIt is important to note that lavender oil-infused textiles have been tested and proven to be effective in repelling mosquitoes. Studies have shown that the microcapsules provide long-lasting protection even after multiple washes [1]. This technology has also been incorporated into consumer products, such as insect repellent clothing and bedding, making it readily available for purchase [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the technology for lavender oil-infused textiles has been commercialized and is readily available for consumers. This innovative approach not only offers a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional mosquito repellents, but it also signifies the intersection of biotechnology and traditional plant-based solutions.", "user_utterance": "Has the technology for lavender oil-infused textiles been commercialized, or is it still in the research and development stage?", "search_queries": ["Lavender oilinfused textiles", "Mosquito protection using lavender oil", "Silkbased microcapsules for mosquito repellent"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7248/2/1/3", "description": "For instance, lemon oil infused textiles provided psychological and sensorial comfort, while patchouli oil, Artemsia argyi oil and moxa oil, ...

Conclusions\n- Studies in the area of aromatherapy are generally using the traditional application of essential oils via massage therapy to understand the therapeutic benefit of EOs. Upon topical application, EOs release their aroma with a burst, which quickly dissipates. There is no focus on optimizing the dosage, control of the EO release rate or the delivery mechanism. These studies are vexed with several issues and the results are rarely reproducible, which poses questions on their scientific worth.", "- On the other hand, studies which focused on achieving the controlled release, EO concentration optimization, and delivery mechanism such as micro/nanoencapsulation for controlled release of aroma are focused truly on the encapsulation mechanism and not on assessing the \u201ctherapeutic\u201d benefit of such aromatherapeutic textiles.\nFunding\nInstitutional Review Board Statement\nInformed Consent Statement\nData Availability Statement\nConflicts of Interest\nReferences\n- Ghayempour, S.; Montazer, M.

In order to make this oil more durable and effective for use in textiles, it can be encapsulated with silk protein. This process involves micro-encapsulation, which is a technique that creates tiny particles (microcapsules) containing the active ingredient (lavender oil) within a protective shell (silk protein). This technology was recently optimized through a study published in the Journal of Microencapsulation [1], which found that spray drying was the most efficient method for microencapsulation of lavender oil. This process involves drying the lavender oil and silk protein mixture into tiny droplets, which then form microcapsules when they come into contact with air. The resulting microcapsules can then be applied to textiles, providing long-lasting mosquito protection even after 40 washes [1].\n\nAnother study published in the journal Molecules [2] explored the use of complex coacervation, a technique that involves the formation of a polymer complex, to microencapsulate lavender oil. This study found that this method was effective in encapsulating the oil obtained through steam distillation at a semi-industrial scale [2]. The researchers also used freeze drying, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, and UV-VIS spectroscopy to analyze the encapsulation process and the resulting microcapsules [2]. They found that the microcapsules had a spherical shape and a smooth surface, and that they had a high encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity [2].\n\nIn summary, the micro-encapsulation of lavender oil with silk protein involves drying the mixture into tiny droplets using spray drying or complex coacervation, which then form into microcapsules.

The advantages of these plant-derived repellents are their pleasant fragrance, and nice feeling on the skin and vapor action, but only if we can coax these natural compounds to last as long as today\u2019s commercial products. While DEET is an effective contact repellent, many people dislike the oily feel and smell on their skin, and sometimes skin irritations occur. One consequence is that military personnel are less inclined to comply with using DEET on the skin because it is unpleasant to use. This raises their risk of them contracting mosquito-borne diseases. Consumers are always interested in alternatives to DEET and other synthetic repellents, so there are numerous natural repellents on the market.", "Why Plant-Based Mosquito Repellents Are So Hard to Make\nBug sprays with DEET feel oily and smell gross.

We began by following up folklore regarding catnip oil, from the catmint plant, and Osage orange (hedge apple) as repellents for insects and spiders. First we proved that they could repel these insects, and later we identified the individual chemicals, called terpenes, in their oils that are responsible for their repellent action. These discoveries earned us three patents on those natural terpenes as repellents, and the rights were licensed to a California company.", "My laboratory currently has a three-year grant from the Department of Defense\u2019s Deployed War Fighter Protection Program to take the research and testing to the next level, beyond the laboratory. Our compounds are being tested by a commercial partner to explore whether spatial repellents can provide days or weeks of protection in a building or outdoor area.\nThey plan to test the best candidate formulations against mosquitoes in field tests in Tanzania first, and then other countries in the tropics.", "The new derivatives are being termed \u201cbiorational\u201d because they were designed from and made from the natural terpenes in plant essential oils. They maintain many of the advantages of the natural repellents: They are fully biodegradable, with no ecotoxicology concerns or environmental residues, and generally considered safe like the thousands of types of plant essential oils used in the flavor and fragrance industries. However, thorough toxicology testing will need to be conducted to determine if they are truly non-toxic.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.\nJoel Coats, Distinguished Professor of Entomology, Iowa State University", "Since those earlier studies, my research group has focused on making derivatives of the best natural repellents in a quest to boost the repellent potency of the terpene that lasts up to eight hours in the laboratory. Three of my Ph.D. students \u2013 James Klimavicz, Caleb Corona and Edmund Norris \u2013 have contributed greatly to this project by designing, synthesizing, purifying, characterizing and testing more than 300 closely related chemicals derived from the best of the natural repellents like citronellol, menthol and thymol.\nThese students have successfully tested these derivatives against three species of mosquitoes: the yellow fever/Zika virus mosquito Aedes aegypti, the northern house mosquito which transmits West Nile virus, Culex pipiens, and the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. In addition, they have evaluated the potency of the best ones against dog ticks and the deer tick, which transmits Lyme disease, and also house flies.", "One group of the new repellents act through the air, much like citronella oil in yellow candles. These chemicals have a vapor action that provides protection, and they are called \u201cspatial\u201d repellents, since they act through space. These are potentially most useful in backyards, parks, houses, barracks and horse barns. Another group of the new compounds are the classic \u201ccontact\u201d repellents that repel insects from standing on a treated surface, such as human skin, clothing or tents; collaborators at the USDA-ARS in Gainesville, Florida, and BioGents in Regensburg, Germany, have conducted testing with humans to confirm the effectiveness and identify the very best ones.", "The strongest natural repellents were fast-acting but did not last very long. A few from the Osage orange had longer-lasting activity, but they were expensive to isolate from the fruit or synthesize in the lab. Many other plant essential oils, the \u201cessence\u201d of the plant, have been explored as insect repellents by our and many other laboratories, but virtually all of those natural repellents were too short-lived, providing protection from insects for little more than one or two hours.

When temporary isolation and rapid, targeted release of active components from the core is envisaged, microcapsules with impermeable shells burst open by mechanical pressure, abrasion, melting or thermal decomposition. Until release, the active components in the microcapsule core remain separated from the reactive components (leuco dyes and colour developers), converted from a liquid to a solid state and protected against evaporation (essential oils) or protected against environmental influences and oxidation (essential oils, lipids and vitamins).\n- Long-lasting, gradual release by diffusion through the permeable microcapsule shell. This principle is used in long-lasting perfumed textiles, in insect repellent fabrics and in sustained-release medical and cosmetic textiles.\n5.

This technique involves using silk protein, which is extracted from silkworm cocoons, to create microscopic capsules that are then infused with the essential oils. This process does not affect the quality or efficacy of the lavender oil, as the silk protein acts as a protective barrier for the oil, allowing it to retain its repellent properties even after multiple washes.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, the use of silk-based microcapsules provides durability to the textiles, as they can withstand up to 40 washes without losing their repellent properties. This is significantly more than traditional repellents like DEET and permethrin, which can lose their effectiveness after just a few washes.\n\nFurthermore, this innovative approach offers a sustainable alternative to traditional mosquito repellents, which often come with health concerns. Silk protein is a natural, biodegradable material, making it an environmentally-friendly option for mosquito protection. This also aligns with the growing trend of biotechnology and plant-based solutions in the consumer product market.\n\nAdditionally, silk protein has been gaining attention in the beauty industry for its numerous benefits for skin and hair. According to a blog by Silk Therapeutics, silk protein is often referred to as the \"elixir of youth\" due to its ability to improve skin hydration, sensitivity, and texture. This further supports the idea that silk-based microcapsules not only offer mosquito protection, but also have added benefits for the wearer.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of silk-based microcapsules to create lavender oil-infused textiles is a groundbreaking technology that offers strong, eco-friendly mosquito protection without compromising the quality or efficacy of the essential oil.", "user_utterance": "What specific microencapsulation technique is used to combine the lavender oil with silk protein, and does this process affect the quality or efficacy of the lavender oil?", "search_queries": ["What is microencapsulation and how is it used in textile production?", "How is silk protein used in textile production?", "What is the process of combining lavender oil with silk protein?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://northshorecrafts.com/how-is-silk-made-into-fabric-step-by-step/", "description": "Soaking the raw silk in warm water.

This crucial step sets the foundation for the entire weaving process. Did you know that some high-end silk fabrics can require up to 6,000 individual threads to be carefully arranged on the loom?\n\ud83d\ude2e That\u2019s a lot of patience and precision!\nThe warping process involves stretching the lengthwise threads (called the warp) onto the loom. These threads are then threaded through heddles and reed, which control the raising and lowering of threads during weaving.", "The hot air method is preferred in many industrial settings as it\u2019s efficient and produces high-quality silk. Cocoons are exposed to temperatures between 110-120\u00b0C for about 20-30 minutes. This process not only kills the pupa but also reduces the moisture content of the cocoons to about 6-7%, which is ideal for storage and further processing.\n2.3 Sorting and Grading Cocoons\nNow comes the part where we separate the silk superstars from the B-list cocoons! \ud83c\udf1f Sorting and grading is a crucial step that determines the quality and value of the final silk product. Cocoons are evaluated based on several factors:\nFun fact: Did you know that it takes about 2,500 silkworms to produce just one pound of raw silk? That\u2019s a lot of tiny workers for your fancy scarf! \ud83e\udde3\n2.4 Storing and Preparing Cocoons for Reeling", "The final step before the actual silk extraction begins is proper storage and preparation. Cocoons must be stored in a cool, dry place with good ventilation to prevent mold growth and maintain silk quality. The International Sericultural Commission recommends storing cocoons at a temperature of 25\u00b0C and relative humidity of 70% for optimal results.\nBefore reeling (the process of unwinding the silk filament), cocoons are typically sorted once more and then softened by immersing them in warm water. This helps to loosen the sericin, the gummy substance that holds the silk fibers together, making it easier to unwind the delicate threads without breaking them.\nAnd there you have it, folks! The journey from tiny silkworm to harvested cocoon is complete. Next stop: transforming these little silk capsules into the smooth, shimmering fabric we all know and love. It\u2019s a process that\u2019s been refined over thousands of years, and it\u2019s still as magical as ever.", "The silk-making process is a testament to the delicate balance between preserving traditional techniques and embracing modern innovations. Each step, from nurturing silkworms to the final touches on woven fabric, requires skill, patience, and a deep understanding of both the material and the craft.\nThis complex journey results in a fabric that is not only beautiful but also biodegradable, sustainable, and incredibly strong for its weight.\nAs consumers, understanding the intricate process behind silk production can foster a greater appreciation for this remarkable fabric. It highlights the value of silk not just as a luxury item, but as a product of meticulous craftsmanship and natural wonder.\nWhether used in high fashion, home decor, or even medical applications, silk continues to captivate and inspire, proving that its allure is as timeless as the process that creates it.", "Once the end is found, reelers use specialized machines to gently unwind the filament. Did you know that a single cocoon can produce up to 1,000 meters of silk thread? That\u2019s longer than 10 football fields!\n\ud83c\udfc8 The unwound filaments from multiple cocoons are then combined to create a single, stronger thread.\n3.2 Degumming: Removing Sericin from Raw Silk\nAfter reeling, the raw silk still contains sericin, which gives it a stiff and dull appearance. Degumming is the process of removing this sericin to reveal the soft, lustrous silk we all adore. It\u2019s like giving the silk a spa treatment! \ud83d\udc86\u2640\ufe0f\nThe degumming process typically involves:\n- Soaking the raw silk in warm water\n- Treating it with soap and alkaline solutions\n- Rinsing thoroughly to remove all traces of sericin", "Timing is everything when it comes to harvesting silk cocoons. Sericulturists (that\u2019s a fancy word for silk farmers \ud83d\ude09) typically wait 7-8 days after the silkworms have begun spinning their cocoons. This ensures that the cocoons are fully formed but prevents the moths from emerging and damaging the continuous silk filament.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the ideal harvesting time is when about 90% of the cocoons have a firm and compact feel.\n2.2 Stifling: Halting the Metamorphosis Process\nOnce harvested, it\u2019s time for a process that might sound a bit cruel, but it\u2019s essential for silk production \u2013 stifling. This step involves halting the metamorphosis process to prevent the moth from emerging and breaking the continuous silk filament. There are several methods for stifling:\n- Sun-drying (traditional method)\n- Hot air drying (most common in modern facilities)\n- Steam stifling\n- Electrical stifling", "3.4 Dyeing: Adding Color to Silk Fibers\nThe final step in preparing silk fibers is dyeing, which adds vibrant colors to the lustrous material. Silk\u2019s protein structure allows it to absorb dyes exceptionally well, resulting in rich, long-lasting colors. It\u2019s like painting on nature\u2019s finest canvas! \ud83c\udfa8\nSilk can be dyed at various stages of production:\n- Yarn dyeing: Coloring twisted silk threads\n- Piece dyeing: Dyeing woven or knitted silk fabrics\n- Printing: Applying patterns or designs to silk fabrics\nModern silk dyeing techniques often use eco-friendly dyes and processes. For instance, the International Journal of Engineering & Technology reports on sustainable silk dyeing methods using natural dyes derived from plants and insects.\nThese environmentally conscious approaches are becoming increasingly popular in the textile industry. Go green, silk! \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc4d\nWeaving Silk into Fabric", "From Silkworm To Fabric: A Comprehensive Guide On How Silk Is Made\nImagine running your fingers across a smooth, lustrous fabric that feels like liquid gold.

The process must be carefully controlled to avoid damaging the delicate silk fibroin proteins.\n3.3 Throwing: Twisting and Plying Silk Threads\nThrowing is the silk industry\u2019s term for twisting and plying silk threads to create stronger, more versatile yarns. This process is crucial for enhancing the strength and texture of silk fabrics. It\u2019s like giving the silk a workout to build its muscles! \ud83d\udcaa\nThe throwing process involves several steps:\n- Winding: Transferring silk from skeins to bobbins\n- Cleaning: Removing any remaining impurities\n- Twisting: Spinning individual fibers to increase strength\n- Doubling: Combining multiple twisted threads\n- Retwisting: Twisting the doubled threads together\nFun fact: The term \u201cthrowing\u201d comes from the Anglo-Saxon word \u201cthrawan,\u201d which means to twist or turn. Who knew silk-making had such linguistic roots? \ud83e\udd13", "Here\u2019s where things get really exciting! \ud83c\udfa8 Weavers can create intricate patterns and textures by manipulating the weaving process. This can involve using different colored threads, varying the weave structure, or even incorporating additional materials.\nOne particularly stunning technique is jacquard weaving, which uses a special loom to create complex patterns. The Jacquard loom, invented in 1804, was actually a precursor to modern computers \u2013 how\u2019s that for a silk-tech connection? \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\nFor more information on silk weaving techniques and their historical significance, check out the Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s article on the silk industry.\n4.4 Finishing Touches: Treatments and Enhancements\nLast but not least, the woven silk fabric often undergoes various finishing treatments to enhance its appearance and properties. These can include:\n- Degumming: Removing any remaining sericin (silk gum) for a softer feel.\n- Dyeing: Adding vibrant colors to the fabric.", "The silkworm then performs an intricate dance, moving its head in a figure-eight pattern to create the cocoon. This process takes about 3-4 days, during which the silkworm will decrease in size by about 25%.

These little guys have been cultivated for thousands of years, with their origins tracing back to China. Fun fact: Bombyx mori is Latin for \u201csilkworm of the mulberry tree\u201d \u2013 talk about a fitting name! \ud83d\ude0a\nWhile there are over 500 species of silkworms, the Bombyx mori is the primary species used in commercial silk production. These caterpillars have been selectively bred for so long that they can\u2019t survive in the wild anymore. Talk about being pampered! \ud83d\udc51\n1.2 From Egg to Larva: The Early Stages", "The silkworm\u2019s journey begins as a tiny egg, no bigger than a pinhead. A single female moth can lay up to 500 eggs in her short lifespan of 4-6 days. That\u2019s quite a legacy! \ud83e\udd5a\ud83e\udd5a\ud83e\udd5a\nAfter about 10-14 days, these eggs hatch into adorable little larvae, also known as caterpillars.

It\u2019s like they\u2019re preparing for an all-you-can-eat buffet! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n1.3 The Feeding Phase: Mulberry Leaves and Growth\nNow comes the fun part \u2013 eating! Silkworms feed exclusively on mulberry leaves, munching their way through about 50,000 times their initial weight. Talk about a growth spurt! \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\udcaa\nThis feeding frenzy lasts for about 35 days, during which the silkworm will molt four times. Each molt is called an \u201cinstar,\u201d and by the end of the fifth instar, our little friend has grown to about 3 inches long. That\u2019s a 10,000-fold increase in size! \ud83d\ude2e", "Don\u2019t you just love how nature and human ingenuity come together to create something so beautiful? \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf89\nExtracting and Preparing Silk Fibers\nThe journey from silkworm cocoon to luxurious fabric is a fascinating process that involves several intricate steps.

They can convert 25-30% of the protein in mulberry leaves into silk protein. Now that\u2019s what we call eco-friendly production! \ud83c\udf0d\n1.4 Cocoon Formation: The Silk-Spinning Process\nAfter their feeding frenzy, silkworms enter the most crucial stage \u2013 cocoon spinning. They produce a single continuous silk filament that can be up to 1,000 meters long. Imagine wrapping yourself in a blanket that long! \ud83d\udecc\nThe silkworm uses its specially modified salivary glands to produce a liquid silk protein called fibroin. As this liquid is pushed through the silkworm\u2019s spinneret (a special organ for silk production), it\u2019s coated with sericin, a gummy substance that helps the silk filament maintain its shape."], "title": "From Silkworm To Fabric: A Comprehensive Guide On How Silk Is Made"}, {"url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/110208/Buehler_Silk.pdf", "description": "Silk Properties and Production Silk, with its remarkable structure and versatility, has emerged as a particularly exciting ...

Motivation and Research Questions\n2. Publication Trends in Microencapsulation for Textiles\n3. Microcapsules in Functional Textile Products\n4. Purposes and Effects of Microencapsulation in Functional Textiles\n- Permanent protection or separation of a core material for the life of the product. Such long-life microcapsules provide localized activity by permanently confining the liquid core within the mechanically resistant shell, as in PCMs for active thermal regulation or colour-changing textiles with electrochromic, photochromic and thermochromic materials.", "- Targeted release of the core under planned conditions that trigger the opening of the shell. When temporary isolation and rapid, targeted release of active components from the core is envisaged, microcapsules with impermeable shells burst open by mechanical pressure, abrasion, melting or thermal decomposition. Until release, the active components in the microcapsule core remain separated from the reactive components (leuco dyes and colour developers), converted from a liquid to a solid state and protected against evaporation (essential oils) or protected against environmental influences and oxidation (essential oils, lipids and vitamins).\n- Long-lasting, gradual release by diffusion through the permeable microcapsule shell. This principle is used in long-lasting perfumed textiles, in insect repellent fabrics and in sustained-release medical and cosmetic textiles.\n5.

Selection of Literature\n- The study must have well-directed goals/objectives.\n- Therapeutic effects of the fragrances were tested using a suitable experimental methodology.\n- The study had a sample representative of sufficient subject population OR the sample studies were selected from credible database sources for review papers.\n- Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.\n- The study was published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n3.

Biocidal Applications\n4.3. Therapeutic Applications\n5. Conclusions\n- Studies in the area of aromatherapy are generally using the traditional application of essential oils via massage therapy to understand the therapeutic benefit of EOs. Upon topical application, EOs release their aroma with a burst, which quickly dissipates. There is no focus on optimizing the dosage, control of the EO release rate or the delivery mechanism. These studies are vexed with several issues and the results are rarely reproducible, which poses questions on their scientific worth.", "- On the other hand, studies which focused on achieving the controlled release, EO concentration optimization, and delivery mechanism such as micro/nanoencapsulation for controlled release of aroma are focused truly on the encapsulation mechanism and not on assessing the \u201ctherapeutic\u201d benefit of such aromatherapeutic textiles.\nFunding\nInstitutional Review Board Statement\nInformed Consent Statement\nData Availability Statement\nConflicts of Interest\nReferences\n- Ghayempour, S.; Montazer, M.
