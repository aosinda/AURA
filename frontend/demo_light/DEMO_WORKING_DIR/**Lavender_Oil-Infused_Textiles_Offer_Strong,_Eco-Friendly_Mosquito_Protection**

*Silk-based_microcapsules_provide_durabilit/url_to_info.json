However, thorough toxicology testing will need to be conducted to determine if they are truly non-toxic.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.\nJoel Coats, Distinguished Professor of Entomology, Iowa State University", "Since those earlier studies, my research group has focused on making derivatives of the best natural repellents in a quest to boost the repellent potency of the terpene that lasts up to eight hours in the laboratory. Three of my Ph.D. students \u2013 James Klimavicz, Caleb Corona and Edmund Norris \u2013 have contributed greatly to this project by designing, synthesizing, purifying, characterizing and testing more than 300 closely related chemicals derived from the best of the natural repellents like citronellol, menthol and thymol.\nThese students have successfully tested these derivatives against three species of mosquitoes: the yellow fever/Zika virus mosquito Aedes aegypti, the northern house mosquito which transmits West Nile virus, Culex pipiens, and the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. In addition, they have evaluated the potency of the best ones against dog ticks and the deer tick, which transmits Lyme disease, and also house flies.", "Even though DEET remains the most commonly used, and most powerful, mosquito repellent ever developed, scientists are actively pursuing effective products based entirely on plant oils, some tracing their roots to traditional remedies. The advantages of these plant-derived repellents are their pleasant fragrance, and nice feeling on the skin and vapor action, but only if we can coax these natural compounds to last as long as today\u2019s commercial products. While DEET is an effective contact repellent, many people dislike the oily feel and smell on their skin, and sometimes skin irritations occur. One consequence is that military personnel are less inclined to comply with using DEET on the skin because it is unpleasant to use. This raises their risk of them contracting mosquito-borne diseases. Consumers are always interested in alternatives to DEET and other synthetic repellents, so there are numerous natural repellents on the market.", "My laboratory currently has a three-year grant from the Department of Defense\u2019s Deployed War Fighter Protection Program to take the research and testing to the next level, beyond the laboratory. Our compounds are being tested by a commercial partner to explore whether spatial repellents can provide days or weeks of protection in a building or outdoor area.\nThey plan to test the best candidate formulations against mosquitoes in field tests in Tanzania first, and then other countries in the tropics."], "title": "Why Plant-Based Mosquito Repellents Are So Hard to Make"}, "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/11/11/1371": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/11/11/1371", "description": "The review provides an overview of research findings on microencapsulation for functional textile coatings.
