Notably, SES differences in cognitive abilities are already observable when children start school, and tend not to narrow with age (e.g., Hackman et al., 2015), and may even widen. For example, von Stumm and Plomin (2015) reported that in a large sample of almost 15,000 UK children followed from infancy through adolescence, children from low SES families scored on average 6 IQ points lower at age 2 than children from high SES backgrounds but by age 16, this difference had almost tripled.

Increasing heritability rates could therefore be a useful indicator of reducing educational inequality.", "With respect to genetics, work in behaviour genetics has begun to impact on education. Most obviously, evidence points to the heritability of differences in educational achievement. Heritability is defined as the amount of variation in behaviour explained by genetic similarity. Heritability is either inferred on the basis that achievement is more similar the more genetically similar individuals are (e.g., the idea that ability runs in families); or it is measured directly by correlating variation in individual letters of DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) to educational outcomes in large samples (though the variation in behaviour explained by direct measures of DNA variation is typically much smaller, perhaps only ~10% instead of the ~50% explained by observing patterns that run in families; e.g., Okbay et al., 2016)", "SES as a measure of the environment is only a proxy for the actual experiences of the child and therefore the actual causal mechanisms. These mechanisms may operate along multiple pathways, and those pathways may differ depending both on the absolute level of poverty across countries and the level of inequality. These pathways include prenatal factors, such as maternal diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress; postnatal nurturing factors, such as early caregiver sensitivity; and the richness of postnatal cognitive stimulation (Hackman, Farah & Meaney, 2010; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2016). Notably, the effects of SES are uneven across cognitive profiles, with relatively greater effects on language development and executive functions, and weaker on visuo-spatial cognition (Farah et al., 2006), although the reasons for this unevenness are unknown.", "There is insufficient space here to evaluate these types of claims (see Thomas et al., 2013; Ashbury & Plomin, 2014; Meaburn, in press). However, we can simply note that a genetic perspective on education emphasises that not all differences between children are environmental in origin; but as yet, does not point to specific implications for teaching. Somewhat counter-intuitively, environments that optimise learning will increase the extent to which educational success is heritable. For example, greater heritability is observed in classes with better teachers (Taylor et al., 2010), as it is in affluent families compared to impoverished ones (Turkheimer et al., 2003). This is because heritability acts as an indicator of where limiting factors lie: when better school environments reduce limits on learning, variability between children is more readily explained by their genetic make-up (Asbury, 2015; Thomas, Kovas, Meaburn & Tolmie, 2015)", "Asbury, K., & Plomin, R.

Yet many cognitive effects of poverty can be ameliorated by intervention, such as training executive functions, because the brain is plastic (Neville et al., 2013); and previously measured genetic effects may disappear when environments are altered. Indeed, the future potential of genetics would be to predict the best, tailored environment for each child to reach his or her genetic potential. However, currently, genetic studies are focused on maximising predictive power (such as by the use of polygenic risk scores, which combine the effects of all measured DNA variation to predict differences in behaviour) \u2013 rather than informing a neuroscientific understanding of the brain mechanisms of learning that would enable such tailoring of environments.\nReferences", "Environmental and genetic causes of individual differences in educational achievement\nBlog written by Professor Michael Thomas\nThe nature-nurture issue is well-known amongst teachers: children differ, and some of these differences are due to the children\u2019s nature, some due to the environment they are raised in, and some a combination of children\u2019s different natural reactions to the environments they are raised in.\nGaps in educational achievement between children are a key issue for society, and their causes have been a focus for research in the social sciences.

In 1909 he observed a small but discrete variation known as white-eye in a single male fly in one of his culture bottles. Aroused by curiosity, he bred the fly with normal (red-eyed) females. All of the offspring (F1) were red-eyed. Brother\u2013sister matings among the F1 generation produced a second generation (F2) with some white-eyed flies, all of which were males. To explain this curious phenomenon, Morgan developed the hypothesis of sex-limited\u2014today called sex-linked\u2014characters, which he postulated were part of the X-chromosome of females. Other genetic variations arose in Morgan\u2019s stock, many of which were also found to be sex-linked. Because all the sex-linked characters were usually inherited together, Morgan became convinced that the X-chromosome carried a number of discrete hereditary units, or factors", "Early in life, Morgan showed an interest in natural history. In 1886 he received the B.S. degree from the State College of Kentucky (later the University of Kentucky) in zoology and then entered Johns Hopkins University for graduate work in biology. At Hopkins, Morgan studied under the morphologist and embryologist William Keith Brooks. After being awarded the Ph.D. in 1890, Morgan remained there a year before accepting a teaching post at Bryn Mawr College.\nExperiments in embryology", ". He adopted the term gene, which was introduced by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909, and concluded that genes were possibly arranged in a linear fashion on chromosomes. Much to his credit, Morgan rejected his skepticism about both the Mendelian and chromosome theories when he saw from two independent lines of evidence\u2014breeding experiments and cytology\u2014that one could be treated in terms of the other.", "., 1928); the latter two works firmly established the Mendelian theory as it applied to heredity in all multicellular (and many unicellular) organisms; and (3) embryology: The Development of the Frog\u2019s Egg: An Introduction to Experimental Embryology (1897), a detailed outline of the developmental stages of frogs\u2019 eggs; Experimental Embryology (1927), Morgan\u2019s statement on the value of experimentation in embryology; and Embryology and Genetics (1934), an attempt to relate the theory of the gene to the problem of embryological differentiation and development.", "During the period 1893\u20131910, Morgan applied experimental techniques to fundamental problems of embryology. In order to identify causally related events during development, he analyzed such problems as the formation of embryos from separated blastomeres (early embryonic cells) and fertilization in nucleated and nonnucleated egg fragments. As examples of the effects of physical factors, he analyzed the way in which the spatial orientation of eggs affects their future development and the action of salt concentration on the development of fertilized and unfertilized eggs. In 1904 he married one of his graduate students at Bryn Mawr, Lillian V. Sampson, a cytologist and embryologist of considerable skill. The same year, he accepted an invitation to assume the professorship of experimental zoology at Columbia University, where, during the next 24 years, he conducted most of his important research in heredity.", "In 1928 Morgan was invited to organize the division of biology of the California Institute of Technology. He was also instrumental in establishing the Marine Laboratory on Corona del Mar as an integral part of Caltech\u2019s biology training program. In subsequent years, Morgan and his coworkers, including a number of postdoctoral and graduate students, continued to elaborate on the many features of the chromosome theory of heredity. Toward the end of his stay at Columbia and more so after moving to California, Morgan himself slipped away from the technical Drosophila work and began to return to his earlier interest in experimental embryology. Although aware of the theoretical links between genetics and development, he found it difficult at that time to draw the connection explicitly and to support it with experimental evidence.", "In 1924 Morgan received the Darwin Medal; in 1933 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of \u201chereditary transmission mechanisms in Drosophila\u201d; and in 1939 he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society of London, of which he was a foreign member.

He showed that genes are linked in a series on chromosomes and are responsible for identifiable, hereditary traits. Morgan\u2019s work played a key role in establishing the field of genetics. He received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1933.\nEarly life\nMorgan\u2019s father, Charlton Hunt Morgan, was a U.S. consul, and his uncle, John Hunt Morgan, had been a Confederate army general.", "Like most embryologists and many biologists at the turn of the century, Morgan found the Darwinian theory of evolution lacking in plausibility. It was difficult to conceive of the development of complex adaptations simply by an accumulation of slight chance variations. Moreover, Darwin had provided no mechanism of heredity to account for the origin or transmission of variations, except his early and hypothetical theory of pangenesis. Although Morgan believed that evolution itself was a fact, the mechanism of natural selection proposed by Darwin seemed incomplete because it could not be put to an experimental test.", "Morgan had quite different objections to the Mendelian and chromosome theories. Both theories attempted to explain biological phenomena by postulating units or material entities in the cell that somehow control developmental events. To Morgan this was too reminiscent of the preformation theory\u2014the idea that the fully formed adult is present in the egg or sperm\u2014that had dominated embryology in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Although Morgan admitted that the chromosomes might have something to do with heredity, he argued in 1909 and 1910 that no single chromosome could carry specific hereditary traits. He also claimed that Mendelian theory was purely hypothetical: although it could account for and even predict breeding results, it could not describe the true processes of heredity", "In collaboration with A.H. Sturtevant, C.B. Bridges, and H.J. Muller, who were graduates at Columbia, Morgan quickly developed the Drosophila work into a large-scale theory of heredity. Particularly important in this work was the demonstration that each Mendelian gene could be assigned a specific position along a linear chromosome \u201cmap.\u201d Further cytological work showed that these map positions could be identified with precise chromosome regions, thus providing definitive proof that Mendel\u2019s factors had a physical basis in chromosome structure. A summary and presentation of the early phases of this work was published by Morgan, Sturtevant, Bridges, and Muller in 1915 as the influential book The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity. To varying degrees Morgan also accepted the Darwinian theory by 1916.", "Among Morgan\u2019s most important books are those dealing with (1) evolution: Evolution and Adaptation (1903), in which he strongly criticizes Darwinian theory; and A Critique of the Theory of Evolution, (1916), a more favourable view of the selection process; (2) heredity: Heredity and Sex (1913), his first major exposition of the Mendelian system in relation to Drosophila; and with A.H.

Something had spontaneously changed in the white-eyed fly.\nMutation does not equal speciation", "The work of scientists such as Morgan established a new science: genetics. It would not be until 1953 that the molecular structure of genes (DNA) would be discovered, and only later did scientists figure out how DNA\u2019s code is used by cells to build proteins. But already by the 1920s, many of the paradoxes about genes that tormented previous biologists dissolved. Genes do not always come in simply two different versions, one dominant and one recessive. Mutations can create many different versions of the same gene (known as alleles). While a single mutation can sometimes create a drastic change to an organism, such as changing red eyes to white, most mutations cannot. That\u2019s because most traits are based on many different genes working together. Mutating any one of those genes often only produces a subtle change, or none at all.", "Scientists realized that the chromosomes stored the information necessary for building an individual, and heredity consisted of the transfer of that information from generation to generation. Each chromosome contained information for many different traits, and scientists dubbed each chromosomal chunk that was responsible for a particular trait a \u201cgene.\u201d\nRediscovering Mendel\nDutch botanist Hugo DeVries and several other scientists carried out breeding experiments in the late 1890s and rediscovered Mendel\u2019s three-to-one ratio. But this new generation could offer a clearer interpretation of what was happening in their experiments. We each carry two copies of the same gene, one from each parent, but in many cases only one copy produces a trait while the action of the other is masked. Here was the secret behind Mendel\u2019s three-to-one ratio of smooth and wrinkled peas.\nMutated gene = new species?", "In 1900 several scientists across Europe came to the same realization about heredity that Mendel had some 40 years before. But they arrived at the discovery from a very different direction.\nChromosomes contain genetic material\nNineteenth century cell biologists discovered that animal and plant cells had a central compartment known as the nucleus. Each nucleus contained a set of rod-shaped structures, and when a typical cell divided, a new nucleus complete with a new set of rods was created. These rods were named chromosomes for the way they absorbed colored stains. But sperm and eggs contained only half the normal set of chromosomes. When a sperm fertilized an egg, the chromosomes combined to create a full complement.", "Morgan realized that one of its genes had been altered and it had produced a new kind of eye. Morgan bred the white-eyed fly with a red-eyed fly and got a generation of red-eyed hybrids. And when he bred the hybrids together, some of the grandchildren were white-eyed. Their ratio was three red to one white. Here was a mutation, but one that didn\u2019t fit DeVries\u2019s definition. DeVries thought that mutations created new species, but the fly that had acquired the white-eyed mutation remained a member of the same species. It could still mate with other fruit flies, and its gene could be passed down to later generations in proper Mendelian fashion.\nGenetics is born"], "title": "Chromosomes, Mutation, and the Birth of Modern Genetics: Thomas Hunt Morgan"}, "https://www.britannica.com/biography/W-I-Thomas": {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/W-I-Thomas", "description": "W.

Screening is expensive, for instance, increasing the odds that privileged students will qualify for extra enrichment or support before their less privileged peers.", "Measuring a person\u2019s genetic advantage (or disadvantage) also allows scientists to control for it in their studies. That is, they can better study factors that society can change, such as spending on special programs, compulsory education and school interventions, without having their results biased by a sample of students who are genetically advantaged or disadvantaged.\nAnd researchers can use the polygenic score to assess whether a school has failed students with high potential \u2014 or if an intervention helped retain children who were otherwise likely to drop out. In the math paper published in February, Domingue, Harden, and their colleagues found that some schools better supported high school students with low polygenic scores than others, ensuring those kids stayed in school.", "Using data from more than a million people across countries, researchers found the polygenic score could explain 11 percent of the variation in educational attainment.

But recent research has raised another possibility \u2014 one that is discomforting to many \u2014 the idea that scientists might someday be able to spot the genetic markers associated with academic performance.\nTo do this, researchers are turning to a relatively new genetic approach called the polygenic score, which assesses a person\u2019s likelihood for a specific future based on a combination of genetic variables. It\u2019s a research technique that some scientists are using to assess obesity or cancer risk, for instance. Now, researchers are exploring this approach in non-medical contexts, like academic or athletic success.", "But the relationship could be nuanced. Domingue pointed out that there could be genetic factors that make a person more likely to be a supportive parent, which, in turn, would correlate to better school performance in their children. Because the child and parent share DNA, the polygenic score could capture gene variants in the child that explain educational performance but actually reflect the parent\u2019s behavior.\nThere is also an enormous shortcoming in the datasets used for this research: Virtually all are built with DNA from people of European ancestry. Although there are biobanks in the works in Asia and Africa that could address this omission, for the time being, the scores are essentially only applicable to people of European descent. \u201cYou\u2019re basically developing a tool that\u2019s only useful for one segment of the population,\u201d Harden said.", "The scientists studying genetic markers in education are trying to untangle how nature and nurture together explain school performance. In principle, genetic screening might enable teachers to tailor their approach to groups of students. Educators might then more effectively instruct kids together in one classroom, rather than separating students into accelerated and low-level courses, which can deprive Black and brown children and children from low-income families of academic opportunities.\nBut some researchers fear this gene screening work could be misapplied and used to further racist or eugenic thinking, even though race is a social, not a genetic, classification. There\u2019s an ugly history of proponents of eugenics, who believe in reshaping humanity by breeding \u201csuperior traits\u201d and removing \u201cinferior traits,\u201d justifying their thinking with genetics.

If you're pregnant, tests can detect some types of abnormalities in your baby's genes. Down syndrome and trisomy 18 syndrome are two genetic disorders that are often screened for as part of prenatal genetic testing. Traditionally this is done looking at markers in blood or by invasive testing such as amniocentesis. Newer testing called cell-free DNA testing looks at a baby's DNA via a blood test done on the mother.\n- Newborn screening. This is the most common type of genetic testing. In the United States, all states require that newborns be tested for certain genetic and metabolic abnormalities that cause specific conditions. This type of genetic testing is important because if results show there's a disorder such as congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disease or phenylketonuria (PKU), care and treatment can begin right away.", "- Presymptomatic and predictive testing. If you have a family history of a genetic condition, getting genetic testing before you have symptoms may show if you're at risk of developing that condition.

If you have a family history of a genetic disorder \u2014 such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis \u2014 or you're in an ethnic group that has a high risk of a specific genetic disorder, you may choose to have genetic testing before having children. An expanded carrier screening test can detect genes associated with a wide variety of genetic diseases and mutations and can identify if you and your partner are carriers for the same conditions.\n- Pharmacogenetics.

Genetic testing can reveal changes (mutations) in your genes that may cause illness or disease.\nAlthough genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing, treating and preventing illness, there are limitations. For example, if you're a healthy person, a positive result from genetic testing doesn't always mean you will develop a disease. On the other hand, in some situations, a negative result doesn't guarantee that you won't have a certain disorder.\nTalking to your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor about what you will do with the results is an important step in the process of genetic testing.\nGenome sequencing\nWhen genetic testing doesn't lead to a diagnosis but a genetic cause is still suspected, some facilities offer genome sequencing \u2014 a process for analyzing a sample of DNA taken from your blood."], "title": "Genetic testing - Mayo Clinic"}, "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2021/aug/parents-genes-can-influence-childs-educational-success-inherited-or-not": {"url": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2021/aug/parents-genes-can-influence-childs-educational-success-inherited-or-not", "description": "The researchers found that genetic nurture had about half as much impact on education success as genetic inheritance. ... \u201cThis study illustrates how complex the relationship between genes and the environment is.

That value puts the score on par with factors like a mother\u2019s level of education attainment, which explains 15 percent of variation, and household income, which explains about 7 percent.\n\u201cThere are genes that affect educational attainment \u2014 that is for certain now,\u201d said Aysu Okbay, an economist at Vrije Universiteit in the Netherlands who contributed to the 2016 and 2018 studies.\nThe score\u2019s ability to explain variation in years of schooling could improve with more data. Rough estimates indicate about 80 percent of the variation in educational attainment comes from environmental factors \u2014 the rest is genetic. With enough data, some scientists believe, the polygenic score could get close to explaining 20 percent of the difference in people\u2019s level of education.", "Indeed, the idea of predicting students\u2019 academic performance based on their genes comes with such a raft of ethical questions and unknowns that scientists in the field are urging caution. \u201cPolygenic scores are a potentially useful new scientific tool. At the same time, there are clear reasons to be concerned,\u201d Stanford University social scientist Ben Domingue said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the capacity, with a vial of spit, to be able to predict all these different things.\u201d\nScientists and ethicists are also concerned about commercializing this work while the research is still evolving.

It\u2019s a research technique that some scientists are using to assess obesity or cancer risk, for instance. Now, researchers are exploring this approach in non-medical contexts, like academic or athletic success.", "Researchers in the field want to see more critical discussion of how their work could be applied in educational settings. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pay attention now, systems will be created, constructed around us, responding to our genetic difference,\u201d said Sophie von Stumm, a psychologist at the University of York, in the United Kingdom, who studies genetics and education. \u201cIt\u2019s high time to have this discussion. Honestly, we\u2019re late to the party.\u201d\nRelated: College graduation may be partly determined by your genes, genome study of siblings finds\nThe polygenic score that could help predict academic performance aims to assess genetic markers related to educational attainment. In other words, it combines hundreds of common genetic variants that are linked to the number of years a person stays in school. In 2016, this score could explain about 5 percent of the variation in the level of education completed.", "Given all of these limitations, most scientists believe it would be unlikely, and inappropriate, for educators to use polygenic scores to determine student placement in specific classes or schools. \u201cWill someone be mad enough to track or stream on the basis of genetic predispositions?\u201d von Stumm said. \u201cFortunately, I think we\u2019re far from that.\u201d\nThere could be other ways of using this genetic information. Once genetic variants are better understood and enough data is in hand, for example, it might be possible to identify children with a predisposition to learning disabilities and intervene early. In May, von Stumm and her colleagues published a paper exploring whether a toddler\u2019s polygenic score for educational attainment could identify children at risk for language or literacy delays later in life. The conclusion: We\u2019re not there yet.", "Critics caution that there is too much to establish ethically and scientifically before we confront those scenarios. \u201cSomeday we\u2019ll understand the genetic contribution to educational success or to life success but it will be our grandchildren who understand it. It won\u2019t be us,\u201d bioethicist Arthur Caplan at NYU Langone Health said.\nAnd even if we understood this information, it\u2019s not clear how to best use the scores in schools. Last year, Stanford\u2019s Domingue and two colleagues wrote about a hypothetical case study: What happens when a parent tries to use genetic data, like a polygenic score, to make the case that their child deserves additional classroom support?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I have good answers to that,\u201d he said. But the scenario hints at another serious concern: inequality. Not everyone will be able to afford genetic screening, even when there are meaningful scores for people across ancestries.", "And researchers can use the polygenic score to assess whether a school has failed students with high potential \u2014 or if an intervention helped retain children who were otherwise likely to drop out. In the math paper published in February, Domingue, Harden, and their colleagues found that some schools better supported high school students with low polygenic scores than others, ensuring those kids stayed in school.\nHarden hopes to see the science applied in ways that emphasize social justice and provide resources to programs that need them: \u201cThat\u2019s how I think we should be using the polygenic scores \u2014 if we use them at all.\u201d\nSign up for The Hechinger Report\u2019s newsletter.", "Still, researchers are already using the polygenic score to explore long-standing conundrums like why children with very similar advantages follow different trajectories in life.\n\u201cWe are all subject to a big genetic lottery that corresponds to an environmental lottery,\u201d von Stumm said. She added that research into the links between genetics and academic attainment could push people to examine \u201cfairness\u201d in meritocratic societies, given that some people may carry genetic strengths that give them a slight but significant academic advantage, that, in turn, improves other aspects of their lives.\nMeasuring a person\u2019s genetic advantage (or disadvantage) also allows scientists to control for it in their studies. That is, they can better study factors that society can change, such as spending on special programs, compulsory education and school interventions, without having their results biased by a sample of students who are genetically advantaged or disadvantaged.", "If so, the score would be an incredibly powerful single factor for making predictions about an individual\u2019s academic future \u2014 even though the combined environmental variables still eclipse the role of genes. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a puny predictor at this point,\u201d Domingue said.\nIn February, Domingue and his colleagues found that the polygenic score could help identify which groups of high schoolers had been placed into advanced math classes. The score could also point to students most likely to stick with advanced math courses across all four years of high school.\nBut polygenic scores also come laced with caveats. So many, in fact, that Okbay and her colleagues published a massive list of public FAQs \u2014 including how the study was designed and whether the research could lead to stigmatization of people with certain genes \u2014 to help readers interpret their research.\nFor more of NBC News' in-depth reporting, download the NBC News app", "The scientists studying genetic markers in education are trying to untangle how nature and nurture together explain school performance. In principle, genetic screening might enable teachers to tailor their approach to groups of students. Educators might then more effectively instruct kids together in one classroom, rather than separating students into accelerated and low-level courses, which can deprive Black and brown children and children from low-income families of academic opportunities.\nBut some researchers fear this gene screening work could be misapplied and used to further racist or eugenic thinking, even though race is a social, not a genetic, classification. There\u2019s an ugly history of proponents of eugenics, who believe in reshaping humanity by breeding \u201csuperior traits\u201d and removing \u201cinferior traits,\u201d justifying their thinking with genetics. And there are debunked racist theories that have endeavored to falsely connect race and intelligence.", "But the relationship could be nuanced. Domingue pointed out that there could be genetic factors that make a person more likely to be a supportive parent, which, in turn, would correlate to better school performance in their children. Because the child and parent share DNA, the polygenic score could capture gene variants in the child that explain educational performance but actually reflect the parent\u2019s behavior.\nThere is also an enormous shortcoming in the datasets used for this research: Virtually all are built with DNA from people of European ancestry. Although there are biobanks in the works in Asia and Africa that could address this omission, for the time being, the scores are essentially only applicable to people of European descent. \u201cYou\u2019re basically developing a tool that\u2019s only useful for one segment of the population,\u201d Harden said.\nRelated: Gifted classes may not help talented students move ahead faster"], "title": "A new way of predicting which kids will succeed in school: Look at ..."}, "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180905-how-genes-influence-achievement-and-success-in-school": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180905-how-genes-influence-achievement-and-success-in-school", "description": "There has been considerable recent success in identifying genetic variants associated with educational attainment through what are called genome-wide association studies (GWAS).", "snippets": ["A more powerful method was recently developed that sums up thousands of the genetic markers found in the GWAS studies to instead calculate a genome-wide \u2018polygenic score\u2019.

They could then be provided with individualised learning programmes.\nFor example, we could use DNA tests at birth to identify children at genetic risk for developing reading problems and give them early intervention. As preventive interventions have greater chances of succeeding early in life, a great strength of polygenic scores is that they can predict at birth just as well as later in life, which could be of particular help for those children who are likely to struggle the most.\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.", "It\u2019s reasonable to assume that this substantial influence of genes on the continuity of children\u2019s achievement during their time at school can be explained by intelligence.

There has been considerable recent success in identifying genetic variants associated with educational attainment through what are called genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

However, many models have disease-specific predictors. Various studies have found that, when treated the same as other risk factors, PGS contributes independent information that improves the accuracy of these risk prediction models , and studies continue to show that PGS modestly improve risk prediction when combined into an IRT for diseases of major public health burden, including coronary heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , and breast cancer .

GWAS information, either individual-level or summary statistics, can be leveraged to estimate an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition for a given phenotype . This genetic predisposition is typically represented as a score and is referred to as a polygenic score (PGS), polygenic risk score (PRS) or genetic/genomic risk score (GRS). PGS are based on cost-effective technology (e.g. genome-wide genotyping array or sequencing) which, since it is measuring the germline genome, only needs to be performed once in an individual\u2019s lifetime. Further, PGS for hundreds of diseases and/or clinically relevant traits can be calculated from one genome-wide array or sequence.", "A key challenge for the utility of PGS is to ensure they make equitable predictions for all groups; however, many PGS have weaker predictive performance between populations defined by their genetic ancestry  and within some sub-groups of a single ancestry group . This issue, which is common to other biomarkers and risk models, is often called the transferability (or portability) gap and, in this case, refers to the relative predictive ability of a PGS in samples that are external to the PGS development populations. It should be noted that some attenuation of predictive performance (e.g., effect size, accuracy, R2) is expected and can be based on differences between the training cohort and that being evaluated (e.g., demographic differences, social determinants of health, case ascertainment/phenotyping), which is why external validation is a critical step in any risk model evaluation ", ". A potential solution is to use whole genome sequencing; however, the cost of whole genome sequencing still inhibits large-scale implementation.

As is the case with other risk factors, disease prevalence may affect the performance of a PGS \u2014 for example, for a disease with a prevalence of 1% (e.g. schizophrenia), the top 10% of a current PGS would only identify 3% of patients . However, PGS can still be useful for risk stratification in high-risk groups of low-prevalence diseases (e.g.T1D ), or used in combination with other risk factors to define a higher-than-average risk population in which to screen. Thus, PGS may be useful for changing the age and/or frequency at which people are screened for cardiovascular risk factors, common cancers (e.g. breast, prostate, colorectal), and other conditions (e.g. dementias)", "Age is the strongest risk factor for most common diseases and contributes to the baseline risk profile along with the accumulation of other risk factors. As such, analyses show that PGS is a stronger predictor of disease incidence earlier in the life course , which motivates measuring genetics earlier in life for targeted prevention and screening before the accumulation of risk factors and environmental exposures. While age affects genetic relative risk for many common diseases as captured by PGS , a recent study of prostate cancer illustrates the utility of PGS for absolute risk-stratification despite age-related attenuation of relative risk . Taken together, there is now a strong evidence base across many diseases that PGS captures disease risk information that is independent of other risk factors and improves integrated risk calculators.\nAssessing the clinical utility of polygenic scores", "Lee A, Yang X, Tyrer J, Gentry-Maharaj A, Ryan A, Mavaddat N, Cunningham AP, Carver T, Archer S, Leslie G.

Clinical trials can be large in scale and expensive to run in order to accumulate the numbers of outcomes to measure an effect; thus, to achieve this, trials often enrol individuals at high risk of the outcome. Fahed et al. showed how using a PGS might reduce trial sample size by focusing on individuals at high polygenic risk to increase the outcome rate. A PGS-guided trial strategy might be especially useful for preventative interventions in high-risk individuals before disease onset (e.g. before cognitive impairment in dementias or Alzheimer\u2019s disease ) or in those individuals who are susceptible to T1D .

Typically PGS have been developed in cohorts of genotyped individuals using a limited set of directly measured variants on a genotyping array, which has been imputed to higher genome coverage using reference panels . Recent studies have shown that the choice of imputation panel and strategy can affect PGS accuracy , and the choice of genotyping array can be particularly important for underrepresented populations . Ideally, the clinical use of PGS should combine common and rare variants , even if the improvements to risk-stratification at the population level may be limited .

Adherence to reporting standards and key metadata requirements describing how the PGS was developed and evaluated can achieve this goal , as different studies often report PGS metrics with different statistics and covariate adjustments that make comparisons difficult. During the reporting of PGS/IRT development, it is important to describe participant inclusion, as the labels we use to describe populations can be imprecise or comprise outdated language that can cause harm and misinterpretation (see NASEM review ). Consistent with what many have advised, the NASEM report recommended that we should not use race as a proxy for human genetic variation nor as part of PGS, and one should carefully consider any labels applied when grouping individuals.

Genetic predisposition to disease can be partially captured by family history; however, family history is a composite variable that captures both shared environment and genetic similarity that is often incomplete and poorly captured . As such, PGS has been shown to add information beyond family history in phenotype prediction for a child based on the average of their parents (mid-parent) for traits like height  and risk of common diseases . Family history may also correlate with the presence of familial forms of disease caused by rare pathogenic variants, and most genetic tests implemented in current clinical practice assess a variant\u2019s occurrence in familial and sporadic disease cases", "Lewis CM, Vassos E.

Both GWAS and PGS should be shared with clear and unambiguous license terms (ideally CC0 or, if necessary, CC-BY-NC) to ensure reusability for the widest range of research and clinical applications.", "Another challenge in PGS calculation is that scores are often on different scales (different mean and variance), and different genetic ancestry groups can have shifted PGS distributions that do not reflect differences in the disease prevalence . Thus the main way to convert a PGS into an interpretable individual measure is to represent it as a relative risk of where an individual sits in a population distribution. In a cohort of genetically similar individuals, one can simply normalize the PGS for the mean and standard deviation of the population of interest or use percentiles; however, this becomes challenging for diverse ancestries and/or admixed individuals. One way to calculate an individual\u2019s PGS is to use a population reference panel (e.g. 1000 Genomes Project) and report an individual's relative PGS with respect to the most similar population in the panel", "The utility of a PGS ultimately depends on its predictive ability and the clinical scenario in which it is applied . Here we highlight examples of clinical scenarios where a PGS has been proposed to have the potential for utility.\nRisk stratification", "Developing, calculating, and applying PGS is a data-intensive endeavour, and should strive to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR, ) in order to maximize PGS reproducibility and utility as research and potentially clinical tools. PGS are typically constructed using coefficients from GWAS, and as such it is critical that the GWAS summary statistics are openly shared and reusable by other researchers. Sharing data via a recognized repository, such as the GWAS Catalog , where data is stably accessioned and made available in a standard format facilitates the linking of PGS to source data. High-quality study and variant-level metadata in GWAS summary statistics (e.g. imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes) are required for accurate PGS development and input to many methods . As many fields are underreported in shared GWAS summary statistics (e.g", ". It is also well-documented that the attenuation in PGS predictive ability is proportional to the genetic distance from the training population . Over 95% of recent GWAS study participants have been of European ancestry . Several recent reviews  have also acknowledged the transferability issue of PGS.", ". Statistical methods, tools and resources also should be improved to facilitate analysis of genetic ancestry on a continuum, particularly so that admixed individuals are not excluded from studies . The standardization of GWAS/PGS results reporting, responsible use and communication will require a concerted effort from academic, industry and government bodies. Overall, through community efforts towards common goals, it is clear that continued progress in PGS is being made and that it could benefit human health. There is now a substantive need for further translational studies, including pragmatic trials, to provide empirical evidence as to PGS utility in specific clinical scenarios.", "While analytic solutions (including methods development and modelling of baseline risk) are being developed, the lack of diverse genomic data continues to be an important limitation. While it will take substantial time to recruit participants from historically underrepresented groups and to generate genomic data, the most effective strategy at the moment is to leverage multi-biobank resources, e.g. the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative . Many wealthy countries like the USA and UK are recruiting and delivering the next phase of larger and more diverse biobanks (e.g. the All of US Program  and Our Future Health ). However, continued efforts should ensure that the benefits of PGS are not only available to those in wealthy countries and capacity building and ethical partnerships for data collection and analysis in underrepresented groups, particularly low-middle income countries, should be promoted ", "The evidence for the clinical utility of PGS is continuously developing, but PGS are already used in some risk tools implemented in clinical practice, and select preventative genomics clinics. In the near-term, it is likely that the continued deployment of PGS in clinics will rely on extending conventional risk models into integrated risk tools enhanced by PGS (e.g. CanRisk ). Despite their manifold potential benefits, PGS have inherent risks and limitations, similar to other risk factors, such as variable portability across genetic ancestry groups. While improvements to PGS development methods can partially overcome these limitations, the only genuine solution is to increase the representation of diverse samples in the GWAS . The open sharing of this genomic data and the developed PGS should be openly shared according to FAIR principles  and established reporting guidelines  to maximize equitable translation of these results", "More transferrable PGS can also be developed by using improved statistical methods (see  for a recent comprehensive review of PGS development methodologies). The major advancements used to close the transferability gap are primarily based on ensembling and leveraging multi-ancestry and multi-trait data and incorporating functional information to identify more likely causal variants. Ensembling-based methods are based on the idea that incorporating multiple sets of GWAS data from either multiple ancestries or multiple diseases/risk factors can create a better set of variants and weights for PGS calculation. One such approach is PRS-CSx , an extension of the population PRS-CS continuous shrinkage (CS) models that can be shared across ancestries. Another example of ensembling is CT-SLEB  which integrates clumping and thresholding, empirical Bayes and super learning to process multi-ancestry GWAS data into a single PGS", "Barnes DR, Rookus MA, McGuffog L, Leslie G, Mooij TM, Dennis J, Mavaddat N, Adlard J, Ahmed M, Aittom\u00e4ki K.

There is also additional work to be done to develop best practices for calculating individuals' PGS, both in genotyping assay and/or imputation choices and how to calculate and report a person\u2019s risk. As with many tools already utilized for disease risk prediction (e.g. QRISK ), there is an absence or paucity of randomized trial evidence as to their clinical benefit and there are various reasons for this, e.g. the vast number of PGS, clinical use cases, number of patients needed and corresponding scarce resources . Alongside efforts to conduct pragmatic trials of PGS, large-scale validation together with rigorous clinical and population health modelling should continue.

Ambitions to introduce widespread polygenic scoring for prostate cancer would require unprecedented investment in diagnostic imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which is a constrained resource in the UK.24\nWhat might people expect from polygenic scores?", "We need to invest in tackling lifestyle risk factors for disease through, for example, \u201cstop smoking\u201d initiatives and policies that make it easier to afford to make healthy diet and exercise choices. We also need to work to remove barriers to accessing existing effective screening and treatments. Although polygenic scores have the potential to subtly improve our ability to predict who will and will not develop disease, most disease will occur in people who do not have a high score. We argue that enthusiasm around polygenic scores should not detract from efforts to tackle big, modifiable environmental risk factors, which have generalisable and population-wide utility\u2014we need to get the cake tasting better before we work too hard on the icing.", ". With theoretical best possible polygenic scores, for example, people in the highest 1% of polygenic scores for breast cancer would have a relative risk of four times the average risk; for prostate cancer, five times; for colorectal cancer, 3.5 times.9", "It is tempting to imagine that there will be a transformative improvement in the predictive ability of polygenic scores through the discovery of more genetic risk variants. But modelling shows that, even in the theoretical scenario that all common genetic risk variants are identified and used in a polygenic score, they will still be limited in their ability to differentiate between those who will and will not develop disease. Zhang et al calculated the maximum predictive ability achievable with polygenic scores for various cancers and found that they hit a ceiling. In the case of breast cancer, for example, with a specificity set at 95%, the best achievable sensitivity would be 19% (4% better than current scores). At the extremes of the distribution, that is for a small number of people, they have the scope to be clinically useful", "Generating an integrated risk tool by adding a polygenic score for coronary artery disease to the pooled cohort equation or QRISK score (clinical models for estimating a person\u2019s risk of an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event over the next 10 years) improves predictive accuracy by 3-4%.1011 This integrated risk tool has been lauded as \u201csubstantially enhanc[ing]\u201d coronary artery disease prediction and has been piloted in a collaboration between the NHS and the healthcare company Genomics in 836 general practice patients in the HEART study.12 If this integrated risk tool were to be used, assuming that everyone exceeding the specified risk cut-off receives and takes a statin (which results in a 20% relative risk reduction), 8713 people would need to undergo integrated risk testing to prevent one additional coronary artery disease event", "Balancing the benefits and harms of polygenic scores in clinical practice\nGiven the intrinsically limited predictive abilities of polygenic scores, a popular approach in research studies has been to integrate such scores into existing prediction models that also consider other risk factors, aiming to give a more holistic overview of disease risk. Using this strategy, polygenic scores stand to slightly improve risk prediction.", "Some evidence indicates that polygenic scores have the potential to be misunderstood and cause distress. A survey of 227 people accessing polygenic scores online without counselling for a wide variety of diseases (including some without clear preventive or treatment options) found that only 25.6% answered all questions relating to understanding and interpretation of polygenic scores correctly, but 60.8% experienced some degree of negative reaction (upset, anxious, or sad on the \u201cfeelings about genomic testing results\u201d scale) after receiving their results. A lower understanding of polygenic scores was associated with a negative psychological reaction.31 Research exploring how best to communicate these scores and what they do and do not mean will therefore be essential if polygenic scores are to be widely adopted clinically.", "Realistic expectations are key to realising the benefits of polygenic scores\nBMJ 2023; 380 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2022-073149 (Published 01 March 2023) Cite this as: BMJ 2023;380:e073149- Amit Sud, academic clinical lecturer12,\n- Rachel H Horton, clinical research fellow345,\n- Aroon D Hingorani, professor of genetic epidemiology and director6789,\n- Ioanna Tzoulaki, professor of chronic disease epidemiology101112,\n- Clare Turnbull, professor in translational cancer genetics113,\n- Richard S Houlston, professor in cancer genomics1,\n- Anneke Lucassen, professor of genomic medicine and director4514\n- 1Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK\n- 2Haemato-oncology Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, UK\n- 3Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK\n- 4Clinical Ethics, Law, and Society Group, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK", "Proponents could argue that being informed of high polygenic risk might prompt helpful lifestyle changes, although evidence is lacking. A 2016 meta analysis found that people tend not to change their lifestyle on the basis of genetic results, and a study of nearly 1000 blood donors found that provision of polygenic risk information for coronary heart disease did not affect objectively measured levels of physical activity and other health related behaviours.2829 An observational follow-up study of 7342 people in their 50s found that communication of high cardiovascular risk (based on a composite score incorporating both traditional and polygenic risk) was associated with better health behaviour, but, because everyone in the study had polygenic testing, we cannot know whether people offered a traditional risk score alone would have made similar changes.30", "Polygenic scores offer the possibility of assessing a person\u2019s genetic risk for multiple diseases simultaneously, at any point in their life course. But they do not consider the effects of environmental or poorly understood non-genetic factors that contribute to most common diseases. Thus, polygenic scores will always remain one of many risk factors and will never reach a point where they can accurately predict who will and will not develop disease.6", "A further concern is that, in the future, insurers might seek to use polygenic scores to determine eligibility, given the prospect of widespread polygenic score use increasing information asymmetry between insurers and their customers.3233 Since 2001, the UK insurance industry has followed a code setting limitations on the use of health related genomic information in determining eligibility for insurance, but this code is voluntary and designed to cover single gene risk factors such as BRCA variants.\nNon-genetic risk factors need greater attention\nThe development and use of polygenic scores is attracting money and attention, but, for most common diseases, unglamorous but well established risk factors like smoking, obesity, and socioeconomic deprivation matter more than a person\u2019s genetic background. Childhood postcode, for example, is probably as good a predictor of risk for most common diseases as most polygenic scores.34", "Many hope that polygenic scores will improve cancer screening programmes through early or more frequent screening for those at higher polygenic risk. It has been proposed, for example, that annual mammography should be offered to women aged 40-50 with polygenic scores that indicate they are at moderate or high risk of breast cancer.3 This has the potential to detect 1700 more cancers, but at the cost of 5722 false positive results and with 4112 cancers still being missed.8141516Figure 2 uses 100 person diagrams to indicate how polygenic scores might perform for cancer detection in people not currently offered cancer screening in the UK.", "Polygenic scores will always be limited in their ability to predict disease, as much of a person\u2019s disease risk is determined by factors that polygenic scores cannot measure\nIf we do not effectively communicate this limitation, we risk overemphasising the role of polygenic scores, which could undermine current effective screening programmes\nThe enthusiasm around polygenic scores must not distract from efforts to tackle modifiable risk factors for disease", "A further point to note is that the variants used in polygenic scores are established in genome-wide association studies, and over 95% of participants in these studies are European (https://gwasdiversitymonitor.com/).35 These scores will typically have lower predictive accuracy when applied to people with non-European ancestry. Although, as we argue above, polygenic scores at best only slightly improve each person\u2019s risk prediction, the use of polygenic scores is set to benefit people with European ancestry more than anyone else. Our Future Health seeks to address this by trying to recruit a diverse range of people to the study, but it is important to remember that at present, where polygenic scores work, they may widen gaps.", "Enthusiasm surrounds government reports on polygenic scores, with the Genome UK report describing them as offering a \u201cstep change\u201d in screening for disease.1 The UK NHS will offer risk information based on polygenic scores to five million people as part of Our Future Health, which is set to become the UK\u2019s largest health research programme.23 Such information is expected to inform clinical decisions including access to screening.4 Amid the hope that polygenic scores will \u201cchange the whole paradigm of healthcare,\u201d5 we should recognise that these scores are limited in their potential to predict disease.

A study looking population screening for colorectal cancer found that adding a polygenic score to faecal immunochemical testing did not improve the diagnostic accuracy but did add complexity and cost.19 In situations such as this, where existing screening is already effective and cheap but not well taken up, polygenic scores could worsen outcomes if people take \u201clow risk\u201d scores as a reason to disengage from screening altogether.20 Although we do not know how likely this would be if polygenic scores were offered at scale, there are indications from a cohort study that provided personalised breast cancer risk estimates: of 127 000 women invited to participate, 46% accepted risk estimation, and attendance at the first screening appointment was slightly reduced among women estimated to be at \u201cbelow average\u201d risk.21", ". AS and RHH contributed equally.", "Polygenic scores look at thousands of genetic variants across a person\u2019s genome to estimate their risk of developing a specific disease. Each individual genetic variant has a small effect on a person\u2019s disease risk, but by looking at all the variants together, something clinically meaningful might be said about their overall risk of developing a disease. This is in contrast to monogenic variants, such cancer predisposing BRCA variants, where a variant in a single gene has a very marked effect on a person\u2019s disease risk. Polygenic scores can, in theory, be developed for any disease for which genetics influences risk, but the two areas in which their use has most widely been described are cancer and coronary artery disease. We focus on these in our article.", "As with any screening tool, understanding the sensitivity and specificity of polygenic scores is essential to evaluate their clinical utility. A 2022 preprint evaluating polygenic scores in disease prevention indicates that, with specificity set at 95% (meaning that 5% of people who will not develop the disease will have a high polygenic score), the typical sensitivity for a polygenic score is 10-15% (meaning that only 10-15% of people who will develop the disease will have a high polygenic score)7\u2014for example, a polygenic score developed to detect women at >17% lifetime risk of breast cancer has a sensitivity of 39% (it will identify 39% of the women who will go on to develop breast cancer, but miss 61% of them) and a specificity of 78% (22% of women who will not go onto develop breast cancer will be classified as having a \u201chigh risk score\u201d).78 Increasing the sensitivity of a polygenic score reduces the specificity, and vice versa (fig 1).", "Risk is notoriously difficult to communicate, and supporting people in understanding the results of their polygenic scores could put major strain on the health service. People with \u201chigh risk\u201d scores might want to discuss their results with a clinician, even when their absolute risk is still small, and further costs might accrue depending on decisions around future screening. Conversely, people who do not have \u201chigh risk\u201d polygenic scores might be less likely to seek medical attention for concerning symptoms, or their clinicians might be less inclined to investigate. This is concerning, as most people who develop disease will not have a high polygenic score.", "Without wider conversations between the public, researchers, healthcare providers, and policy makers around their limitations, polygenic scores are vulnerable to misinterpretation. Unlike other factors that might subtly nudge a person\u2019s risk one way or another, people might read more into \u201cgenetic\u201d tests.2526 In 2019, for example, the then UK health secretary Matt Hancock told the Royal Society that having a polygenic score for prostate cancer \u201cmay have saved my life\u201d and he would ensure that he did not \u201cmiss any screening appointments in the future\u201d after being told that he had a 15% risk of developing prostate cancer by age 75, neglecting to mention that the background population risk is 13% and that there is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK.27", "Contributors and sources: AS is an academic clinical lecturer in haemato-oncology, genetics and epidemiology at the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

By understanding how genetic predispositions interact with environmental factors, we can develop more targeted and effective treatments for mental health disorders and other psychological issues.\nThe Verdict: A Harmonious Blend\nAs we\u2019ve journeyed through the landscape of the nature-nurture debate, one thing has become abundantly clear: there is no clear winner. Our genetic makeup and our environmental experiences are inextricably linked, each influencing and being influenced by the other in a complex dance of development.", "Behavioral genetics, for instance, has moved beyond simply asking whether a trait is heritable to exploring how specific genes interact with environmental factors to influence behavior. This field of study has revealed that most complex traits and behaviors are influenced by multiple genes, each with a small effect, rather than by a single \u201cgene for\u201d a particular trait.\nThe emerging field of epigenetics has added another layer of complexity to our understanding. Epigenetic changes \u2013 modifications to gene expression that don\u2019t alter the DNA sequence itself \u2013 can be influenced by environmental factors and can even be passed down to future generations. This discovery blurs the line between nature and nurture in fascinating ways.", "This interplay is evident in the concept of developmental plasticity \u2013 the idea that our brains are most malleable during certain critical periods in our development. During these windows of opportunity, environmental influences can have a profound impact on our neural connections and, consequently, our abilities and behaviors.\nThe theory of reciprocal determinism, proposed by psychologist Albert Bandura, takes this idea even further. It suggests that our behavior, environment, and personal factors (including genetic predispositions) all influence each other in a continuous feedback loop. We\u2019re not just passive recipients of genetic and environmental influences; we actively shape our environment, which in turn shapes us.\nNature vs Nurture in Developmental Psychology: Unraveling the Threads of Growth", "Developmental psychology offers a unique lens through which to view the nature-nurture debate. It allows us to observe how genetic and environmental factors interact over time to shape an individual\u2019s growth and behavior.\nTake cognitive development, for instance. Jean Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development proposes that children go through distinct stages of mental growth. While the sequence of these stages appears to be universal (suggesting a genetic component), the rate at which children progress through them can vary widely based on their environment and experiences.\nAttachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, provides another fascinating example of the nature-nurture interplay. While infants seem to have an innate drive to form attachments with caregivers (nature), the quality of these attachments is heavily influenced by the responsiveness and consistency of care they receive (nurture).", "On the other side of the coin, we have nurture \u2013 the environmental factors that shape us throughout our lives. This includes everything from our family dynamics and cultural background to our education and life experiences. Nurture in psychology: Definition, theories, and impact on human development explores how these external influences mold our personalities and behaviors.\nImagine the mind as a garden. Our genes might determine what types of plants can grow, but it\u2019s the environment \u2013 the soil, sunlight, and care \u2013 that determines how well they thrive.

Through the use of advanced genetic technologies and techniques, researchers have made significant strides in understanding the complex interplay between nature and nurture.\nGenetics research has revealed that certain traits and characteristics are determined by the genetic makeup of an individual. Through the study of DNA and gene expression, scientists have identified specific genes that play a role in various aspects of human development, such as intelligence, personality traits, and physical characteristics.", "Genes play a significant role in influencing intelligence. Numerous studies have shown the heritability of intelligence, indicating that genetic factors contribute to individual differences in cognitive abilities. These genetic factors can influence brain structure, neurotransmitter function, and the efficiency of neural pathways related to intelligence.\nHowever, the environment also plays a vital role in shaping an individual\u2019s intelligence. Environmental factors, such as access to education, socio-economic status, cultural stimulation, and early childhood experiences, have a profound impact on cognitive development. Adequate nutrition, exposure to a rich language environment, and intellectual stimulation during critical periods of brain development can enhance intellectual abilities.", "Nurturing plays a crucial role in shaping an individual\u2019s personality traits, but there is also evidence to suggest that certain traits are heavily influenced by genetic inheritance. Researchers have identified specific genes that are associated with different personality traits, such as extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness.\nHowever, it is important to note that genetic predisposition does not guarantee the development of specific personality traits. The environment and external factors can also heavily influence the expression of these traits.\nThe influence of genetics on personality traits can be explained through twin studies and family studies. Identical twins, who share 100% of their genetic makeup, tend to have more similar personality traits compared to fraternal twins, who share only 50% of their genetic makeup. Similarly, adopted children often exhibit personality traits that are more similar to their biological parents than their adoptive parents.", "It is important to note that genetics alone do not dictate our development.

For example, eye color, height, and certain medical conditions can be passed down from parents to their children. However, it is important to recognize that not all traits are solely determined by genetics. Environmental factors can also influence the expression of certain genes.", "In conclusion, intelligence is influenced by both genetic inheritance and environmental factors. The nature versus nurture debate has shifted towards understanding the complex interplay between genes and the environment in shaping cognitive abilities. It is clear that both inheritance and the environment contribute to the development of intelligence, and future research should focus on unraveling the intricacies of their combined influence.\nPersonality Traits and Genetic Predisposition\nGenetics has always played a significant role in the nature vs nurture debate. While the debate focuses on the relative influences of genes and environment on human development, it is widely accepted that both factors contribute to the formation of personality traits.", "One of the most intriguing debates in the field of psychology is the nature vs nurture debate. This debate centers around the question of how much of an individual\u2019s development and traits are influenced by genetics (nature) and how much is influenced by the environment and experience (nurture).\nGenetics play a significant role in the inheritance of traits and characteristics. Certain physical and mental traits can be directly attributed to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. For example, eye color, height, and even certain disease predispositions can be linked to specific genes. This suggests that nature plays a prominent role in shaping who we are.", "It is crucial to understand that while genes may provide a foundation for certain personality traits, nurture plays a significant role in their development.

While genetics provide a foundation, environmental influences play a significant role in shaping an individual\u2019s personality traits. The ongoing debate surrounding the relative contributions of nature and nurture to the development of personality traits will likely continue as researchers delve deeper into the complexities of human behavior.\nMental Disorders: Genetic and Environmental Influence", "Mental disorders are complex conditions that arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The inheritance and development of these disorders have been at the center of the genetics versus nurture debate. While genetics play a significant role in the predisposition to mental disorders, environmental factors also have a profound influence.\nGenetics and Mental Disorders\nResearch has shown that genetics contribute to the development of mental disorders. Certain genes can increase the risk of developing specific disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. These genetic factors can affect the structure and function of the brain, leading to an increased vulnerability to mental illnesses.\nThe identification of specific genes associated with mental disorders has provided valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted treatments and interventions.", "For decades, the debate between nature and nurture has captivated scientists, psychologists, and scholars alike. The question at the heart of this debate is: to what extent are our traits and development determined by our genetics, and to what extent are they shaped by our environment? Are we born with certain innate qualities, or do we acquire them through the experiences and influences we encounter in life?\nOn one side of the debate, proponents of the nature theory argue that our traits and behaviors are primarily determined by our genetic makeup. They believe that factors such as intelligence, personality, and even certain diseases are largely inherited from our parents and ancestors. According to this perspective, our genetic inheritance is a powerful force that shapes who we are and how we develop.", "On the other side, proponents of the nurture theory contend that our environment plays a more significant role in determining our traits and development. They believe that factors such as upbringing, social interactions, and cultural influences heavily influence who we become. This perspective suggests that our genes may provide a blueprint, but it is our environment that ultimately determines how that blueprint is expressed.\nBoth sides of the debate present compelling arguments, and the reality is likely a complex interplay between genetics and environment. The truth is that our traits and development are influenced by a combination of our genetic inheritance and the experiences and influences we encounter throughout our lives. Understanding the precise contributions of genes and environment is a challenging task, but ongoing research in fields such as genetics, psychology, and neuroscience is helping to unravel this intricate puzzle.\nDefinition of Nature vs Nurture", "Adoption studies, on the other hand, allow researchers to examine the impact of shared environments versus genetic similarities. By comparing adopted children to their adoptive and biological parents, researchers can determine to what extent genetics and environment contribute to various traits. If adopted children display more similarities with their biological parents in a specific trait, it suggests a genetic influence.\nBoth twin studies and adoption studies have provided valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetics and environment. They have shown that while genetics certainly play a role in the development of certain traits, environmental factors also have a significant influence. The debate of nature versus nurture has thus evolved into an understanding that both genetics and environment interact and contribute to human development.\nBehavior Genetics", "Respecting Individual Autonomy\nOne ethical consideration in the nature vs nurture debate is the need to respect individual autonomy. Many aspects of our genetic makeup, such as inherited diseases, can have significant impacts on an individual\u2019s well-being. It is crucial to consider how genetics can influence a person\u2019s choices and decision-making, while ensuring that they have the freedom to live their life free from discrimination or stigmatization based on their genetic inheritance.\nAvoiding Determinism", "One practical implication is in the field of education. Recognizing that both genes and environment contribute to a child\u2019s development, educators can design educational programs that address the unique needs and strengths of each individual. By considering the genetic makeup of a student, teachers can tailor their teaching methods to optimize learning outcomes.\nIn the field of healthcare, understanding the influence of genes and environment is crucial for personalized medicine. Genetic factors can inform medical professionals about an individual\u2019s susceptibility to certain diseases or adverse reactions to medications. By taking into account an individual\u2019s genetic makeup and environmental factors, healthcare providers can develop personalized treatment plans that are more effective and tailored to the specific needs of each patient.", "Heritability is a term used to describe the proportion of variability in a trait that is due to genetics. It is often represented as a percentage, with higher percentages indicating that the trait is more influenced by genetics, and lower percentages indicating that the trait is more influenced by the environment.\nGenetic variation refers to the differences that exist between individuals within a population due to their genetic makeup. This genetic variation is what allows for the diversity of traits and abilities that we observe in the world around us.\nUnderstanding Heritability\nHeritability is a complex concept that requires careful interpretation. It is important to note that heritability does not tell us anything about the role of genetics in an individual case, but rather provides an estimate of the contribution of genetics to the observed variation in a trait within a specific population at a specific point in time.", "The debate of nature versus nurture when it comes to the influence of genetics and environment on human development and traits has been the subject of extensive research. Twin studies and adoption studies have played a crucial role in unraveling the contributions of genetics and inheritance versus environmental factors.\nTwin studies have been particularly helpful in determining the heritability of various traits. Identical twins share 100% of their genetic material, while fraternal twins share approximately 50%. By comparing the similarities between these two types of twins, researchers can estimate the relative contributions of genes and environment. If identical twins are more similar in a specific trait than fraternal twins, it suggests that genetics play a significant role in that trait\u2019s development.", "In the influential debate surrounding the genetics versus nurture argument, several key players have contributed to the ongoing discussion on the importance of genetic traits and environmental factors in shaping an individual\u2019s development.\nGenetics, as a field of study, focuses on the inheritable characteristics that are passed down from one generation to another. Advocates of the genetics perspective argue that traits, such as intelligence, personality, and physical features, are heavily influenced by one\u2019s genetic makeup. They believe that certain genes contribute to the predisposition of certain behaviors and tendencies.", "Advocates of the nature stance argue that genetics play a dominant role in determining an individual\u2019s traits and behavior. They emphasize the influence of inherited genes in shaping characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and certain medical conditions.\nThe Nurture Argument\nOn the other hand, proponents of the nurture perspective assert that the environment plays a crucial role in human development. They believe that experiences, upbringing, and social interactions have a significant impact on a person\u2019s nature and behavior.\nOverall, the nature versus nurture debate remains a complex and ongoing discussion in genetics and human development. While the influence of genetics is undeniable, the role of the environment cannot be disregarded. Understanding the interplay between these factors is essential for unraveling the complexities of human inheritance and development.\nKey Players in the Debate", "Behavior genetics research is interdisciplinary, drawing upon genetics, psychology, neuroscience, and other fields to unravel the complex interplay between nature and nurture. By continuing to explore this fascinating area of study, behavior genetics researchers contribute to our understanding of human development and inform debates about the relative importance of genetics and environment in shaping our traits and behaviors.\nHeritability and Genetic Variation\nThe genetics vs. environment debate has long been a topic of discussion in the field of behavioral genetics. This debate revolves around the question of how much of our traits, abilities, and behaviors are influenced by genetics and how much is influenced by the environment in which we are raised.", "One future direction is to delve deeper into the genetics of complex traits. While certain genetic factors have been identified for a range of traits, such as intelligence or personality, many of these traits are influenced by a large number of genes, each contributing only a small effect. Identifying and understanding the specific genetic variants involved in complex traits presents a significant challenge, but it holds the promise of shedding light on the interplay between genetics, nature, and nurture.\n2. Investigating Gene-Environment Interactions", "One of the key components in the nature vs nurture debate is the role of genetics and inherited traits in human development. Genetics refers to the study of how traits are passed down from one generation to the next through DNA, while inherited traits are characteristics that are determined by our genes.\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the influence of genetics on human development centers around the question of how much of who we are is determined by our genetic makeup versus our environment. Some argue that genetics play a major role in shaping our traits and abilities, while others believe that the environment we are exposed to has a more significant impact.", "In the long-standing nature versus nurture debate, cultural and societal factors play a significant role in human development and the expression of inherited traits. While genetics and inheritance determine the basic blueprint of an individual, the environment and social context in which they are raised shape their behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes.\nImpact of Culture\nCulture refers to the shared values, customs, beliefs, and practices that exist within a particular society or group. Cultural factors greatly influence an individual\u2019s development and behavior. For example, language, religion, and social norms vary across cultures and can significantly affect how a person perceives and interacts with the world.", "Genetics plays a significant role in determining intelligence. Studies have shown that genetic factors contribute to variations in intelligence among individuals. However, environmental factors such as education and socio-economic status also play a significant role in shaping intellectual abilities.\nIs it possible for the influence of genes and environment to vary between different traits?\nYes, the influence of genes and environment can vary between different traits. Some traits may be more strongly influenced by genetic factors, while others may be more sensitive to environmental influences. The specific interaction between genes and environment can differ depending on the trait being studied.", "Another influential experiment was conducted by Thomas Bouchard in the 1970s. He studied pairs of identical twins who had been separated at birth and raised in different environments. Despite their different upbringings, the twins showed striking similarities in their intelligence, personality traits, and even physical appearance. This experiment demonstrated the strong influence of genetics on development, challenging the notion that environment is the primary factor in shaping individuals.\nThe Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MISTRA) is another famous study that contributed to the nature vs nurture debate. The study examined the lives of twins raised apart and found that they often exhibited similar interests, careers, and habits, suggesting a genetic influence on these traits. However, the study also revealed the significant impact of the environment, as twins raised in different families had distinct experiences and values.", "The Impact of Environment and Nurture\nWhile genetics may provide the blueprint, it is the environment that shapes the final outcome. The environment, including the family, school, and society, plays a crucial role in an individual\u2019s development. Nurture affects how we learn, communicate, and understand the world around us.\nFor example, children raised in a supportive and stimulating environment tend to have better cognitive and social skills compared to those raised in impoverished or neglectful environments. The impact of environment extends beyond childhood and into adulthood, as experiences throughout life continue to shape and mold our behaviors and attitudes.\nA comprehensive understanding of human behavior and development requires acknowledging the intertwined nature of genetics and environment. It is not a matter of nature versus nurture, but rather the complex interaction between the two that ultimately shapes who we are.", "The environment, which includes both external factors such as diet and lifestyle choices, as well as internal factors such as stress and hormones, can impact gene expression through epigenetic modifications. For example, studies have shown that certain environmental exposures, such as exposure to toxins or chemicals, can lead to changes in DNA methylation patterns, resulting in altered gene expression and increased risk of certain diseases.\nMoreover, research has also demonstrated that the environment can have a lasting impact across multiple generations through epigenetic inheritance. Studies in mice have shown that exposure to certain environmental factors, such as poor nutrition or stress, can lead to changes in gene expression that are passed down to subsequent generations. This suggests that the environment can play a critical role in shaping genetic inheritance and potentially contribute to the nature vs. nurture debate.\nGene-Environment Interaction", "Evidence from Twin Studies\nOne way to explore the influence of genetics and the environment is through twin studies. By comparing the traits and behaviors of identical twins who share almost identical genetic profiles, researchers can assess the impact of external factors on their development. Twin studies have shown that even with the same genetic makeup, twins may exhibit variations in behavior, intelligence, and physical attributes due to differences in their environment and experiences.\nIn conclusion, while genetics undoubtedly play a crucial role in an individual\u2019s makeup, the environment and external factors exert significant influence on their development and traits. The debate between nature and nurture prompts us to recognize the intertwined relationship between genetics and the environment, forming the foundation for a better understanding of how individuals are shaped and molded.\nTwin Studies and Adoption Studies", "For example, if a trait has a heritability of 60%, it means that 60% of the observed variation in that trait within a specific population at a specific point in time is due to genetic factors. The remaining 40% is due to environmental factors.\nThe Influence of Genetics and Environment\nThe influence of genetics and environment on traits and abilities is not an either-or scenario, but rather a complex interaction between the two. While genetics provide the foundation for our traits and abilities, the environment plays a crucial role in shaping their expression and development.\nGenetic factors set the boundaries and potential for development, while environmental factors, such as upbringing, education, and social interactions, contribute to the actual expression of these genetic potentials. This interaction between genetics and environment is often referred to as gene-environment interaction.", "The debate between nature and nurture focuses on the relative contributions of genetics and environment in shaping individual traits and characteristics. While genetics play a significant role in inheritance, it is increasingly recognized that the environment can have a profound influence on gene expression and subsequent outcomes.\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes to the underlying DNA sequence. It encompasses modifications to the structure of DNA, such as methylation, as well as modifications to the proteins associated with DNA. These epigenetic changes can influence how genes are turned on or off, ultimately affecting the traits and behaviors that are inherited.\nInfluence of the Environment", "The debate over the influence of nature and nurture in education is an ongoing discussion that explores the role of genetics and environment in shaping a student\u2019s development and learning abilities. While genetics play a significant role in determining certain traits, such as intelligence or learning disorders, the environment also plays a crucial part in a student\u2019s educational journey.\nInfluence of Environment\nThe environment in which a student grows up can have a profound impact on their educational outcomes. Factors such as socio-economic status, access to quality education, family dynamics, and cultural influences all shape a student\u2019s educational experience. Students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds may face numerous challenges that can hinder their academic success. In contrast, students who grow up in a nurturing and stimulating environment may be more likely to thrive academically.", "It is important to note that cultural and societal factors are not mutually exclusive from genetics. In fact, they often interact and influence each other. For example, a person\u2019s genetic predisposition for certain traits, such as intelligence or temperament, may be expressed differently based on the cultural context in which they are raised. Similarly, societal structures and norms can also evolve and change based on genetic and biological research.\nIn conclusion, the nature versus nurture debate cannot be simplified to a binary argument. Cultural and societal factors play a crucial role in human development and behavior, working hand in hand with genetics and inheritance to shape the complexity of the human experience.\nNature vs Nurture in Education", "An important ethical concern in the nature vs nurture debate is the risk of determinism. If we were to believe that genetics alone determines our traits and behavior, it could lead to a deterministic view that individuals have no control over their lives. This could have serious consequences for personal responsibility, accountability, and social justice. It is essential to strike a balance that acknowledges the influence of genetics while recognizing the role of environmental factors in shaping who we are.\nNature, through genetics, and nurture, through environmental influences, both play a significant role in human development. The ethical considerations in this debate require us to carefully navigate the complexities and ensure the protection of individual rights and autonomy while avoiding deterministic views that negate personal agency and accountability.\nCurrent Research and Advances", "One striking example of cultural influence is language acquisition. Human beings have a natural ability to acquire language, but the specific language(s) they learn is determined by the culture in which they are raised. Children who grow up in bilingual or multilingual environments will naturally learn and become fluent in multiple languages.\nSocietal Expectations\nSocietal expectations and norms also shape an individual\u2019s development, choices, and self-perception. From an early age, children are exposed to society\u2019s implicit and explicit expectations about gender roles, career choices, and even body image. These societal messages can have a profound impact on a person\u2019s self-esteem, identity, and overall well-being.\nFor example, in some societies, there may be pressure for males to be stoic and emotionally reserved, while females may be expected to be nurturing and expressive. These societal expectations can influence an individual\u2019s behavior and personality traits.", "However, it is equally important to recognize that the environment also has a significant impact on an individual\u2019s development. Various environmental factors, such as upbringing, social interactions, and exposure to different stimuli, can shape an individual\u2019s behaviors and traits. Research has highlighted the importance of a nurturing and stimulating environment for optimal development.\nAdvances in technology, such as genetic sequencing and genome editing, have revolutionized the field of genetics research. These tools allow scientists to study the intricate details of an individual\u2019s genetic makeup and make targeted modifications to specific genes. This has opened up new possibilities for personalized medicine and the treatment of genetic disorders.", "Genetics can also influence a student\u2019s susceptibility to certain learning disorders or disabilities. Conditions such as dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a genetic component that can impact a student\u2019s ability to process information or concentrate in a traditional classroom setting. Recognizing and addressing these genetic factors can ensure appropriate support and accommodations for students in need.\nIn conclusion, the nature vs nurture debate in education highlights the intertwined influence of genetics and environment on a student\u2019s development and educational outcomes. While genetics contribute to certain traits and tendencies, the environment can shape a student\u2019s educational experience and provide opportunities for growth. Understanding and leveraging both nature and nurture can help educators create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students.\nNature vs Nurture in Criminal Behavior", "The interaction between genes and the environment further complicates the intelligence debate. It is now widely accepted that genes and the environment interact and influence each other in a dynamic manner. This interaction can result in gene-environment correlations, where genetic predispositions may lead individuals to seek out certain environments that are congruent with their genetic makeup. Additionally, gene-environment interactions can occur, where genetic factors may only have an impact on intelligence when exposed to specific environmental conditions.", "These case studies and experiments highlight the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping an individual\u2019s development. While genetics play a significant role in determining certain traits, such as intelligence and personality, the environment also has a substantial influence on an individual\u2019s growth and behavior. The nature vs nurture debate continues to be an ongoing topic of interest, as scientists strive to understand the intricate relationship between genetics and environment.\nPractical Implications and Applications\nThe influence of genes and environment on the development of traits has long been a subject of debate. While some argue that traits are solely determined by genetic inheritance (nature), others believe that the environment in which individuals are raised (nurture) plays a significant role. Understanding this complex interplay between nature and nurture has important practical implications and applications in various fields.", "The genetics vs. environment debate is not a matter of one side being right and the other being wrong, but rather a matter of understanding the intricate interplay between genetics and environment in shaping our traits, abilities, and behaviors.\nExploring Genetic Variation\nGenetic variation is a fundamental concept in the study of genetics. It refers to the differences in genetic make-up that exist between individuals within a population. These differences can range from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA sequences to larger structural variations, such as gene duplications or deletions.\nGenetic variation is important because it is the raw material on which natural selection acts. It allows for the adaptation and evolution of species over time. Without genetic variation, there would be no diversity of traits and abilities, and populations would be more susceptible to diseases and other challenges.\nEpigenetics and Gene-Environment Interaction", "The interaction between genes and the environment is complex and multifaceted. While genetics may predispose individuals to certain traits or behaviors, it is the interaction between genes and the environment that ultimately determines whether these traits or behaviors are expressed. This gene-environment interaction can vary depending on factors such as timing, duration, and intensity of environmental exposures.\nUnderstanding the interplay between genetics and environment is crucial in unraveling the complexities of human development and behavior. It highlights the need for a holistic approach in studying nature and nurture, recognizing that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the traits and characteristics that make each individual unique.\nNature vs Nurture in Psychology", "Understanding the influence of genetics and environment on criminal behavior can help inform prevention and intervention efforts. By identifying individuals who may be at a higher risk based on genetic factors or adverse environmental circumstances, targeted interventions can be implemented to mitigate the development of criminal tendencies.\nOverall, the nature vs nurture debate in criminal behavior highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that takes into account both genetic and environmental factors. Recognizing the interconnectedness of nature and nurture is crucial in developing effective strategies to reduce crime and promote positive social outcomes.\nEthics in the Nature vs Nurture Debate\nThe ongoing debate about the influence of genetics and environment on human development has raised important ethical concerns. The question of whether nature or nurture is more influential in shaping an individual\u2019s traits and behavior has far-reaching implications for society.", "Furthermore, the emerging field of epigenetics has shed light on the complex interplay between genes and the environment. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can influence gene expression and ultimately affect an individual\u2019s development. Researchers are now exploring how these epigenetic changes can be influenced by environmental factors and how they contribute to the nature vs nurture debate.\nIn conclusion, the genetics nature vs nurture debate continues to be a topic of great interest and importance in the scientific community. Through current research and advances in genetics, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between genes and the environment. This knowledge has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human development and pave the way for personalized medicine and targeted treatments.\nBiases and Controversies", "Controversies arise when attempting to unravel the complex interactions between genetics and environment. Some argue that certain traits are predominantly influenced by genetics, while others believe that environmental factors play a more significant role.\nAdditionally, biases can emerge from cultural and societal norms. Assumptions about gender, race, and socio-economic status may impact how researchers interpret and study the influence of genetics and environment on traits.\nIt is crucial to approach the genetics nature vs. nurture debate with an open mind and to consider the interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Both genetics and environment play vital roles in shaping who we are, and it is the combination of these factors that ultimately determines our traits and development.\nCase Studies and Famous Experiments", "External factors, such as upbringing, education, social interactions, and cultural influences, profoundly impact an individual\u2019s development and behavior. These factors can override or modify the genetic predispositions, leading to variations in traits and abilities that may not align with the individual\u2019s genetic profile.\nInteraction between Nature and Nurture\nThe interaction between genetics and the environment is complex and multifaceted. While genetics provide the foundation for an individual\u2019s inherent traits, the environment can either enhance or limit the expression of these genetic characteristics. This interaction is often referred to as gene-environment interaction.\nThe debate between nature and nurture is not a matter of one factor being more dominant than the other, but rather an understanding of their intertwined influence. Both genetics and the environment work in conjunction to shape an individual\u2019s attributes and determine their overall development.", "However, the influence of the environment and nurture on human development cannot be overlooked. Environmental factors such as parenting style, social interactions, and cultural norms can greatly impact an individual\u2019s personality, behavior, and overall well-being. Studies have shown that siblings raised in the same household can have vastly different personalities and outcomes in life, further highlighting the role of nurture.\nGenetics and Inheritance\nGenetics provide the foundation for our physical and cognitive attributes. It is through our genes that we inherit specific traits and characteristics from our parents. The study of genetics has helped scientists uncover the underlying factors behind various diseases and disorders.\nResearch in the field of behavioral genetics aims to understand how genetics influence human behavior. Twin studies and adoption studies have been conducted to determine the extent to which genetics contribute to personality and intelligence.", "Another key future direction is to investigate the intricate interplay between genes and the environment. Researchers need to explore how specific genetic variations interact with environmental factors to influence an individual\u2019s development and traits. This will require large-scale studies and advanced statistical methods to account for the complexity of these interactions. Understanding gene-environment interactions will provide crucial insights into the relative contributions of genetics and the environment in shaping human traits.\nTo tackle these future directions and challenges, collaboration between geneticists, psychologists, and other relevant disciplines will be essential. Furthermore, advances in technology, particularly in genomics and data analysis, will play a crucial role in unlocking the mysteries of genetics\u2019 nature versus nurture debate.\nReferences", "The nature vs nurture debate is a long-standing discussion in the field of genetics and human development.

These include traits that are passed down from parents, such as eye color, height, and potential health risks.\nThe concept of nurture, on the other hand, refers to the influence of the environment in which an individual is raised. This includes factors such as parenting style, education, socioeconomic status, and cultural influences. These external factors can greatly impact an individual\u2019s behavior, personality, and cognitive abilities.", "When considering the influence of genetics and environment on traits and development, biases and controversies emerge. The genetics vs. nurture debate has sparked heated discussions and conflicting opinions among experts in the field.\nOne major bias is the assumption that genetics alone determine an individual\u2019s traits and characteristics. This perspective, known as the \u201cnature\u201d view, emphasizes the role of genetic inheritance in shaping who we are. However, this viewpoint neglects the significant impact of environmental factors on our development.\nOn the other hand, the \u201cnurture\u201d view rejects the notion that genes are the sole influencers and highlights the importance of environmental factors. This perspective suggests that our upbringing, experiences, and social surroundings have a profound impact on shaping our traits and behaviors.", "One of the most famous case studies in the nature vs nurture debate is the story of the Jim twins. Jim Springer and Jim Lewis were identical twins who were separated at birth and reunited at age 39. Despite being raised in different environments, they had remarkable similarities in their lives. Both Jims named their children the same names, married women with the same first name, drove the same car, and even vacationed at the same beach. This case study provided strong evidence for the role of genetics in shaping traits and behaviors.", "Researchers in behavior genetics study a wide range of traits and behaviors, including personality, intelligence, mental health disorders, and addiction. By examining both genetic and environmental factors, they can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how these complex interactions shape individual differences.\nBehavior genetics research has shown that genetic factors can influence traits and behaviors, but the influence of the environment is equally important. For example, certain genetic variants may increase the risk for developing a mental health disorder, but the expression of that risk can be modified by environmental factors such as early life experiences or exposure to stress.", "The debate surrounding the influence of nature and nurture on criminal behavior has been a topic of great interest and controversy in the field of genetics. The nature perspective emphasizes the role of genetics and biological factors in the development of criminal tendencies, while the nurture perspective focuses on the influence of the environment and experiences.\nFrom a genetic standpoint, researchers have explored the inheritance of criminal behavior and the potential impact of specific genes. Studies have identified certain genetic variations that may contribute to an individual\u2019s predisposition to engage in criminal activities. These genetic factors can influence traits such as impulsivity, aggression, and risk-taking behavior, which are commonly associated with criminal behavior.", "In summary, the genetics nature vs nurture debate has practical implications and applications in various fields. Recognizing the influence of genes and environment on traits and development can lead to more tailored and effective approaches in education, healthcare, psychology, and criminology.
