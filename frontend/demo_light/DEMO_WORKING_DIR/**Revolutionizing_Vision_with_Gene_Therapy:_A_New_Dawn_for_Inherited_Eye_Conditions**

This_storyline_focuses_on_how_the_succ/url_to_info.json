A patient and family with a genetic diagnosis are in a better position to understand which emerging treatment approaches and clinical trials are most appropriate for them.\nTreatments\nIn December 2017, the biotech Spark Therapeutics obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for LUXTURNA\u2122, an RPE65 gene therapy that has improved vision in children and young adults with RPE65 mutations. Early funding from the Foundation helped make this treatment possible. Treatments for forms of LCA caused by other mutated genes are in the development pipeline.\nResearch and Clinical Trials\nFor the latest research advances for LCA, refer to the Foundation publication: Leber Congenital Amaurosis: Research Advances.\nView a list of current clinical trials, many made possible by Foundation support.\nLCA page at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.\nNext Section\nRead the Most Recent Research on Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)"], "title": "What is Leber Congenital Amaurosis? | Foundation Fighting Blindness"}, "https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/may/gene-editing-improves-sight-in-children-treated-for-blindness": {"url": "https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/may/gene-editing-improves-sight-in-children-treated-for-blindness", "description": "PHILADELPHIA\u2014CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was found to be safe and largely effective in addressing a form of inherited blindness in a group of patients that, for the first time, included children.In a multi-site clinical trial called BRILLIANCE that included researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), 14 ...", "snippets": ["\u201cOur patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their ability to see things like daylight.
