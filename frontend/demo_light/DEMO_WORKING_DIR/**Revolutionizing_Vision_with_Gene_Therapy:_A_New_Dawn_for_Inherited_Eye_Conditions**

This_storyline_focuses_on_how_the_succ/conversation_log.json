This trial demonstrated significant improvements in vision for patients with this rare inherited disease, with some patients experiencing a 100 times better vision and others even seeing a 10,000-fold improvement after receiving the highest dose of the therapy. The therapy was developed by scientists at the University of Florida and has shown promising results in restoring useful vision for most patients with LCA1.\n\nThe principles behind this therapeutic approach involve addressing the genetic mutation that causes LCA1 through gene therapy. This involves delivering a healthy copy of the mutated gene to the patient's retina, allowing for the production of a functional protein that can restore vision. This approach has shown to be successful in treating other genetic disorders as well, showcasing the potential of gene therapy to revolutionize treatments for inherited conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that this trial is still in its early stages and further research and clinical trials are needed before this therapy can become widely available. However, the success of this trial could have far-reaching implications, not just in ophthalmology, but in other fields of medicine as well. It highlights the potential of gene therapy to address genetic diseases and improve the quality of life for patients globally.\n\nMoreover, this trial also raises important discussions on the ethical considerations of gene therapy, such as its cost implications and the impact it could have on healthcare systems. As this treatment becomes more widely available, it is crucial to consider how it will be accessible and affordable for patients, especially those from lower-income backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the gene therapy trial for LCA1 has shown promising results in improving the vision of patients with this rare inherited disease.", "user_utterance": "Could you please provide a brief overview of how the gene therapy trial for LCA1 was conducted and the principles behind its therapeutic approach?", "search_queries": ["Overview of gene therapy trial for LCA1", "How was the gene therapy trial for LCA1 conducted?", "What are the principles behind the therapeutic approach used in the gene therapy trial for LCA1?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.ophthalmologytimes.com/view/study-100x-improvement-in-sight-detected-after-gene-therapy-trial", "description": "The vision of patients diagnosed with a rare inherited condition that causes them to lose much of their sight early in their childhood was demonstrated to be 100 times better after they received gene therapy to address the genetic mutation causing it..

The RPE65 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme (a protein that facilitates chemical reactions) that is essential for normal vision. Mutations in the RPE65 gene lead to reduced or absent levels of RPE65 activity, blocking the visual cycle and resulting in impaired vision. Individuals with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy experience progressive deterioration of vision over time. This loss of vision, often during childhood or adolescence, ultimately progresses to complete blindness.", "Luxturna should be given only to patients who have viable retinal cells as determined by the treating physician(s).

Around 43 million of those people are living with blindness. While not every form of blindness can be cured, recent scientific breakthroughs have uncovered new ways to treat some forms of inherited blindness through gene therapy.\nJean Bennett is a gene therapy expert and a professor emeritus of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania.

As drug manufacturers are able to refine this technique, gene therapy drugs may become more commonplace, causing their price to drop as a result.", "In March, Bennett spoke at the 2023 Imagine Solutions Conference in Naples, Florida, about what gene therapy is, why it matters and the success she and her team have had helping the blind to see. The Conversation caught up with Bennett after the conference. Her edited answers are below.\nWhat is gene therapy and how does it work?\nGene therapy is a set of techniques that harness DNA or RNA to treat or prevent disease. Gene therapy treats disease in three primary ways: by substituting a disease-causing gene with a healthy new or modified copy of that gene; turning genes on or off; and injecting a new or modified gene into the body.\nHow has gene therapy changed how doctors treat genetic eye diseases and blindness?", "What are the biggest challenges gene therapy faces?\nThe biggest challenges involve systemic diseases, or diseases affecting the entire body rather than a single organ or body part. For those diseases, super-high doses of gene therapy reagents must be delivered. Such diseases involve not only technical challenges \u2013 such as how to manufacture enormous amounts of gene therapy compounds without contaminating them \u2013 but also difficulties ensuring that the treatment targets diseased tissues without causing toxic immune side effects. That level of a problem does not exist with the eye, where relatively small doses are used and exposure to the rest of the body is limited.\nAnother challenge is how to address diseases in which the target gene is very large. Current approaches to delivering treatments into cells lack the capacity to hold large genes.", "The majority of those therapies target different forms of cancer, although there are several for devastating inherited diseases. The drug Skysona is a new injectable gene therapy medication that treats boys ages 4 to 17 with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, a genetic disease in which a buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the brain can lead to death.\nThe gene therapy that my team and I developed was the first FDA-approved project involving injection of a gene therapy directly into a person \u2013 in this case, into the retina. Only one other FDA-approved gene therapy is directly administered to the body \u2013 one that targets spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that causes progressive muscle weakness and eventually death. The drug, Zolgensma, is injected intravenously into babies and children diagnosed with the disease, allowing them to live as healthy, active children.", "In the past, many doctors did not think it necessary to identify the genetic basis of eye disease because treatment was not yet available. However, a few specialists, including me and my collaborators, identified these defects in our research, convinced that someday treatment would be made possible. Over time, we were able to create a treatment designed for individuals with particular gene defects that lead to congenital blindness.\nThis development of gene therapy for inherited disease has inspired other groups around the world to initiate clinical trials targeting other genetic forms of blindness, such as choroideremia, achromatopsia, retinitis pigmentosa and even age-related macular degeneration, all of which lead to vision loss. There are at least 40 clinical trials enrolling patients with other genetic forms of blinding disease.\nGene therapy treatments are now available in pharmacies and operating rooms all over the world."], "title": "Gene therapy helps combat some forms of blindness \u2013 and ongoing ..."}, {"url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24167-lebers-congenital-amaurosis", "description": "Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare condition that affects the retinas in babies\u2019 eyes.

LCA disease pathway 1 involves molecules necessary for the phototransduction cascade, and includes the following genes: GYCY2D, AIPL1, and RD3. Disease pathway 2 is in the retinoid cycle and includes the RPE65, LRAT, and RDH12 genes. Disease pathway 3 includes the retinal transcription factor, which includes CRX. Disease pathway 4 involves intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and includes mutations in SPATA7, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CEP290, TULP1, NPHP5, CLUAP1, and IFT140. CRB1 and PRPH2 are included in disease pathway 5, which is involved in photoreceptor morphogenesis. Disease pathway 6 is in metabolic enzymes for cellular survival and includes IMPDH1 and NMNAT1. Finally, disease pathway 7 is in photoreceptor ion channels and is represented by mutations in KCNJ13.\nLCA classification based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning.

It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children.\nCauses\nLeber congenital amaurosis can result from variants (also known as mutations) in at least 20 genes, all of which are necessary for function of the retina and normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are found in the retina's photoreceptors and are necessary for vision.", "Variants in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Variants in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of Leber congenital amaurosis, while variants in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown, though research is ongoing.\nInheritance\nLeber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry only one copy of the altered gene, and therefore they typically do not show any signs and symptoms of the disease.", "A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of affected individuals poking, pressing, and rubbing their eyes with a knuckle or finger. Poking their eyes often results in the sensation of flashes of light called phosphenes. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes in affected children.\nIn very rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. Because of the visual loss, affected children may become isolated. Providing children with opportunities to play, hear, touch, understand and other early educational interventions may prevent developmental delays in children with Leber congenital amaurosis.\nAt least 20 genetic types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities.", "Description\nLeber congenital amaurosis, also known as LCA, is an eye disorder that is present from birth (congenital). This condition primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning at birth or shortly afterward. The visual impairment tends to be severe and may worsen over time.\nLeber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light.

Glasses provide limited benefit to these patients because they correct abnormalities in the optical focusing ability of the eye, and are unable to address medical causes of vision loss, such as genetic retinal diseases like LCA1.", "The trial tested different dosage levels of the gene therapy, ATSN-101, which was adapted from the AAV5 microorganism and was surgically injected under the retina. For the first part of the study, cohorts of three adults each received one of the three different dosages: Low, mid, and high. Evaluations were held between each level of dosage to ensure that they were safe before upping the dosage for the next cohort. A second phase of the study involved only administering the high dosage levels to both an adult cohort of three and a pediatric cohort of three, again after safety reviews of the previous cohorts.", "Improvements were noticed quickly, often within the first month, after the therapy was applied and lasted for at least 12 months. Observations of participating patients are also ongoing. Three of six high-dosage patients who were tested to navigate a mobility course in varying levels of light achieved the maximum-possible score. Other tests used eye charts or measured the dimmest flashes of light patients perceived in a dark environment.\nOf the nine patients who received the maximum dosage, two had the 10,000-fold improvement in vision.\n\u201cEven though we previously predicted a large vision improvement potential in LCA1, we did not know how receptive patients\u2019 photoreceptors would be to treatment after decades of blindness,\u201d said Cideciyan. \u201cIt is very satisfying to see a successful multi-center trial that shows gene therapy can be dramatically efficacious.\u201d", "Primarily, the study sought to determine the safety of the gene therapy and its varying dosage levels. Researchers did find some patients had side effects, but the overwhelming majority were related to the surgical procedure itself. The most common side effect was conjunctival hemorrhage, the breakage of small blood vessels underneath the clear surface of the eye, which healed. Two patients had eye inflammation that was reversed with a course of steroids. No serious side effects were related to the study drug.", "This work comes on the heels of another successful ophthalmological trial at Penn restoring sight in patients with a different form of LCA.

This gene is responsible for producing a protein that is essential for the proper functioning of photoreceptors in the retina. In individuals with LCA1, mutations in this gene lead to a deficiency in the protein, causing severe vision loss.\n\nThe treatment for LCA1 using gene therapy involves delivering a normal copy of the RPE65 gene into the cells of the retina. This can be achieved through a viral vector, which is a harmless virus that is modified to carry the normal gene. Once the virus enters the cells of the retina, it releases the normal gene, which can then start producing the protein necessary for proper vision.\n\nThe success of this gene therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania has shown remarkable improvements in vision for patients with LCA1. Patients have reported being able to see stars, snowflakes, and navigate their surroundings at night for the first time. This is due to the significant increase in light sensitivity and improvement in visual acuity, which can be up to 10,000 times better after the treatment.\n\nFurthermore, this gene therapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of other inherited eye conditions, as it showcases the power of genetic medicine to address genetic mutations and their associated diseases. This has far-reaching implications beyond ophthalmology and can impact healthcare systems and quality of life for patients globally.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that LCA1 is just one of the many types of LCA, each caused by a different genetic mutation. Therefore, this gene therapy may not be effective for all types of LCA.

Note that the colobomatous-like maculopathy seen with NMNAT1 (LCA9) mutations is possibly due to a congenital lack of foveal formation and inner retinal layers. All 3 mutations show a reduced central ONL. The parafoveal retinal thickness varies in AIPL1 (LCA4) and RDH12 (LCA13) patients but is significantly thinned in NMNAT1 (LCA9).1\nLCA classification based on retinal histopathology findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning. Monitoring and treating possible clinical associations, such as renal failure and hearing loss, is primordial to maximize patients\u2019 quality of life.", "There have been significant advances in therapeutic modalities, including gene replacement, stem cell therapy, and pharmacologic therapies in a number of inherited retinal diseases. Gene replacement therapy using subretinal injection of genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown very promising results in several LCA animal models and humans: GUCY2D RetGC1 mouse models,111-113 RPE65 Briard dogs,114 and mouse models20,115-118 as well as AIPL1 knock-out mouse models,119 AAV-based gene replacement was shown to preserve and rescue photoreceptors (both rods and cones) and improve and restore retinal function. Based on this success, human clinical trials for LCA patients were undertaken globally and are at various stages of completion (Table 2).", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "Oral substitutes of key components of the visual pathway have been clinically tested and have been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and adults with RPE65 and LRAT mutations.125,126 The 2 phases I/II clinical trials using a synthetic prodrug precursor to 9-cis-retinal, QLT091001, showed both significant enlargement of the kinetic visual field and improvement in visual acuity in 44% and 67% of participants, respectively.126 A phase III trial with the same agent is being planned.\nFinally, human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) therapy holds future promise as it aims to regenerate dysfunctional RPE cells. Currently, 2 human phase I/II stem cell clinical trials have demonstrated successful RPE integration of injected hESCs.127,128 The integration and transplantation of stem cells to the photoreceptor layer, which is needed for LCA therapy, is still in the preclinical stage.\nReferences", "- Coussa RG, Lopez Solache I, Koenekoop RK.

High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases. Various phenotypes (LCA1 to LCA19) with at least 29 genotypes have been identified that account for around 70-80% of cases, with thereby more genes yet to be identified.

One-third of individuals with LCA have no perception of light. Visual acuity is, with rare exceptions, 20/400 and below. The visual impairment is generally stable or very slowly progressive. Occasionally in the early stages, a mild degree of visual improvement is observed, followed by progressive degradation. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings and ERG.

LCA1 is a rare condition that affects the retina in infants, causing severe vision loss. This is due to genetic mutations that affect how the retina develops and functions. Through gene therapy, these mutations can be fixed or replaced with healthy genes to restore the production and function of critical proteins in the retina. This has been successfully demonstrated in a recent trial at the University of Pennsylvania, where patients with LCA1 showed significant improvements in their vision.\n\nGene therapy involves altering the genetic code to recover the functions of critical proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell and are essential for the proper functioning of the body's tissues. Gene therapy aims to fix or compensate for genetic mutations that can impact the production or function of these important proteins. This can be achieved in a few different ways, such as using gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 to directly alter the genes or using viruses to deliver healthy genes into the body.\n\nThe success of gene therapy in treating LCA1 has raised hopes for its potential to tackle other genetic diseases as well. Currently, gene therapy has been approved by the FDA for certain conditions such as cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease. However, it is mostly available through clinical trials. The use of gene therapy for inherited eye conditions, specifically targeting LCA1, has the potential to revolutionize vision and pave the way for other genetic disorders to be treated in a similar manner.\n\nAside from the medical implications, gene therapy also brings up ethical considerations and cost implications for healthcare systems.

Patients usually present with nystagmus, sluggish or near-absent pupillary responses, severely decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and high hyperopia. It is the most severe retinal dystrophy causing blindness by the age of 1 year in most cases.", "The disease was first described by Theodor Karl Gustav von Leber (February 29, 1840 - April 17, 1917) in 1869. It should not be confused with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy described by the same physician in 1871. Leber also described 'Leber miliary aneurysms' now thought to be a variant of Coats disease.\nPrimary Prevention\nGenetic testing before pregnancy or prenatal testing can identify patients at risk of passing this condition on to offspring.\nEtiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases. Various phenotypes (LCA1 to LCA19) with at least 29 genotypes have been identified that account for around 70-80% of cases, with thereby more genes yet to be identified.  These genes are known to be important in several retinal developmental and physiologic pathways. Genes with known mutations are GUCY2D, RPE65, SPATA7, AIPL1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CRX, CRB1, NMNAT1, CEP290, IMPDH1, RD3, RDH12, LRAT, TULP1, KCNJ13, GDF6, CABP4, CNGA3, ALMS1, IQCB1, MYO7A. The other genes causing LCA are unknown. CEP290 (15%), GUCY2D (12%), and CRB1 (10%) and RPE65 (8%) are the most frequently mutated LCA genes.\nHistory", "German ophthalmologist, Theodor Leber, first described the dystrophy in 1869 in a blind child with wandering nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and congenital retinitis pigmentosa. In 1957, a non-recordable ERG (electroretinogram) was identified as a common feature essential to diagnosis of LCA. It was at this time that the disease was named. At the same time, a Swedish study identified the disease to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. This dystrophy is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disease affecting 1 in 30000 to 1 in 81000 subjects.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors are affected parent and/or parents who are carriers of a mutated gene responsible for one of the 17 LCA subtypes.\nGeneral Pathology\nThe histopathology showed the involvement of outer retina and photoreceptors and suggested that the LCA is a degenerative process rather than agenesis.\nPathophysiology", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "The estimated birth prevalence of LCA is two to three per 100,000 births. LCA represents almost 5% of all retinal dystrophies and 20% of children with visual impairment in special schools.\nDiagnosis\nHistory\nLCA is characterized by significant vision loss in infancy. It may be suspected in a young child with decreased visual response, nystagmus, poorly reactive pupils, and an extinguished ERG. Family history is typically consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.\nDiagnosis is clinical in this disorder, requiring thorough clinical evaluation and ophthalmic history. Diagnosis is supported by ERG and OCT (optical coherence tomography). Precise diagnosis requires molecular gene testing. Gene testing such as DNA microarray, next generation sequencing, linkage analysis and homozygosity/autozygosity mapping are used to identify specific gene mutations in LCA.", "LCA is characterized by at least three findings: severe and early visual impairment, sluggish or absent pupillary responses, and severely subnormal or non-detectible ERG.\nNo retinal lesion is diagnostic of LCA or specific for a certain subtype. Infants usually have normal fundus appearance and fundus abnormalities present later in life.\nSigns\n- Abnormal or absent pupillary response\n- Keratoconus\n- Nystagmus noticed early in life, present from birth, can be pendular or roving and is present in all positions of gaze\n- Photophobia\n- Nyctalopia\n- Vision loss (typically ranging from 20/200 to complete blindness)\n- Hyperopia is commonly found but myopia has also been reported. High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "- Non-ophthalmologic features include mental retardation and olfactory dysfunction, in addition to stereotypical movements and behaviors\nRetinal exam\n- The retina appears normal initially. Later, a variety of abnormalities may develop either in isolation or combination. They include: chorioretinal degeneration and atrophy centered around the fovea, \u201cbone-spicule\" like pigmentation, subretinal flecks, \"marbled\" fundus, pigmented nummular lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), optic disc abnormalities, and \u201cCoats like\u201d reaction.\n- Oculo-digital sign comprising eye poking, pressing, and rubbing likely producing mechanical retinal stimulation. The major sequel is enophthalmos, a physical defect in which the eye recedes into the orbit, presumably from atrophy of orbital fat. This behavior is performed to in an effort to stimulate vision.", "- Intellectual Disability: Rarely, LCA is seen in association with neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and oculomotor apraxia-type behavior.\nSymptoms\nVisual impairment\nProfound visual impairment is usually present from birth. One-third of individuals with LCA have no perception of light. Visual acuity is, with rare exceptions, 20/400 and below. The visual impairment is generally stable or very slowly progressive. Occasionally in the early stages, a mild degree of visual improvement is observed, followed by progressive degradation. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings and ERG. LCA has retinal, ocular, and extraocular features and occasionally, systemic associations. Recent evidence shows that not the genetics of LCA but the low vision can increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder. \nDiagnostic procedures", "- ERG: Nonrecordable/Extinguished or severely reduced scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) is typical in LCA. Normal ERG responses rule out a diagnosis of LCA. Visual evoked responses are variable. ERG measures electrical response of retina which are decreased or absent in LCA.\n- Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF): Autofluorescence measures lipofuscin accumulation in RPE which is related to shed photoreceptor disc elements. Amount of autofluorescence in LCA varies by subtype. For example, autofluorescence is normal in GUCY2D mutation but absent in RPE65 mutations. Abnormalities on FAF include a ring of macular hypo/hyper AF or peripheral hypo-AF. \n- OCT: OCT is high resolution cross sectional images of retinal architecture. In LCA, retinal atrophy is common. In advanced LCA, retinal arterioles are attenuated reflecting overall metabolic status of the retina.\nLaboratory test\n- Genetic testing is available for various genes.\nDifferential diagnosis", "- Senior-Loken syndrome (Juvenile nephronophthisis with LCA):\n- Juvenile nephronophthisis (medullary cystic renal disease)\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy\n- Conorenal syndrome (Renal dysplasia, retinal pigmentary dystrophy, cerebellar ataxia, and skeletal dysplasia or Short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly; SRTD9): Cone-shaped digital epiphyses\n- Joubert syndrome:\n- Nephronophthisis (a juvenile-onset cystic kidney disease)\n- Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy, and\n- Either or both of the following: Episodic hyperpnea and/or apnea\n- Peroxisome biogenesis disorders: A spectrum three phenotypes described before the biochemical and molecular basis of the disorders were known:\n- Zellweger syndrome (ZS) - Features include retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay with hypotonia, and liver dysfunction.

However, it is likely that development of keratoconus is due to a combination of genetic environmental and toxic (retinal death) factors.\nCataracts are also a known association of LCA. Etiology is similarly unclear but also likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental and toxic factors.\nManagement", "To date no substantial treatment or cure for LCA exists for most forms (see medical therapy section below). Affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error, use of low-vision aids when possible, and optimal access to educational and work-related opportunities.\nThere are several clinical trials, in different phases, involving specific mutation treatment  by gene replacement therapy or photo pigment supplementation.\nMedical therapy\nIn 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Philadelphia, PA), for the treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated- LCA2. This was the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved gene therapy product for the eye. RPE65 mutation accounts for only a minority of patients with LCA. For the other mutations there is no effective therapy proven so far. However, reduction in light exposure is recommended to avoid photophobia.\nGene Therapy", "The general theory behind gene therapy is that in a person with a known mutations of a coding region of a single gene, introduction of a normal allele can return cells to normal functioning. Gene therapy was first attempted in the Briard dog who was discovered to have similar clinical characteristics to humans of disease resulting from RPE65 gene mutation. In fact, there are a number of gene mutations in the RPE65 gene that are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies in both humans and dogs. The Briard dog was famously the first successful retinal gene therapy performed in animal models. Multiple studies have reported the restoration of vision in Briard dogs with RPE65 mutation using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors as effective gene delivery vehicles for treatment of retinal diseases. These breakthroughs served as the basis for clinical trials of gene therapy in humans.", "The FDA approval of sequential and bilateral injection of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to treat visually impaired patients who carry an RPE65 mutation was based on 1-year data from the only randomized controlled phase III clinical study to date, which demonstrated significant vision improvement as a result of the treatment.  Patients with LCA2, a mutation of RPE65 gene were treated with injection of adenovirus vector carrying a normal copy of the RPE65 gene. Multiyear follow-up evaluation of the patients from two other trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00481546 and NCT00643747), however, revealed progressive decline of clinical benefits including retinal sensitivity, visual acuity, and functional gain following an initial peak seen at 6\u2013 12 months after the treatment.", "Many additional gene therapy programs targeting both inherited retinal diseases and other ocular diseases are underway with animal models including treatment for GUCY2D, AIPL1 and CEP290 mutations found in other LCA subtypes. These studies are also using viral vectors to deliver normal genes and are showing promise in the rescue of rod-cone photoreceptors.\nMedical follow up", "Close follow-up of infants with LCA is recommended with diagnostic ERG. Fundus photos and detailed retinal examination may be helpful. Low vision referral may be warranted. Genetic counseling is recommended for families and patients. At conception, each sibling of an individual with recessively inherited LCA has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family are known. Pre-implantation genetics may be considered in this patient population.\nSurgery\nGene therapy is a technique where the genes are delivered through vector virus injected subretinally.\nPrognosis", "The disease has three subtypes: stable, progressive decline and appreciable improvement. Three separate studies with a total of 90 patients with LCA documented the prevalence of patients in each category. In summary, 15%, 75%, and 10% of cases have showed deterioration, stability and improvement, respectively. The category to which patients belonged was dependent on the subtype of LCA each patient had.\nReferences\n- \u2191 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue. Then your cells take up the vector along with the changed genes.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell.

It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells.

Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "In another type of gene therapy, a viral vector is infused directly into the blood or into a selected organ.

Sometimes the virus triggers a dangerous immune response. In addition, vectors that integrate the genetic material into a chromosome can cause errors that lead to cancer. Researchers are developing newer technologies that can deliver genetic material or gene-editing tools without using viruses. One such technique uses special structures called nanoparticles as vectors to deliver the genetic material or gene-editing components into cells. Nanoparticles are incredibly small structures that have been developed for many uses.

This condition is caused by specific genetic mutations, which can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The disease entity has been described as a family of congenital retinal dystrophies, with different types identified based on the specific gene affected.\n\nOne of the most common forms of LCA is LCA1, which is caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that is essential for the functioning of the retina's photoreceptors, specifically the rods. These photoreceptors are responsible for night and low light vision, and their dysfunction leads to severe vision loss in LCA patients.\n\nGene therapy has emerged as a potential treatment for LCA, with the successful trial at the University of Pennsylvania showcasing its potential. The therapy involves introducing a healthy copy of the faulty gene into the cells to correct the underlying genetic problem. This treatment has shown promising results in improving vision in LCA patients and has been approved by the FDA for clinical use in certain conditions.\n\nThe specific genetic mutations responsible for LCA1 have been identified as OMIM numbers 204000, and inheritance is autosomal recessive.

These genes encode retinal proteins that affect one of seven pathways, the disruption of each of which causes retinal degeneration:\n- The phototransduction cascade (GYCY2D, AIPL1, and RD3);\n- The retinoid cycle (RPE65, LRAT, and RDH12);\n- Retinal development (CRX);\n- The intraflagellar transport (SPATA7, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CEP290, TULP1, NPHP5, CLUAP1, and IFT140);\n- Photoreceptor structure (CRB1 and PRPH2);\n- Photoreceptor ion channels (KCNJ13);\n- Metabolic enzymes for cellular survival (IMPDH1 and NMNAT1).1", "Epidemiology\nLeber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the second most common group of inherited retinal dystrophies after retinitis pigmentosa, accounting for about 5% of all retinal dystrophies. With an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 per 33,0002 to 1 per 81,000,3 LCA accounts for about 20% of legal blindness in children.4\nClinical Findings", "LCA manifests itself in the first 6 months of life with significant visual loss and sensory, pendular nystagmus. Visual acuity (VA) in children with LCA varies significantly among patients with differing gene mutations and can be as low as no light perception (NLP). This variability has led in recent years to some confusion about terminology and the clinical diagnosis of this group of disorders. For example, patients with mutations in CRB1, LRAT, CEP290, or RPE65 may have VA better than 20/50 and may actually be diagnosed later in early childhood, and sometimes designated as having early-onset childhood retinal dystrophy or early-onset severe childhood retinal dystrophy, rather than LCA. There is a progressive decline in the visual function of all patients", ".5 The retinal phenotype in LCA is extremely variable and includes a relatively normal appearance (Figures 1 and 2); typical vascular attenuation and bone-spicule pigmentation (Figure 3); nummular pigmentation, maculopathy with atrophic changes (Figure 4), or colobomatous-like macular changes; thickening of the macula with sparing of the para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Figure 5); and Coats-like exudative vasculopathy. Interestingly, there are phenotypic-genotypic correlations characteristic of some fundus changes. We have summarized the genetic and clinical characteristics of each genetic type of LCA in Table 1. Diagnostic findings such as non-recordable electroretinograms (ERGs) and specific optical coherence tomography (OCT) or fundus autofluorescence (FAF) findings add to the phenotypic-genotypic correlations (Table 1)", ". Other clinical findings, such as refractive error, photophobia, photodysphoria, sluggish and poorly reactive pupils, oculodigital sign, keratoconus, and cataracts can be part of the phenotypic manifestations of LCA (Table 1).", "Figure 1.

MZSDS is part of the autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathies known as short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) with or without polydactyly. The alternative designation of MZSDS is short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly. MZSDS is caused by mutations in IFT40 (OMIM# 614620), which is a ciliary transport gene involved in retrograde transport (Table 1). MZSDS patients can display early onset LCA-like retinal dystrophy with visual impairment and undetectable ERG.78,109", "Conorenal syndrome (OMIM# 266920) includes early-onset LCA-like retinal dystrophy, cone-shaped phalangeal epiphyses of the hands, chronic renal failure, and ataxia80,81 This syndrome has been associated with pathologic mutations in IFT40 (OMIM# 614620). Fundus findings were reported as nonpigmented atypical retinal degeneration progressing to bone spicules deposition.110\nLCA Classifications\nLCA can be classified based on disease pathway, OCT findings, or retinal histopathology.\nLCA classification based on disease pathway", "There are currently 7 known, distinct pathways that are affected by one of the 20 mutant LCA genes. LCA disease pathway 1 involves molecules necessary for the phototransduction cascade, and includes the following genes: GYCY2D, AIPL1, and RD3. Disease pathway 2 is in the retinoid cycle and includes the RPE65, LRAT, and RDH12 genes. Disease pathway 3 includes the retinal transcription factor, which includes CRX. Disease pathway 4 involves intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and includes mutations in SPATA7, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CEP290, TULP1, NPHP5, CLUAP1, and IFT140. CRB1 and PRPH2 are included in disease pathway 5, which is involved in photoreceptor morphogenesis. Disease pathway 6 is in metabolic enzymes for cellular survival and includes IMPDH1 and NMNAT1. Finally, disease pathway 7 is in photoreceptor ion channels and is represented by mutations in KCNJ13.\nLCA classification based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings", "According to Jacobson et al., 201634 there are four major retinal architecture categories of LCA:\nType 1: Normal in vivo retinal architecture: LCA patients with GUCY2D mutations can display subnormal retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thicknesses within the central foveal degrees and normal parafoveal thickness.1\nType 2: Thickened retina: This pattern, which is specific to CRB1 mutations, is characterized by a reduced foveal ONL, limited extra-central ONL, and thickened dysplastic or \u201cunlaminated\u201d retinal layers across the rest of the retina.1\nType 3: Normal foveal architecture: This OCT laminar pattern is specific for a preserved central foveal island of ONL that decreases in thickness eccentrically. Mutations in RPE65 (LCA2), Lebercilin (LCA5), RPGRIP1 (LCA6), CEP290 (LCA10), and TULP1 (LCA15) have been associated with this phenotype.1", "Type 4: Severe macular atrophy or foveal maldevelopment: This OCT pattern is associated with LCA mutations displaying severe maculopathies, namely AIPL1 (LCA4), NMNAT1 (LCA9) and RDH12 (LCA13). Note that the colobomatous-like maculopathy seen with NMNAT1 (LCA9) mutations is possibly due to a congenital lack of foveal formation and inner retinal layers. All 3 mutations show a reduced central ONL. The parafoveal retinal thickness varies in AIPL1 (LCA4) and RDH12 (LCA13) patients but is significantly thinned in NMNAT1 (LCA9).1\nLCA classification based on retinal histopathology findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning. Monitoring and treating possible clinical associations, such as renal failure and hearing loss, is primordial to maximize patients\u2019 quality of life.", "There have been significant advances in therapeutic modalities, including gene replacement, stem cell therapy, and pharmacologic therapies in a number of inherited retinal diseases. Gene replacement therapy using subretinal injection of genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown very promising results in several LCA animal models and humans: GUCY2D RetGC1 mouse models,111-113 RPE65 Briard dogs,114 and mouse models20,115-118 as well as AIPL1 knock-out mouse models,119 AAV-based gene replacement was shown to preserve and rescue photoreceptors (both rods and cones) and improve and restore retinal function. Based on this success, human clinical trials for LCA patients were undertaken globally and are at various stages of completion (Table 2).", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "Oral substitutes of key components of the visual pathway have been clinically tested and have been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and adults with RPE65 and LRAT mutations.125,126 The 2 phases I/II clinical trials using a synthetic prodrug precursor to 9-cis-retinal, QLT091001, showed both significant enlargement of the kinetic visual field and improvement in visual acuity in 44% and 67% of participants, respectively.126 A phase III trial with the same agent is being planned.\nFinally, human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) therapy holds future promise as it aims to regenerate dysfunctional RPE cells. Currently, 2 human phase I/II stem cell clinical trials have demonstrated successful RPE integration of injected hESCs.127,128 The integration and transplantation of stem cells to the photoreceptor layer, which is needed for LCA therapy, is still in the preclinical stage.\nReferences", "- Coussa RG, Lopez Solache I, Koenekoop RK.

Learn about the types, risks and FDA-approved products of gene therapy from Mayo Clinic.", "snippets": ["Overview\nGenes contain DNA \u2014 the code that controls much of the body's form and function. DNA controls everything from hair color and height to breathing, walking and digesting food. Genes that don't work properly can cause disease. Sometimes these genes are called mutations.\nGene therapy aims to fix a faulty gene or replace it with a healthy gene to try to cure disease or make the body better able to fight disease. It holds promise as a treatment for a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, hemophilia and AIDS.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved gene therapy products for several conditions, including cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. But for most people, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.", "Clinical trials are research studies that help healthcare professionals find out whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes. These particles can carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into the DNA of your cells.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue. Then your cells take up the vector along with the changed genes.", "In another type of gene therapy, a viral vector is infused directly into the blood or into a selected organ. Talk with your healthcare team to find out what type of gene therapy would be used and what you can expect.\nResults\nGene therapy is a promising treatment and a growing area of research. But its clinical use is limited today.\nIn the U.S., FDA-approved gene therapy products include:\n- Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta). This gene therapy is for adults who have certain types of large B-cell lymphoma that don't respond to treatment.\n- Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma). This gene therapy can be used to treat children under age 2 who have spinal muscular atrophy.\n- Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic).

Gene therapy techniques allow doctors to treat a disorder by altering a person\u2019s genetic makeup instead of using drugs or surgery.\nThe earliest method of gene therapy, often called gene transfer or gene addition, was developed to:\n- Introduce a new gene into cells to help fight a disease.\n- Introduce a non-faulty copy of a gene to stand in for the altered copy causing disease.\nLater studies led to advances in gene therapy techniques. A newer technique, called genome editing (an example of which is CRISPR-Cas9), uses a different approach to correct genetic differences. Instead of introducing new genetic material into cells, genome editing introduces molecular tools to change the existing DNA in the cell. Genome editing is being studied to:\n- Fix a genetic alteration underlying a disorder, so the gene can function properly.\n- Turn on a gene to help fight a disease.", "- Turn off a gene that is functioning improperly.\n- Remove a piece of DNA that is impairing gene function and causing disease.\nGene therapies are being used to treat a small number of diseases, including an eye disorder called Leber congenital amaurosis and a muscle disorder called spinal muscular atrophy. Many more gene therapies are undergoing research to make sure that they will be safe and effective. Genome editing is a promising technique also under study that doctors hope to use soon to treat disorders in people.\nTopics in the Gene Therapy and Other Medical Advances chapter\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

Affected infants may show misaligned eyes when looking at something (strabismus), aversion to light (photophobia), and poke or rub at their eyes (Franceschetti\u2019s oculodigital sign). Those with LCA invariably experience vision problems. Affected infants show decreased visual response to objects. Loss of visual acuity is severe, with affected individuals' vision ranging from 20/200 to 20/400.[note 1] Around a third of those affected completely lose perception of light.\nAt an eye exam, the pupils may not respond normally to light.

It should not be confused with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy described by the same physician in 1871. Leber also described 'Leber miliary aneurysms' now thought to be a variant of Coats disease.\nPrimary Prevention\nGenetic testing before pregnancy or prenatal testing can identify patients at risk of passing this condition on to offspring.\nEtiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases. Various phenotypes (LCA1 to LCA19) with at least 29 genotypes have been identified that account for around 70-80% of cases, with thereby more genes yet to be identified.  These genes are known to be important in several retinal developmental and physiologic pathways. Genes with known mutations are GUCY2D, RPE65, SPATA7, AIPL1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CRX, CRB1, NMNAT1, CEP290, IMPDH1, RD3, RDH12, LRAT, TULP1, KCNJ13, GDF6, CABP4, CNGA3, ALMS1, IQCB1, MYO7A. The other genes causing LCA are unknown. CEP290 (15%), GUCY2D (12%), and CRB1 (10%) and RPE65 (8%) are the most frequently mutated LCA genes.\nHistory", "German ophthalmologist, Theodor Leber, first described the dystrophy in 1869 in a blind child with wandering nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and congenital retinitis pigmentosa. In 1957, a non-recordable ERG (electroretinogram) was identified as a common feature essential to diagnosis of LCA. It was at this time that the disease was named. At the same time, a Swedish study identified the disease to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. This dystrophy is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disease affecting 1 in 30000 to 1 in 81000 subjects.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors are affected parent and/or parents who are carriers of a mutated gene responsible for one of the 17 LCA subtypes.\nGeneral Pathology\nThe histopathology showed the involvement of outer retina and photoreceptors and suggested that the LCA is a degenerative process rather than agenesis.\nPathophysiology", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "The estimated birth prevalence of LCA is two to three per 100,000 births. LCA represents almost 5% of all retinal dystrophies and 20% of children with visual impairment in special schools.\nDiagnosis\nHistory\nLCA is characterized by significant vision loss in infancy. It may be suspected in a young child with decreased visual response, nystagmus, poorly reactive pupils, and an extinguished ERG. Family history is typically consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.\nDiagnosis is clinical in this disorder, requiring thorough clinical evaluation and ophthalmic history. Diagnosis is supported by ERG and OCT (optical coherence tomography). Precise diagnosis requires molecular gene testing. Gene testing such as DNA microarray, next generation sequencing, linkage analysis and homozygosity/autozygosity mapping are used to identify specific gene mutations in LCA.", "LCA is characterized by at least three findings: severe and early visual impairment, sluggish or absent pupillary responses, and severely subnormal or non-detectible ERG.\nNo retinal lesion is diagnostic of LCA or specific for a certain subtype. Infants usually have normal fundus appearance and fundus abnormalities present later in life.\nSigns\n- Abnormal or absent pupillary response\n- Keratoconus\n- Nystagmus noticed early in life, present from birth, can be pendular or roving and is present in all positions of gaze\n- Photophobia\n- Nyctalopia\n- Vision loss (typically ranging from 20/200 to complete blindness)\n- Hyperopia is commonly found but myopia has also been reported. High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "- Non-ophthalmologic features include mental retardation and olfactory dysfunction, in addition to stereotypical movements and behaviors\nRetinal exam\n- The retina appears normal initially. Later, a variety of abnormalities may develop either in isolation or combination. They include: chorioretinal degeneration and atrophy centered around the fovea, \u201cbone-spicule\" like pigmentation, subretinal flecks, \"marbled\" fundus, pigmented nummular lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), optic disc abnormalities, and \u201cCoats like\u201d reaction.\n- Oculo-digital sign comprising eye poking, pressing, and rubbing likely producing mechanical retinal stimulation. The major sequel is enophthalmos, a physical defect in which the eye recedes into the orbit, presumably from atrophy of orbital fat. This behavior is performed to in an effort to stimulate vision.", "- Intellectual Disability: Rarely, LCA is seen in association with neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and oculomotor apraxia-type behavior.\nSymptoms\nVisual impairment\nProfound visual impairment is usually present from birth. One-third of individuals with LCA have no perception of light. Visual acuity is, with rare exceptions, 20/400 and below. The visual impairment is generally stable or very slowly progressive. Occasionally in the early stages, a mild degree of visual improvement is observed, followed by progressive degradation. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings and ERG. LCA has retinal, ocular, and extraocular features and occasionally, systemic associations. Recent evidence shows that not the genetics of LCA but the low vision can increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder. \nDiagnostic procedures", "- ERG: Nonrecordable/Extinguished or severely reduced scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) is typical in LCA. Normal ERG responses rule out a diagnosis of LCA. Visual evoked responses are variable. ERG measures electrical response of retina which are decreased or absent in LCA.\n- Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF): Autofluorescence measures lipofuscin accumulation in RPE which is related to shed photoreceptor disc elements. Amount of autofluorescence in LCA varies by subtype. For example, autofluorescence is normal in GUCY2D mutation but absent in RPE65 mutations. Abnormalities on FAF include a ring of macular hypo/hyper AF or peripheral hypo-AF. \n- OCT: OCT is high resolution cross sectional images of retinal architecture. In LCA, retinal atrophy is common. In advanced LCA, retinal arterioles are attenuated reflecting overall metabolic status of the retina.\nLaboratory test\n- Genetic testing is available for various genes.\nDifferential diagnosis", "- Senior-Loken syndrome (Juvenile nephronophthisis with LCA):\n- Juvenile nephronophthisis (medullary cystic renal disease)\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy\n- Conorenal syndrome (Renal dysplasia, retinal pigmentary dystrophy, cerebellar ataxia, and skeletal dysplasia or Short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly; SRTD9): Cone-shaped digital epiphyses\n- Joubert syndrome:\n- Nephronophthisis (a juvenile-onset cystic kidney disease)\n- Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy, and\n- Either or both of the following: Episodic hyperpnea and/or apnea\n- Peroxisome biogenesis disorders: A spectrum three phenotypes described before the biochemical and molecular basis of the disorders were known:\n- Zellweger syndrome (ZS) - Features include retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay with hypotonia, and liver dysfunction.

However, it is likely that development of keratoconus is due to a combination of genetic environmental and toxic (retinal death) factors.\nCataracts are also a known association of LCA. Etiology is similarly unclear but also likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental and toxic factors.\nManagement", "To date no substantial treatment or cure for LCA exists for most forms (see medical therapy section below). Affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error, use of low-vision aids when possible, and optimal access to educational and work-related opportunities.\nThere are several clinical trials, in different phases, involving specific mutation treatment  by gene replacement therapy or photo pigment supplementation.\nMedical therapy\nIn 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Philadelphia, PA), for the treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated- LCA2. This was the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved gene therapy product for the eye. RPE65 mutation accounts for only a minority of patients with LCA. For the other mutations there is no effective therapy proven so far. However, reduction in light exposure is recommended to avoid photophobia.\nGene Therapy", "The general theory behind gene therapy is that in a person with a known mutations of a coding region of a single gene, introduction of a normal allele can return cells to normal functioning. Gene therapy was first attempted in the Briard dog who was discovered to have similar clinical characteristics to humans of disease resulting from RPE65 gene mutation. In fact, there are a number of gene mutations in the RPE65 gene that are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies in both humans and dogs. The Briard dog was famously the first successful retinal gene therapy performed in animal models. Multiple studies have reported the restoration of vision in Briard dogs with RPE65 mutation using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors as effective gene delivery vehicles for treatment of retinal diseases. These breakthroughs served as the basis for clinical trials of gene therapy in humans.", "The FDA approval of sequential and bilateral injection of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to treat visually impaired patients who carry an RPE65 mutation was based on 1-year data from the only randomized controlled phase III clinical study to date, which demonstrated significant vision improvement as a result of the treatment.  Patients with LCA2, a mutation of RPE65 gene were treated with injection of adenovirus vector carrying a normal copy of the RPE65 gene. Multiyear follow-up evaluation of the patients from two other trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00481546 and NCT00643747), however, revealed progressive decline of clinical benefits including retinal sensitivity, visual acuity, and functional gain following an initial peak seen at 6\u2013 12 months after the treatment.", "Many additional gene therapy programs targeting both inherited retinal diseases and other ocular diseases are underway with animal models including treatment for GUCY2D, AIPL1 and CEP290 mutations found in other LCA subtypes. These studies are also using viral vectors to deliver normal genes and are showing promise in the rescue of rod-cone photoreceptors.\nMedical follow up", "Close follow-up of infants with LCA is recommended with diagnostic ERG. Fundus photos and detailed retinal examination may be helpful. Low vision referral may be warranted. Genetic counseling is recommended for families and patients. At conception, each sibling of an individual with recessively inherited LCA has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family are known. Pre-implantation genetics may be considered in this patient population.\nSurgery\nGene therapy is a technique where the genes are delivered through vector virus injected subretinally.\nPrognosis", "The disease has three subtypes: stable, progressive decline and appreciable improvement. Three separate studies with a total of 90 patients with LCA documented the prevalence of patients in each category. In summary, 15%, 75%, and 10% of cases have showed deterioration, stability and improvement, respectively. The category to which patients belonged was dependent on the subtype of LCA each patient had.\nReferences\n- \u2191 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

This approach is particularly useful in treating genetic diseases caused by a single mutation, such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) [2]. LCA is a rare inherited eye disease that affects about 1 in 40,000 newborns [7]. It is caused by genetic mutations that affect the development of the retina, the layer at the back of the eye responsible for processing light into images [6]. Mutations in different genes can result in different forms of LCA, with each form having its own OMIM number [8]. However, one form of LCA, LCA1, was successfully treated with gene therapy in 2008, as reported in [7].\n\nThe successful trial at the University of Pennsylvania, as mentioned in [4], focused on using gene therapy to treat LCA1. The therapy involved injecting a virus containing a healthy copy of the gene RPE65, which is mutated in LCA1, into the patient's eye [5]. This virus acted as a vehicle to deliver the healthy gene into the retinal cells, allowing them to produce the necessary protein and improve vision. The trial resulted in significant improvements in vision for patients, with some experiencing a 10,000-fold improvement [4].\n\nGene therapy for LCA1 has shown great promise in improving vision and could potentially be used to treat other forms of LCA and even other genetic disorders [3]. This has far-reaching implications, as it showcases the potential of genetic medicine to tackle hereditary conditions, as discussed in [1]. The success of this trial has also raised the possibility of gene therapy becoming more widely available in the future, potentially improving the quality of life for patients with inherited eye conditions and other genetic disorders [3].\n\nIn conclusion, gene therapy has the potential to revolutionize vision by addressing genetic mutations and restoring the functions of critical proteins, as seen in the successful trial at the University of Pennsylvania.

Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases.

If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes.

For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue.

Proteins are the workhorses of the cell and the structural basis of the body\u2019s tissues.

Instead, a carrier called a vector is genetically engineered to carry and deliver the material. Certain viruses are used as vectors because they can deliver the material by infecting the cell. The viruses are modified so they can't cause disease when used in people. Some types of virus, such as retroviruses, integrate their genetic material (including the new gene) into a chromosome in the human cell. Other viruses, such as adenoviruses, introduce their DNA into the nucleus of the cell, but the DNA is not integrated into a chromosome. Viruses can also deliver the gene-editing tools to the nucleus of the cell.", "The vector can be injected or given intravenously (by IV) directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Alternately, a sample of the patient's cells can be removed and exposed to the vector in a laboratory setting. The cells containing the vector are then returned to the patient. If the treatment is successful, the new gene delivered by the vector will make a functioning protein or the editing molecules will correct a DNA error and restore protein function.", "Gene therapy with viral vectors has been successful, but it does carry some risk. Sometimes the virus triggers a dangerous immune response. In addition, vectors that integrate the genetic material into a chromosome can cause errors that lead to cancer. Researchers are developing newer technologies that can deliver genetic material or gene-editing tools without using viruses. One such technique uses special structures called nanoparticles as vectors to deliver the genetic material or gene-editing components into cells. Nanoparticles are incredibly small structures that have been developed for many uses. For gene therapy, these tiny particles are designed with specific characteristics to target them to particular cell types. Nanoparticles are less likely to cause immune reactions than viral vectors, and they are easier to design and modify for specific purposes.", "Researchers continue to work to overcome the many technical challenges of gene therapy.

For the first part of the study, cohorts of three adults each received one of the three different dosages: Low, mid, and high. Evaluations were held between each level of dosage to ensure that they were safe before upping the dosage for the next cohort. A second phase of the study involved only administering the high dosage levels to both an adult cohort of three and a pediatric cohort of three, again after safety reviews of the previous cohorts.", "Improvements were noticed quickly, often within the first month, after the therapy was applied and lasted for at least 12 months.

LCA was first described by Theodor Leber in the 19th century. It should not be confused with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, which is a different disease also described by Theodor Leber.\nOne form of LCA was successfully treated with gene therapy in 2008.\nSigns and symptoms", "[edit]LCA symptoms typically begin in the first few months of life, most commonly with involuntary twitching of the eye (nystagmus). Affected infants may show misaligned eyes when looking at something (strabismus), aversion to light (photophobia), and poke or rub at their eyes (Franceschetti\u2019s oculodigital sign). Those with LCA invariably experience vision problems. Affected infants show decreased visual response to objects. Loss of visual acuity is severe, with affected individuals' vision ranging from 20/200 to 20/400.[note 1] Around a third of those affected completely lose perception of light.\nAt an eye exam, the pupils may not respond normally to light. Some affected individuals have cloudy eyes (cataracts), and irregularly shaped corneas (keratoconus). Retinal exams typically look normal, especially in the young, though retinal abnormalities can appear later in life.\nAside from eye problems, children with LCA are typically healthy.\nCause", "[edit]LCA is a genetic disease and can be caused by pathogenic variants in at least 28 different genes. Variants in three of these genes \u2013 IMPDH1, OTX2, and CRX \u2013 can cause LCA in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning inheriting a single copy of a pathogenic variant can result in disease. Variants in the remaining genes associated with LCA cause disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning one must inherit copies of the pathogenic variant from both parents to develop LCA. Genes associated with LCA have a variety of roles in the development of the eye:\n- OTX2 is involved in the development of the retina;\n- CRB1, CRX, GDF6, and PRPH2 in the formation of retinal photoreceptor cells;\n- AIPL1 and GUCY2D in phototransduction (converting light into electrical signals for the brain);\n- ALMS1, CCT2, CEP290, CLUAP1, IFT140, IQCB1, LCA5, MYO7A, RD3, RPGRIP1, SPATA7, and TULP1 in maintaining the cilia on photoreceptor cells;", "- LRAT, RDH12, and RPE65 in replenishing retinal levels for the visual cycle;\n- IMPDH1 in guanine synthesis (involved in maintaining retinal levels);\n- CABP4, CNGA3, and KCNJ13 in photoreceptor response to light.\nPathogenic variants of any of these genes cause dysfunction in those associated processes, which leads to severe vision loss. Variants in DTHD1 and NMNAT1 also cause LCA, though these genes' roles in vision development are not yet known.\nAmong the gene variants that cause LCA, CEP290 and GUCYD variants are the most common, each causing up to 20% of LCA cases. Other common variants are in CRB1 (around 10% of cases), RPE65 (up to 10%), AIPL1 (up to 8%), RDH12 (up to 5%), and RPGRIP1 (around 5%). Around 25% of people with LCA do not have any of the known LCA-causing pathogenic gene variants; the cause of their LCA is unknown.\nDiagnosis", "[edit]LCA is diagnosed clinically, by a combination of vision loss, an abnormal response of the pupils to light, and by abnormal response to electroretinography, a test that measures the electrical response of the retina to light.\nTreatment", "[edit]One form of LCA, in patients with LCA2 bearing a mutation in the RPE65 gene, has been successfully treated in clinical trials using gene therapy. The results of three early clinical trials were published in 2008 demonstrating the safety and efficacy of using adeno-associated virus to deliver gene therapy to restore vision in LCA patients. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side effects. These studies, which used adeno-associated virus, have spawned a number of new studies investigating gene therapy for human retinal disease.[citation needed] On 19 December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy for children and adults with biallelic RPE65 gene mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis", ". Patients must have viable retinal cells as a prerequisite for the intraocular administration of Luxturna. Another recent trial from The OHSU Casey Eye Institute used CRISPR to treat LCA starting in 2020. The experimental treatment consisted in editing a mutation of the CEP290 gene, which provides instructions to create a protein that is critical for sight. Results were released in 2023 with 79% of the patients showing improvement in at least one of four measured outcomes. ", "For those who cannot benefit from gene therapy, LCA treatment is supportive, and meant to facilitate living with visual impairment. Some benefit from vision aids such as glasses, magnifiers, and enhancers. Other resources helpful for those with visual impairment include educational programs, special education teachers, and service animals.\nEpidemiology\n[edit]Around 2\u20133 out of every 100,000 people have LCA \u2013 an estimated 180,000 people worldwide. LCA is a common cause of blindness in the young; around 20% of children in schools for the blind have LCA.\nHistory\n[edit]LCA was originally described as a variety of retinitis pigmentosa by Theodor Leber in 1869.\nPopular culture", "[edit]- In the episode \"The Blackout in the Blizzard\" (Season 6, Episode 16) of the television drama Bones, Dr. Jack Hodgins and his pregnant wife Angela Montenegro, who is an LCA carrier, have to wait during a citywide blackout for Hodgins's genetic test results, to see if he is also an LCA carrier. He does indeed turn out to be a carrier, giving their unborn child a 25% chance of having LCA.[citation needed]\n- In the television series ER (Season 14, Episode 12 \"Believe the Unseen\") Dr. Abby Lockhart diagnoses a young foster girl with Leber congenital amaurosis. The girl to this point hid her condition from her foster families. The episode contains some information about symptoms, clinical diagnosis and mentions gene replacement therapy and clinical trials as hope for help in managing the condition.[citation needed]", "- In the Korean drama The King of Dramas (Episode 16, \"In Search of Lost Time\") Anthony Kim, played by Kim Myung-min, is diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis, the same disease that made his mother blind.[citation needed]\n- Four-year-old Gavin who suffers from a form of LCA was made famous in 2013 by a YouTube video showing him using his white cane for the first time to navigate down a curb.

Visual acuity (VA) in children with LCA varies significantly among patients with differing gene mutations and can be as low as no light perception (NLP). This variability has led in recent years to some confusion about terminology and the clinical diagnosis of this group of disorders. For example, patients with mutations in CRB1, LRAT, CEP290, or RPE65 may have VA better than 20/50 and may actually be diagnosed later in early childhood, and sometimes designated as having early-onset childhood retinal dystrophy or early-onset severe childhood retinal dystrophy, rather than LCA. There is a progressive decline in the visual function of all patients", ".5 The retinal phenotype in LCA is extremely variable and includes a relatively normal appearance (Figures 1 and 2); typical vascular attenuation and bone-spicule pigmentation (Figure 3); nummular pigmentation, maculopathy with atrophic changes (Figure 4), or colobomatous-like macular changes; thickening of the macula with sparing of the para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Figure 5); and Coats-like exudative vasculopathy. Interestingly, there are phenotypic-genotypic correlations characteristic of some fundus changes. We have summarized the genetic and clinical characteristics of each genetic type of LCA in Table 1. Diagnostic findings such as non-recordable electroretinograms (ERGs) and specific optical coherence tomography (OCT) or fundus autofluorescence (FAF) findings add to the phenotypic-genotypic correlations (Table 1)", ". Other clinical findings, such as refractive error, photophobia, photodysphoria, sluggish and poorly reactive pupils, oculodigital sign, keratoconus, and cataracts can be part of the phenotypic manifestations of LCA (Table 1).", "Figure 1.

Classic phenotypic manifestations include cerebellar and brainstem malformations (molar tooth sign), as well as hypotonia and developmental delay.90 However, patients often present with other findings, including juvenile-onset cystic nephronophthisis, early-onset LCA-like retinal dystrophy and either nystagmoid eye movement, episodic hyperpnea and/or apnea, or both.90 Mutations in the following genes have been reported to cause Joubert syndrome with oculo-renal disease:", "- TMEM216 (OMIM# 613277) causes JBTS2 (OMIM# 608091).

MZSDS is part of the autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathies known as short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) with or without polydactyly. The alternative designation of MZSDS is short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly. MZSDS is caused by mutations in IFT40 (OMIM# 614620), which is a ciliary transport gene involved in retrograde transport (Table 1). MZSDS patients can display early onset LCA-like retinal dystrophy with visual impairment and undetectable ERG.78,109", "Conorenal syndrome (OMIM# 266920) includes early-onset LCA-like retinal dystrophy, cone-shaped phalangeal epiphyses of the hands, chronic renal failure, and ataxia80,81 This syndrome has been associated with pathologic mutations in IFT40 (OMIM# 614620). Fundus findings were reported as nonpigmented atypical retinal degeneration progressing to bone spicules deposition.110\nLCA Classifications\nLCA can be classified based on disease pathway, OCT findings, or retinal histopathology.\nLCA classification based on disease pathway", "There are currently 7 known, distinct pathways that are affected by one of the 20 mutant LCA genes. LCA disease pathway 1 involves molecules necessary for the phototransduction cascade, and includes the following genes: GYCY2D, AIPL1, and RD3. Disease pathway 2 is in the retinoid cycle and includes the RPE65, LRAT, and RDH12 genes. Disease pathway 3 includes the retinal transcription factor, which includes CRX. Disease pathway 4 involves intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and includes mutations in SPATA7, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CEP290, TULP1, NPHP5, CLUAP1, and IFT140. CRB1 and PRPH2 are included in disease pathway 5, which is involved in photoreceptor morphogenesis. Disease pathway 6 is in metabolic enzymes for cellular survival and includes IMPDH1 and NMNAT1. Finally, disease pathway 7 is in photoreceptor ion channels and is represented by mutations in KCNJ13.\nLCA classification based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings", "According to Jacobson et al., 201634 there are four major retinal architecture categories of LCA:\nType 1: Normal in vivo retinal architecture: LCA patients with GUCY2D mutations can display subnormal retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thicknesses within the central foveal degrees and normal parafoveal thickness.1\nType 2: Thickened retina: This pattern, which is specific to CRB1 mutations, is characterized by a reduced foveal ONL, limited extra-central ONL, and thickened dysplastic or \u201cunlaminated\u201d retinal layers across the rest of the retina.1\nType 3: Normal foveal architecture: This OCT laminar pattern is specific for a preserved central foveal island of ONL that decreases in thickness eccentrically. Mutations in RPE65 (LCA2), Lebercilin (LCA5), RPGRIP1 (LCA6), CEP290 (LCA10), and TULP1 (LCA15) have been associated with this phenotype.1", "Type 4: Severe macular atrophy or foveal maldevelopment: This OCT pattern is associated with LCA mutations displaying severe maculopathies, namely AIPL1 (LCA4), NMNAT1 (LCA9) and RDH12 (LCA13). Note that the colobomatous-like maculopathy seen with NMNAT1 (LCA9) mutations is possibly due to a congenital lack of foveal formation and inner retinal layers. All 3 mutations show a reduced central ONL. The parafoveal retinal thickness varies in AIPL1 (LCA4) and RDH12 (LCA13) patients but is significantly thinned in NMNAT1 (LCA9).1\nLCA classification based on retinal histopathology findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning. Monitoring and treating possible clinical associations, such as renal failure and hearing loss, is primordial to maximize patients\u2019 quality of life.", "There have been significant advances in therapeutic modalities, including gene replacement, stem cell therapy, and pharmacologic therapies in a number of inherited retinal diseases. Gene replacement therapy using subretinal injection of genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown very promising results in several LCA animal models and humans: GUCY2D RetGC1 mouse models,111-113 RPE65 Briard dogs,114 and mouse models20,115-118 as well as AIPL1 knock-out mouse models,119 AAV-based gene replacement was shown to preserve and rescue photoreceptors (both rods and cones) and improve and restore retinal function. Based on this success, human clinical trials for LCA patients were undertaken globally and are at various stages of completion (Table 2).", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "Oral substitutes of key components of the visual pathway have been clinically tested and have been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and adults with RPE65 and LRAT mutations.125,126 The 2 phases I/II clinical trials using a synthetic prodrug precursor to 9-cis-retinal, QLT091001, showed both significant enlargement of the kinetic visual field and improvement in visual acuity in 44% and 67% of participants, respectively.126 A phase III trial with the same agent is being planned.\nFinally, human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) therapy holds future promise as it aims to regenerate dysfunctional RPE cells. Currently, 2 human phase I/II stem cell clinical trials have demonstrated successful RPE integration of injected hESCs.127,128 The integration and transplantation of stem cells to the photoreceptor layer, which is needed for LCA therapy, is still in the preclinical stage.\nReferences", "- Coussa RG, Lopez Solache I, Koenekoop RK.

Therefore, the gene therapy approach used for LCA1 may not be applicable for all forms of Leber congenital amaurosis.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Luxturna is only offered to children who meet certain criteria, which suggests that not all forms of LCA can be treated with this specific gene therapy. Additionally, the Division of Ophthalmology at CHOP states that there are many different gene mutations that can cause retinal dystrophies and determining the specific mutation is crucial for understanding treatment options.\n\nIn conclusion, while the gene therapy approach used for LCA1 has shown promising results, it may not be adaptable for treating other forms of Leber congenital amaurosis or retinal dystrophies caused by different gene mutations.", "user_utterance": "Could you provide insight into whether the gene therapy approach used for LCA1 is adaptable for treating other forms of Leber congenital amaurosis, or is it specific to the RPE65 mutation?", "search_queries": ["Gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis", "RPE65 mutation gene therapy", "Adapting gene therapy for inherited eye conditions"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24167-lebers-congenital-amaurosis", "description": "Gene therapy for Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.
