Emitted largely through the use of fossil fuels, it not only warms the planet now, but will continue to do so for more than a century while it remains in the atmosphere.\nLess well known is the role that another greenhouse gas\u2014methane\u2014plays. About one third of global methane emissions occur naturally, mostly from wetlands. But two-thirds are caused by human activity, including from oil and gas operations, coal mining, landfills, plus livestock and rice paddies. And because of its chemical composition, methane has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide does\u2014up to 80 times as much\u2014and is responsible for about a third of current global warming. But crucially, methane lingers in the atmosphere for much less time than carbon dioxide does\u2014only about 10\u201320 years.\n[2]: How Methane Emissions Contribute to Climate Change\nThe United States and the European Union announced a new pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, with the intention that many more major emitters will join on in the lead up to the annual climate conference in Glasgow later this year. For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.\n[3]: Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), with a global warming potential (GWP) around 28 times greater than the same mass of carbon dioxide emissions on a 100-year basis, and over 80 times more powerful on a 20-year basis. This makes methane second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.\nWhile methane has a significantly higher GWP than carbon dioxide, it also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, and so after about 12 years, the methane in the atmosphere breaks down into GHGs with a lower GWP. In contrast, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for over a century.\nAs a result, the rapid reduction of methane emissions is:\none of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change,\ncritical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels; and\nprobably the single most important climate action we can undertake in the short-term.\n[4]: Benefits and costs of mitigating methane emissions Global Methane Assessment key findings Share SHARE Facebook share Twitter LinkedIn Copy URL Email Breadcrumb Home Tools & resources CCAC assessments Global Methane Assessment Reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest, most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Global action to reduce methane emissions has additional benefits for human health, food security and ecosystems, as it can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant with multiple harmful impacts. As human-caused methane emissions continue to increase, there are more reasons than ever to reduce methane emissions this decade. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition and UN Environment Programme's Global Methane Assessment shows that we have the technologies and policy frameworks to do so cost effectively and with immediate benefits to society\n[5]: Cite report\nIEA (2023), Global Methane Tracker 2023, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2023, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nUnderstanding methane emissions\nMethane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term warming and improving air quality.\nTwo key characteristics determine the impact of different greenhouse gases on the climate: the length of time they remain in the atmosphere and their ability to absorb energy. Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 around 12 years compared with centuries \u2013 but absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere.\nMethane also affects air quality because it can lead to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, a dangerous pollutant. Methane leaks can also pose explosion hazards.\nAtmospheric concentrations of methane are on the rise\n[6]: Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) and the second-biggest contributor to human-caused global warming after carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). Although it has a relatively short life cycle, lasting around a decade in the atmosphere, methane has a\n80 times greater than CO\u2082 over a 20-year period.

According to a recent news article, methane emissions contribute to about one third of current global warming, and it has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide. This has led to increased efforts from major emitters, including the United States and the European Union, to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. [1][2]\n\nIn terms of economic impact, methane emissions can have both negative and positive effects. On the negative side, methane leaks can pose explosion hazards and affect air quality, which can have detrimental effects on local communities. However, on the positive side, reducing methane emissions can lead to economic savings. [3]\n\nOne potential economic benefit is the use of captured methane as a clean energy source, which can potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. This is supported by the Global Methane Assessment, which states that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. [4]\n\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also have additional benefits for human health, food security, and ecosystems. The report highlights that reducing methane emissions can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, and have immediate benefits to society. [4]\n\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that these countries may face in reducing methane emissions. This can be seen in the United States, which had the world's highest methane emissions from oil and gas production in 2022. [7] This highlights the need for international support and cooperation to help these countries overcome these barriers.\n\nIn terms of policy incentives or penalties, there are already efforts in place to incentivize countries to reduce their methane emissions. For instance, the report by the International Energy Agency states that the reduction of methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change and is critical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.

The energy sector \u2013 including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy \u2013 accounts for over a third of methane emissions from human activity. The IEA\u2019s Global Methane Tracker is an indispensable tool in the fight to bring down emissions from across the energy sector.\n[5]: Cite report\nIEA (2022), Global Methane Tracker 2022, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nOverview\nThe 2022 update of the IEA Global Methane Tracker for the first time includes emissions from the coal sector, creating a complete set of emission estimates for the energy sector and cementing the Tracker\u2019s indispensable role in the fight to bring down methane emissions and implement the new Global Methane Pledge.\nA rapid and sustained reduction of methane emissions is both achievable and essential to limit the rise in global average temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, today\u2019s concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are higher than at any time in at least 800 000 years, and methane has contributed around 30% of observed global warming to date.\nMethane emissions from the global energy sector rebounded by almost 5% in 2021\n[6]: Satellite data reveals that methane leaks from two main fossil fuel fields in Turkmenistan caused more global heating last year than all of the carbon emissions in the United Kingdom.

This could potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. However, there are also ethical considerations to be made, as balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship is crucial for sustainable development and corporate responsibility.\n\nThere are several barriers and challenges that these countries face in reducing methane emissions, including infrastructural and technological limitations.

Even if there was no value to the captured gas, almost all available abatement measures would be cost effective in the presence of an emissions price of only about 15 USD/tCO2-eq.\nProven technologies and policies can greatly reduce emissions\n[2]: Unintended methane releases could upend global efforts to curb climate change. That\u2019s the conclusion of a just-released United Nations report and it\u2019s why the U.S. Senate just thwarted a plan by the previous administration to ease methane restrictions. Indeed, the UN\u2019s goal is to cut those heat-trapping emissions by 45% by 2030 using promising technologies.\nThe movement to regulate methane releases is supported among major oil and gas producers that have already invested in mitigation efforts. Moreover, companies like Shell, Equinor, BP, Total, Statoil and EQT are thinking long term: without methane controls, the world can\u2019t limit temperature increases, which then dampens the prospects for natural gas usage; methane is a byproduct of natural gas that, if captured from leaking pipelines and new wells, can be resold.\n[3]: Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform\nLearn about key methane emission sources in the oil and gas industry as well as technologies and practices that can be used to reduce methane emissions from these sources.\nMethane emission sources with the largest contributions to the oil and gas industry in the United States are presented in the chart below.

These include:\n\n1. Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs: These programs use advanced technologies such as infrared cameras and optical gas imaging to identify and repair leaks in pipelines and equipment.\n\n2. Vapor recovery units (VRUs): These units capture and recycle methane emissions from oil storage tanks, reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.\n\n3. Reduced emission completions (RECs): This method involves using special equipment and processes during the well completion phase to minimize methane emissions from newly drilled wells.\n\n4. Methane detectors: These devices are used to monitor and detect methane leaks in real-time, allowing for immediate action to be taken.\n\n5. Methane capture and utilization: This involves capturing methane emissions and using it as a clean energy source, either for on-site operations or for sale.\n\nWhile these technologies and methods are readily available, there are still infrastructural and technological barriers in certain countries, as well as the need for international support and policy incentives to encourage their implementation. However, the economic benefits of reducing methane emissions, such as increased exports and reduced energy costs, could provide the necessary motivation for countries to invest in these technologies. In addition to economic benefits, there is also the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility, which could resonate with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility. Ultimately, reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector is not only crucial for mitigating climate change, but also for improving air quality and the quality of life for local communities affected by these emissions.

Letting the gas escape unburned would lead to even greater environmental harm, however, because methane is an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide is.\nWhy is all this methane being wasted, when at the same time natural gas is touted as an important \u201cbridge\u201d fuel as the world steers away from fossil fuels, and is the centerpiece of the so-called shale-gas revolution? The answer, as the saying goes in the real estate business, is simple: location, location, location.\n[2]: Methane Capture and Use\nYou've probably heard about the three R's. While it's important to reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as you can, it's hard to avoid throwing out some trash every week. Trash that cannot be recycled or reused often ends up in landfills, where it produces methane as it decomposes.\nMethane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. One pound of methane traps 25 times more heat in the atmosphere than a pound of carbon dioxide. Methane is also the main ingredient in natural gas. Because methane can be captured from landfills, it can be burned to produce electricity, heat buildings, or power garbage trucks. Capturing methane before it gets into the atmosphere also helps reduce the effects of climate change.\nMethane can also be captured from farm digesters, which are big tanks that contain manure and other waste from barns that house livestock such as cows and pigs.\nHow It Works\n- Trash decomposes (or rots) in landfills, creating methane gas.\n[3]: How Methane Emissions Contribute to Climate Change\nThe United States and the European Union announced a new pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, with the intention that many more major emitters will join on in the lead up to the annual climate conference in Glasgow later this year. For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.\n[4]: Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), with a global warming potential (GWP) around 28 times greater than the same mass of carbon dioxide emissions on a 100-year basis, and over 80 times more powerful on a 20-year basis. This makes methane second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.\nWhile methane has a significantly higher GWP than carbon dioxide, it also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, and so after about 12 years, the methane in the atmosphere breaks down into GHGs with a lower GWP. In contrast, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for over a century.\nAs a result, the rapid reduction of methane emissions is:\none of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change,\ncritical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels; and\nprobably the single most important climate action we can undertake in the short-term.\n[5]: Reducing Methane Emissions in the Global Food System\nReducing Methane Emissions in the Global Food System\nSponsored by:\nAgriculture & food systems under the microscope\nThe 2022 UN climate change negotiations in Egypt (COP 27) saw food and agriculture take center-stage, product of a growing awareness of its role as both a driver, and victim of, global warming. Side events and pavilions hammered home the message that food systems matter.\nThe previous year, COP-26 in Scotland was the springboard for the Global Methane Pledge, in which nations agreed to work together to cut methane emissions 30% by 2030. As of this writing, more than 150 nations have signed the pledge, which applies to all anthropogenic methane emissions sources\u2014including agriculture and the food system. COP-28, in Dubai at the end of 2023, is expected to focus on this theme and to feature a roadmap for reducing food and agriculture emissions so that climate change can be limited to 1.5\u00b0C warming.\n[6]: You can download our complete Our World in Data CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions database.\nMany of us want an overview of how our country is doing in reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.

Landfills are responsible for producing 33% of methane emissions in Venezuela, 27% in Turkmenistan, and 28% in Iraq. However, these countries often lack proper waste management systems, which results in methane being released into the atmosphere. This highlights the need for improved waste management infrastructure to capture and utilize methane gas.\n\nFurthermore, a lack of funding and resources poses a significant barrier to reducing methane emissions in these countries. For instance, implementing technologies such as biogas digesters, which can capture methane emissions from livestock manure, can be costly. Without adequate funding and resources, it becomes challenging for these countries to invest in these technologies and reduce their emissions.\n\nLimited access to advanced technologies is another barrier that these countries face. Many of the technologies available to reduce methane emissions, such as biogas digesters or landfill gas capture systems, require a certain level of infrastructure and expertise. This can be a challenge for countries with limited resources and technological advancements.\n\nIn conclusion, the main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions are a lack of proper waste management systems, inadequate funding and resources, and limited access to advanced technologies. Addressing these barriers is crucial for these countries to improve their methane management practices and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change."}], "created": 1726565477, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 1588, "total_tokens": 1929}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.\n[3]: As global temperatures continue to rise and physical climate hazards become increasingly frequent and intense, more and more organizations are committing to lower their greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Carbon dioxide commands much of their attention, but methane emissions from human activity are the second-largest driver of global warming, accounting for roughly 30 percent of the temperature increase from preindustrial levels. Curbing emissions of methane, therefore, will be critical to solving the net-zero equation\u2014that is, reducing GHG emissions as much as possible, and counterbalancing any remaining emissions with GHG removals\u2014and stabilizing the climate.\n[4]: Construction Tips, News & Best Practices\nNowadays, the whole industry is talking about new technologies and the need for innovations. Improving existing processes is extremely important, but we cannot consider it without mentioning the main aspect - the cost of implementing innovations. Let\u2019s discuss pros and cons!

Especially now, during coronavirus pandemic, fast adaptation can be even more crucial than before. However, the case of new technology and its implementation would not be complete if we did not mention the most significant aspect of every investment - the cost.\nWhen it comes to the cost, we should highlight three main categories.\nMoney\n[5]: In today\u2019s fast-changing digital age, it\u2019s vital for businesses to adopt digital transformation. This process goes beyond using new technology. It\u2019s about completely changing how a company operates to succeed in a digital environment. For those running or starting a business, understanding the costs of digital transformation in 2024 is a necessary first step.\nRecent data shows a big rise in digital spending. For example, Gartner predicts global IT spending will hit $4.5 trillion in 2024. This shows just how critical digital transformation is becoming.\nThis article will explain these costs and the benefits DT brings. We\u2019ll examine why digital transformation is crucial to your business\u2019s future.\nHow Much Do Companies Spend on Digital Transformation?\nTo begin with, spending on digital transformation is not a one-size-fits-all scenario.

According to the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, some of the key methane emission sources in the industry include leakages from oil and gas wells, storage tanks, and compressors. To reduce these emissions, technologies such as vapor recovery units, low-bleed pneumatics, and leak detection and repair programs can be implemented. However, the cost and effectiveness of these technologies vary depending on the specific source and situation.\n\nFor example, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that implementing leak detection and repair programs on well sites can reduce methane emissions by 75-85%, with an estimated cost of $1,200-$3,000 per well. On the other hand, investing in a vapor recovery unit for storage tanks can result in a 95% reduction in methane emissions, but can cost up to $150,000 per tank. Therefore, it is important for companies to assess their specific emission sources and goals to determine the most cost-effective technology for their operations.\n\nIn terms of the benefits of reducing methane emissions, a report by the International Energy Agency estimated that implementing cost-effective methane mitigation measures could save the industry $50 billion by 2025. Additionally, reducing methane emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential over 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\n\nHowever, there are barriers to implementing these technologies, particularly in countries with high methane emissions such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. These barriers can include a lack of infrastructure and resources, as well as regulatory challenges. This is where international support and policy incentives or penalties can play a role in promoting and incentivizing methane reduction efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the costs of digital transformation in the oil and gas industry, including the adoption of new technologies for methane reduction, are significant. A report by Gartner predicts global IT spending in the industry to reach $4.5 trillion in 2024.

The ambitious action plan outlined how the United States will leverage all available tools to tackle super-polluting methane emissions \u2013 a major contributor to climate change \u2013 while protecting public health, promoting U.S. innovation in new technologies, and helping employ thousands of skilled workers across the country.\nToday, the Biden Administration is announcing new actions in line with the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan to tackle methane emissions and support a clean energy economy, including:\n[3]: Highlights\nAbout the Global Methane Pledge\nMethane is a powerful but short-lived climate pollutant that accounts for a third of net warming since the Industrial Revolution. Rapidly reducing methane emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste can achieve near-term gains in our efforts in this decade for decisive action and is regarded as the single most effective strategy to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u02daC within reach while yielding co-benefits, including improving public health and agricultural productivity.\nThe Global Methane Pledge (GMP) was launched at COP26 by the European Union and the United States who have been joined by many countries. In March 2024, GMP counted 158 participants.\n[4]: Cite report\nIEA (2024), Global Methane Tracker 2024, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2024, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nTracking pledges, targets and action\nAchieving all methane pledges made by countries and companies would cut emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030\nThe number of companies and countries making commitments to cut methane emissions rose again in 2023. The main vehicles for such commitments were the Global Methane Pledge (GMP), updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), and national methane action plans. Some took concrete steps towards the introduction of new regulations and requirements on methane, including the United States, Canada and the European Union. These announcements on oil and gas are particularly notable since they broadly align with the reductions required in the IEA\u2019s NZE Scenario.\n[5]: Benefits and costs of mitigating methane emissions Global Methane Assessment key findings Share SHARE Facebook share Twitter LinkedIn Copy URL Email Breadcrumb Home Tools & resources CCAC assessments Global Methane Assessment Reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest, most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Global action to reduce methane emissions has additional benefits for human health, food security and ecosystems, as it can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant with multiple harmful impacts. As human-caused methane emissions continue to increase, there are more reasons than ever to reduce methane emissions this decade. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition and UN Environment Programme's Global Methane Assessment shows that we have the technologies and policy frameworks to do so cost effectively and with immediate benefits to society\n[6]: In Brief\nHow Cutting Methane Emissions Can Move the Needle on Climate Change\nReducing global emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, could provide one quick win in the fight against climate change.\nCutting methane emissions is a cost-effective and relatively quick way to limit global temperature rise, according to a new United Nations\u2013backed report.\nOnly in the past decade have scientists been able to estimate the amount and sources of these emissions, allowing a greater understanding of the difference reducing methane pollution can make for climate change.\nHow do methane emissions contribute to climate change?\nMore on:\nMethane is one of several greenhouse gases, which trap the sun\u2019s heat in the atmosphere and thus cause the global average temperature to rise. Accounting for about 20 percent of global emissions, methane is the second-most-prevalent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, which makes up more than 70 percent.\n\nNow give your response.

This is evident in initiatives such as the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched at COP26 by the European Union and the United States and has since been joined by numerous other countries. The pledge aims to leverage the reduction of methane emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste as a way to achieve near-term gains in the global effort to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u02daC.\n\nIn addition to the ethical responsibility of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship, there are also economic incentives for countries to improve their methane management practices. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that achieving all methane pledges made by countries and companies would cut emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030. This could lead to economic savings from reduced emissions and the potential for captured methane to be used as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs.\n\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that need to be overcome in order for countries to effectively reduce methane emissions. This is where international support mechanisms can play a crucial role. The Biden administration, for example, has announced new actions to support the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, including $1.15B from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create jobs capping wells. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Methane Assessment shows that there are existing technologies and policy frameworks that can be implemented cost-effectively and with immediate benefits to society.\n\nIt is also important to consider the human angle in this issue. Local communities living near sources of methane emissions are disproportionately affected by air pollution and can benefit from improved air quality. This provides an emotionally compelling narrative and highlights the importance of addressing methane emissions for the well-being of communities.\n\nIn conclusion, there are various international support mechanisms and incentives that can help countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to methane emission management.

As we know, methane emissions are a major contributor to global warming and addressing them is crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change. When it comes to countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, there are several key infrastructural and financial challenges that they face in implementing methane capture and reduction technologies in their oil and gas sectors.\n\nOne of the main challenges is the lack of necessary infrastructure to capture and transport methane. This can be attributed to the fact that these countries have long relied on flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas. Flaring, however, releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere and contributes to the overall emissions. Building the necessary infrastructure for capturing and transporting methane requires significant investment, which can be a financial barrier for these countries.\n\nIn addition, there may be political and economic factors at play that hinder the adoption of methane reduction technologies. For example, in Venezuela, the current economic crisis and political instability may make it difficult to prioritize investing in new technologies for reducing methane emissions. In Turkmenistan, the government's control over the oil and gas sector may make it challenging for private companies to invest in new technologies.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of technical expertise and knowledge in these countries. Implementing new technologies for methane reduction requires trained professionals and specialized equipment, which may not be readily available. This can further increase the cost and complexity of adopting these technologies.\n\nFurthermore, there may be regulatory barriers that hinder progress in reducing methane emissions. In some cases, the lack of regulations or enforcement may not incentivize companies to invest in reducing their methane emissions. In others, strict regulations may make it difficult for companies to comply, especially if they do not have the necessary resources and expertise.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there have been recent efforts to address these challenges. For example, the Biden-Harris administration in the United States has announced new rules and regulations to cut methane emissions and provide incentives for companies to invest in reducing their emissions. These efforts can serve as an example for other countries, and international support and partnerships can play a crucial role in helping countries overcome the infrastructural and financial challenges they face.\n\nIn conclusion, the key challenges faced by countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq in implementing methane capture and reduction technologies in their oil and gas sectors include infrastructural limitations, financial barriers, political and economic factors, lack of technical expertise, and regulatory barriers.

The energy sector \u2013 including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy \u2013 accounts for over a third of methane emissions from human activity. The IEA\u2019s Global Methane Tracker is an indispensable tool in the fight to bring down emissions from across the energy sector.\n[2]: CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts \u2013 Observed methane releases from global oil and gas operations are 30 per cent higher than what countries estimate in reports to the United Nations, according to a new study that analysed satellite observations of the potent greenhouse gas.\nThe world\u2019s four largest oil and gas emitters, the United States, Russia, Venezuela and Turkmenistan, account for most of the overall discrepancy, according to the report published in August in Nature Communications.\nThe satellite data challenges figures reported to the UN, which rely on so-called emissions factors \u2013 estimates for how much methane equipment might normally release \u2013 applied to production and use rates.\nThe real-world data recorded by satellites suggests those estimates are way too low. The authors used a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to model and estimate emissions for most of the world with fossil fuel production by using 22 months of detections from the European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-5P satellite.\n[3]: How Methane Emissions Contribute to Climate Change\nThe United States and the European Union announced a new pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, with the intention that many more major emitters will join on in the lead up to the annual climate conference in Glasgow later this year. For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.\n[4]: Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), with a global warming potential (GWP) around 28 times greater than the same mass of carbon dioxide emissions on a 100-year basis, and over 80 times more powerful on a 20-year basis. This makes methane second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.\nWhile methane has a significantly higher GWP than carbon dioxide, it also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, and so after about 12 years, the methane in the atmosphere breaks down into GHGs with a lower GWP. In contrast, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for over a century.\nAs a result, the rapid reduction of methane emissions is:\none of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change,\ncritical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels; and\nprobably the single most important climate action we can undertake in the short-term.\n[5]: China was the world's largest methane emitter in 2020, with 1.19 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO\u2082e). The United States and India followed, with methane emissions of 751 and 699 MtCO\u2082e, respectively.

So far, 196 countries ratified or otherwise joined the Paris Climate Agreement, representing more than 96% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, 57 countries \u2014 including United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and Mexico \u2014 also developed long-term plans to decarbonize their economies.\n[7]: Cite report\nIEA (2024), Global Methane Tracker 2024, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2024, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nKey findings\nMethane emissions from the energy sector remained near a record high in 2023\nWe estimate that the production and use of fossil fuels resulted in close to 120 million tonnes (Mt) of methane emissions in 2023, while a further 10 Mt came from bioenergy \u2013 largely stemming from the traditional use of biomass. Emissions have remained around this level since 2019, when they reached a record high. Since fossil fuel supply has continued to expand since then, this indicates that the average methane intensity of production globally has declined marginally during this period.\nThe latest IEA Global Methane Tracker is based on the most recently available data on methane emissions from the energy sector and incorporates new scientific studies, measurement campaigns, and information collected from satellites.\n\nNow give your response.

This indicates that these countries have a significant impact on global methane levels and their efforts to reduce methane emissions would greatly contribute to climate change mitigation. The report also highlights that these countries can benefit economically from improving their methane management practices, by using captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports and reduced domestic energy costs.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the excessive methane emissions in these countries is the lack of proper infrastructural and technological capabilities to manage methane. A study published in Nature Communications analyzed satellite observations and found that the actual methane releases from global oil and gas operations are 30% higher than what is estimated by these countries in their reports to the United Nations. This discrepancy is mainly due to the use of emissions factors, which are often lower than the actual amount of methane being released.\n\nAside from economic benefits, there is also the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is especially important as the United States and the European Union have recently announced a pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. This pledge sets the minimum requirement for countries to curb this dangerous climate pollutant, highlighting the importance of reducing methane emissions.\n\nIn order to address this issue, there is a need for international support and policy incentives or penalties. The IEA's Global Methane Tracker also suggests that the average methane intensity of production globally has declined marginally in recent years, indicating that there has been progress in reducing methane emissions. However, more efforts and support are needed to further reduce these emissions.\n\nThe human angle of this topic could also be explored, focusing on the local communities affected by methane emissions and how improved air quality can enhance their quality of life. This could provide an emotionally compelling narrative and resonate with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the infrastructural and regulatory barriers that prevent the adoption of methane mitigation technologies in Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq include the lack of proper capabilities, the use of lower emissions factors, and the need for international support and incentives. However, with the increasing global focus on reducing methane emissions, it is important for these countries to address these barriers and work towards a more sustainable future.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, today\u2019s concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are higher than at any time in at least 800 000 years, and methane has contributed around 30% of observed global warming to date.\nMethane emissions from the global energy sector rebounded by almost 5% in 2021\n[3]: About this report\nMethane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality. The energy sector \u2013 including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy \u2013 accounts for over a third of methane emissions from human activity. The IEA\u2019s Global Methane Tracker is an indispensable tool in the fight to bring down emissions from across the energy sector.\n[4]: Cite report\nIEA (2022), Global Methane Tracker 2022, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nThe Global Methane Pledge\nThe Global Methane Pledge was launched at COP26 in November 2021 to catalyse action to reduce methane emissions.

Sources information from \"Environmental economics,\" \"Economy of Turkmenistan,\" and \"Carbon price.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Could you please explain how methane emissions are currently impacting the economies of countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Methane emissions from oil and gas production have been a major problem for countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, Iraq alone is responsible for around eight percent of global methane emissions, despite only accounting for three percent of global oil and gas production . This wasted gas is estimated to be worth USD 1.5 billion, highlighting the economic impact of uncontrolled methane emissions.\nHowever, countries like Iraq are now taking steps to address this issue. In 2020, the Iraq Ministry of Health and Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme co-hosted a virtual seminar where they announced the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to better understand and mitigate methane emissions from the country's oil and gas sector . This not only shows a commitment to reducing emissions, but also highlights the potential economic benefits that can be gained from addressing this issue.\nSimilarly, Turkmenistan has also taken steps towards harnessing the power of methane emissions reduction. In collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme, UN Turkmenistan organized a training for Turkmen officials on strategic actions in methane management and ways to mitigate emissions . As a country with significant potential for low-cost methane reduction, Turkmenistan has a pivotal role to play in addressing climate change.\nOn a global scale, the World Bank has estimated that methane emissions contribute to over a quarter of the current global warming trend . This highlights the urgency of addressing this issue, not just for the environment, but also for economic and social reasons. In fact, as a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, Iraq is committed to collectively reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, which could have a significant impact on global methane levels and climate change mitigation .\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also lead to economic benefits. The Iraq Progresses on Fossil Fuel Methane Regulation report states that an increasing number of major oil-producing countries, including Iraq, are taking action on methane emissions as the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce the rate of warming before 2030 . Additionally, reducing methane emissions can also provide economic savings, as captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs .\nHowever, there are still challenges that these countries face in reducing methane emissions.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A8Oq3uH08PFQg5tRsznMPvlpKjb3Q", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "produce a question that focuses on the specific challenges faced by these countries.

Draws from sections like \"Methane emissions,\" \"Greenhouse gas,\" and \"Climate change mitigation.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Can you provide me with the latest data on methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, and how these figures compare to their overall gas production?\nExpert: According to the latest data from Our World in Data, the methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq are as follows:\n- Venezuela: 4.8 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 42.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Turkmenistan: 4.4 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 0.5% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 30.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Iraq: 6.7 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.6% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 56.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\nCompared to their overall gas production, these countries have excessively high methane emissions. For example, Turkmenistan's methane emissions are more than the entire carbon emissions of the UK, according to data from the French energy and environmental geo-analytics company Kayrros for the Guardian. This is a major concern for climate change mitigation efforts.\nHowever, addressing these emissions could provide substantial economic benefits for these countries. Methane can be captured and used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. Furthermore, reducing methane emissions can also improve air quality, thus enhancing the quality of life for local communities.\nIt is important to acknowledge the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is a topic that resonates with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility. Research should delve into the existing infrastructural and technological barriers these countries face in reducing methane emissions and how international support can play a role. Additionally, policy incentives or penalties could potentially alter their economic strategies and relationships on the global stage.\nIn conclusion, the latest data clearly shows that Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions compared to their gas production. Addressing these emissions not only has economic benefits, but it also has an ethical and human impact. It is important for these countries to prioritize improving their methane management practices and for the international community to offer support in this effort.

Utilizes information from \"Energy policy,\" \"International environmental agreement,\" and \"Environmental policy.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Can you provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Sure, let me provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. According to a recent news article, methane emissions contribute to about one third of current global warming, and it has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide. This has led to increased efforts from major emitters, including the United States and the European Union, to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030.\nIn terms of economic impact, methane emissions can have both negative and positive effects. On the negative side, methane leaks can pose explosion hazards and affect air quality, which can have detrimental effects on local communities. However, on the positive side, reducing methane emissions can lead to economic savings.\nOne potential economic benefit is the use of captured methane as a clean energy source, which can potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. This is supported by the Global Methane Assessment, which states that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also have additional benefits for human health, food security, and ecosystems. The report highlights that reducing methane emissions can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, and have immediate benefits to society.\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that these countries may face in reducing methane emissions. This can be seen in the United States, which had the world's highest methane emissions from oil and gas production in 2022. This highlights the need for international support and cooperation to help these countries overcome these barriers.\nIn terms of policy incentives or penalties, there are already efforts in place to incentivize countries to reduce their methane emissions. For instance, the report by the International Energy Agency states that the reduction of methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change and is critical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. This can potentially lead to changes in economic strategies and relationships on the global stage for countries with high methane emissions.\nIn conclusion, reducing methane emissions not only has economic benefits but also has ethical implications in terms of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A8Oq50ZyffmXFIKEpT9c2SYhobmxv", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "understand the specific methods and technologies that are available or in development to address methane emissions.

Utilizes information from \"Energy policy,\" \"International environmental agreement,\" and \"Environmental policy.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Can you provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Sure, let me provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. According to a recent news article, methane emissions contribute to about one third of current global warming, and it has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide. This has led to increased efforts from major emitters, including the United States and the European Union, to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030.\nIn terms of economic impact, methane emissions can have both negative and positive effects. On the negative side, methane leaks can pose explosion hazards and affect air quality, which can have detrimental effects on local communities. However, on the positive side, reducing methane emissions can lead to economic savings.\nOne potential economic benefit is the use of captured methane as a clean energy source, which can potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. This is supported by the Global Methane Assessment, which states that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also have additional benefits for human health, food security, and ecosystems. The report highlights that reducing methane emissions can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, and have immediate benefits to society.\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that these countries may face in reducing methane emissions. This can be seen in the United States, which had the world's highest methane emissions from oil and gas production in 2022. This highlights the need for international support and cooperation to help these countries overcome these barriers.\nIn terms of policy incentives or penalties, there are already efforts in place to incentivize countries to reduce their methane emissions. For instance, the report by the International Energy Agency states that the reduction of methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change and is critical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. This can potentially lead to changes in economic strategies and relationships on the global stage for countries with high methane emissions.\nIn conclusion, reducing methane emissions not only has economic benefits but also has ethical implications in terms of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship.\nYou: What specific methods and technologies are currently available or in development for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector?\nExpert: Based on research and reports from the IEA, UN, and the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, there are several proven methods and technologies currently available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. These include:\n1. Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs: These programs use advanced technologies such as infrared cameras and optical gas imaging to identify and repair leaks in pipelines and equipment.\n2. Vapor recovery units (VRUs): These units capture and recycle methane emissions from oil storage tanks, reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.\n3. Reduced emission completions (RECs): This method involves using special equipment and processes during the well completion phase to minimize methane emissions from newly drilled wells.\n4. Methane detectors: These devices are used to monitor and detect methane leaks in real-time, allowing for immediate action to be taken.\n5. Methane capture and utilization: This involves capturing methane emissions and using it as a clean energy source, either for on-site operations or for sale.\nWhile these technologies and methods are readily available, there are still infrastructural and technological barriers in certain countries, as well as the need for international support and policy incentives to encourage their implementation. However, the economic benefits of reducing methane emissions, such as increased exports and reduced energy costs, could provide the necessary motivation for countries to invest in these technologies. In addition to economic benefits, there is also the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility, which could resonate with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility.

Sources information from \"Environmental economics,\" \"Economy of Turkmenistan,\" and \"Carbon price.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Could you please explain how methane emissions are currently impacting the economies of countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Methane emissions from oil and gas production have been a major problem for countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, Iraq alone is responsible for around eight percent of global methane emissions, despite only accounting for three percent of global oil and gas production . This wasted gas is estimated to be worth USD 1.5 billion, highlighting the economic impact of uncontrolled methane emissions.\nHowever, countries like Iraq are now taking steps to address this issue. In 2020, the Iraq Ministry of Health and Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme co-hosted a virtual seminar where they announced the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to better understand and mitigate methane emissions from the country's oil and gas sector . This not only shows a commitment to reducing emissions, but also highlights the potential economic benefits that can be gained from addressing this issue.\nSimilarly, Turkmenistan has also taken steps towards harnessing the power of methane emissions reduction. In collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme, UN Turkmenistan organized a training for Turkmen officials on strategic actions in methane management and ways to mitigate emissions . As a country with significant potential for low-cost methane reduction, Turkmenistan has a pivotal role to play in addressing climate change.\nOn a global scale, the World Bank has estimated that methane emissions contribute to over a quarter of the current global warming trend . This highlights the urgency of addressing this issue, not just for the environment, but also for economic and social reasons. In fact, as a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, Iraq is committed to collectively reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, which could have a significant impact on global methane levels and climate change mitigation .\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also lead to economic benefits. The Iraq Progresses on Fossil Fuel Methane Regulation report states that an increasing number of major oil-producing countries, including Iraq, are taking action on methane emissions as the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce the rate of warming before 2030 . Additionally, reducing methane emissions can also provide economic savings, as captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs .\nHowever, there are still challenges that these countries face in reducing methane emissions.\nYou: What are the main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions?\nExpert: The main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions are a lack of proper waste management systems, inadequate funding and resources, and limited access to advanced technologies.\nAccording to the Environmental Defense Fund, the most significant source of methane emissions in these countries is landfills. Landfills are responsible for producing 33% of methane emissions in Venezuela, 27% in Turkmenistan, and 28% in Iraq. However, these countries often lack proper waste management systems, which results in methane being released into the atmosphere. This highlights the need for improved waste management infrastructure to capture and utilize methane gas.\nFurthermore, a lack of funding and resources poses a significant barrier to reducing methane emissions in these countries. For instance, implementing technologies such as biogas digesters, which can capture methane emissions from livestock manure, can be costly. Without adequate funding and resources, it becomes challenging for these countries to invest in these technologies and reduce their emissions.\nLimited access to advanced technologies is another barrier that these countries face. Many of the technologies available to reduce methane emissions, such as biogas digesters or landfill gas capture systems, require a certain level of infrastructure and expertise. This can be a challenge for countries with limited resources and technological advancements.\nIn conclusion, the main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions are a lack of proper waste management systems, inadequate funding and resources, and limited access to advanced technologies. Addressing these barriers is crucial for these countries to improve their methane management practices and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A8OqHthj91f8dj0QkBDVkS3ICEKlo", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "produce the question.

Draws from sections like \"Methane emissions,\" \"Greenhouse gas,\" and \"Climate change mitigation.\"\n\nConversation history:\nYou: Can you provide me with the latest data on methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, and how these figures compare to their overall gas production?\nExpert: According to the latest data from Our World in Data, the methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq are as follows:\n- Venezuela: 4.8 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 42.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Turkmenistan: 4.4 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 0.5% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 30.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Iraq: 6.7 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.6% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 56.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\nCompared to their overall gas production, these countries have excessively high methane emissions. For example, Turkmenistan's methane emissions are more than the entire carbon emissions of the UK, according to data from the French energy and environmental geo-analytics company Kayrros for the Guardian. This is a major concern for climate change mitigation efforts.\nHowever, addressing these emissions could provide substantial economic benefits for these countries. Methane can be captured and used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. Furthermore, reducing methane emissions can also improve air quality, thus enhancing the quality of life for local communities.\nIt is important to acknowledge the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is a topic that resonates with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility. Research should delve into the existing infrastructural and technological barriers these countries face in reducing methane emissions and how international support can play a role. Additionally, policy incentives or penalties could potentially alter their economic strategies and relationships on the global stage.\nIn conclusion, the latest data clearly shows that Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions compared to their gas production. Addressing these emissions not only has economic benefits, but it also has an ethical and human impact. It is important for these countries to prioritize improving their methane management practices and for the international community to offer support in this effort. As the saying goes, \"we do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.\" It is our responsibility to find a balance between economic gains and environmental responsibility for a sustainable future.\nYou: What current technologies are available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, and how cost-effective are they?\nExpert: The technologies available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry vary in cost and effectiveness. According to the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, some of the key methane emission sources in the industry include leakages from oil and gas wells, storage tanks, and compressors. To reduce these emissions, technologies such as vapor recovery units, low-bleed pneumatics, and leak detection and repair programs can be implemented. However, the cost and effectiveness of these technologies vary depending on the specific source and situation.\nFor example, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that implementing leak detection and repair programs on well sites can reduce methane emissions by 75-85%, with an estimated cost of $1,200-$3,000 per well. On the other hand, investing in a vapor recovery unit for storage tanks can result in a 95% reduction in methane emissions, but can cost up to $150,000 per tank. Therefore, it is important for companies to assess their specific emission sources and goals to determine the most cost-effective technology for their operations.\nIn terms of the benefits of reducing methane emissions, a report by the International Energy Agency estimated that implementing cost-effective methane mitigation measures could save the industry $50 billion by 2025. Additionally, reducing methane emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential over 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\nHowever, there are barriers to implementing these technologies, particularly in countries with high methane emissions such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. These barriers can include a lack of infrastructure and resources, as well as regulatory challenges. This is where international support and policy incentives or penalties can play a role in promoting and incentivizing methane reduction efforts.\nFurthermore, the costs of digital transformation in the oil and gas industry, including the adoption of new technologies for methane reduction, are significant.

In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, Iraq alone is responsible for around eight percent of global methane emissions, despite only accounting for three percent of global oil and gas production . This wasted gas is estimated to be worth USD 1.5 billion, highlighting the economic impact of uncontrolled methane emissions.\nHowever, countries like Iraq are now taking steps to address this issue. In 2020, the Iraq Ministry of Health and Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme co-hosted a virtual seminar where they announced the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to better understand and mitigate methane emissions from the country's oil and gas sector . This not only shows a commitment to reducing emissions, but also highlights the potential economic benefits that can be gained from addressing this issue.\nSimilarly, Turkmenistan has also taken steps towards harnessing the power of methane emissions reduction. In collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme, UN Turkmenistan organized a training for Turkmen officials on strategic actions in methane management and ways to mitigate emissions . As a country with significant potential for low-cost methane reduction, Turkmenistan has a pivotal role to play in addressing climate change.\nOn a global scale, the World Bank has estimated that methane emissions contribute to over a quarter of the current global warming trend . This highlights the urgency of addressing this issue, not just for the environment, but also for economic and social reasons. In fact, as a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, Iraq is committed to collectively reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, which could have a significant impact on global methane levels and climate change mitigation .\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also lead to economic benefits. The Iraq Progresses on Fossil Fuel Methane Regulation report states that an increasing number of major oil-producing countries, including Iraq, are taking action on methane emissions as the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce the rate of warming before 2030 . Additionally, reducing methane emissions can also provide economic savings, as captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs .\nWikipedia Writer: What are the main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions?\nExpert: The main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions are a lack of proper waste management systems, inadequate funding and resources, and limited access to advanced technologies.\nAccording to the Environmental Defense Fund, the most significant source of methane emissions in these countries is landfills. Landfills are responsible for producing 33% of methane emissions in Venezuela, 27% in Turkmenistan, and 28% in Iraq. However, these countries often lack proper waste management systems, which results in methane being released into the atmosphere. This highlights the need for improved waste management infrastructure to capture and utilize methane gas.\nFurthermore, a lack of funding and resources poses a significant barrier to reducing methane emissions in these countries. For instance, implementing technologies such as biogas digesters, which can capture methane emissions from livestock manure, can be costly. Without adequate funding and resources, it becomes challenging for these countries to invest in these technologies and reduce their emissions.\nLimited access to advanced technologies is another barrier that these countries face. Many of the technologies available to reduce methane emissions, such as biogas digesters or landfill gas capture systems, require a certain level of infrastructure and expertise. This can be a challenge for countries with limited resources and technological advancements.\nIn conclusion, the main infrastructural and technological barriers that prevent countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq from effectively managing and reducing their methane emissions are a lack of proper waste management systems, inadequate funding and resources, and limited access to advanced technologies.\nWikipedia Writer: Could you describe the types of international support mechanisms that are available or being developed to help countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to methane emission management?\nExpert: The international community has recognized the importance of reducing methane emissions as a key strategy in mitigating the effects of climate change. This is evident in initiatives such as the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched at COP26 by the European Union and the United States and has since been joined by numerous other countries. The pledge aims to leverage the reduction of methane emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste as a way to achieve near-term gains in the global effort to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u02daC.\nIn addition to the ethical responsibility of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship, there are also economic incentives for countries to improve their methane management practices. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that achieving all methane pledges made by countries and companies would cut emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030. This could lead to economic savings from reduced emissions and the potential for captured methane to be used as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs.\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that need to be overcome in order for countries to effectively reduce methane emissions. This is where international support mechanisms can play a crucial role. The Biden administration, for example, has announced new actions to support the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, including $1.15B from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create jobs capping wells. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Methane Assessment shows that there are existing technologies and policy frameworks that can be implemented cost-effectively and with immediate benefits to society.\nIt is also important to consider the human angle in this issue. Local communities living near sources of methane emissions are disproportionately affected by air pollution and can benefit from improved air quality. This provides an emotionally compelling narrative and highlights the importance of addressing methane emissions for the well-being of communities.\nIn conclusion, there are various international support mechanisms and incentives that can help countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to methane emission management. These include the Global Methane Pledge, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, and national methane action plans, among others.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Sure, let me provide an overview of the economic impact of methane emissions in countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. According to a recent news article, methane emissions contribute to about one third of current global warming, and it has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide. This has led to increased efforts from major emitters, including the United States and the European Union, to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030.\nIn terms of economic impact, methane emissions can have both negative and positive effects. On the negative side, methane leaks can pose explosion hazards and affect air quality, which can have detrimental effects on local communities. However, on the positive side, reducing methane emissions can lead to economic savings.\nOne potential economic benefit is the use of captured methane as a clean energy source, which can potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. This is supported by the Global Methane Assessment, which states that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also have additional benefits for human health, food security, and ecosystems. The report highlights that reducing methane emissions can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, and have immediate benefits to society.\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that these countries may face in reducing methane emissions. This can be seen in the United States, which had the world's highest methane emissions from oil and gas production in 2022. This highlights the need for international support and cooperation to help these countries overcome these barriers.\nIn terms of policy incentives or penalties, there are already efforts in place to incentivize countries to reduce their methane emissions. For instance, the report by the International Energy Agency states that the reduction of methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change and is critical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. This can potentially lead to changes in economic strategies and relationships on the global stage for countries with high methane emissions.\nWikipedia Writer: What specific methods and technologies are currently available or in development for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector?\nExpert: Based on research and reports from the IEA, UN, and the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, there are several proven methods and technologies currently available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. These include:\n1. Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs: These programs use advanced technologies such as infrared cameras and optical gas imaging to identify and repair leaks in pipelines and equipment.\n2. Vapor recovery units (VRUs): These units capture and recycle methane emissions from oil storage tanks, reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.\n3. Reduced emission completions (RECs): This method involves using special equipment and processes during the well completion phase to minimize methane emissions from newly drilled wells.\n4. Methane detectors: These devices are used to monitor and detect methane leaks in real-time, allowing for immediate action to be taken.\n5. Methane capture and utilization: This involves capturing methane emissions and using it as a clean energy source, either for on-site operations or for sale.\nWhile these technologies and methods are readily available, there are still infrastructural and technological barriers in certain countries, as well as the need for international support and policy incentives to encourage their implementation. However, the economic benefits of reducing methane emissions, such as increased exports and reduced energy costs, could provide the necessary motivation for countries to invest in these technologies.

As we know, methane emissions are a major contributor to global warming and addressing them is crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change. When it comes to countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, there are several key infrastructural and financial challenges that they face in implementing methane capture and reduction technologies in their oil and gas sectors.\nOne of the main challenges is the lack of necessary infrastructure to capture and transport methane. This can be attributed to the fact that these countries have long relied on flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas. Flaring, however, releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere and contributes to the overall emissions. Building the necessary infrastructure for capturing and transporting methane requires significant investment, which can be a financial barrier for these countries.\nIn addition, there may be political and economic factors at play that hinder the adoption of methane reduction technologies. For example, in Venezuela, the current economic crisis and political instability may make it difficult to prioritize investing in new technologies for reducing methane emissions. In Turkmenistan, the government's control over the oil and gas sector may make it challenging for private companies to invest in new technologies.\nAnother challenge is the lack of technical expertise and knowledge in these countries. Implementing new technologies for methane reduction requires trained professionals and specialized equipment, which may not be readily available. This can further increase the cost and complexity of adopting these technologies.\nFurthermore, there may be regulatory barriers that hinder progress in reducing methane emissions. In some cases, the lack of regulations or enforcement may not incentivize companies to invest in reducing their methane emissions. In others, strict regulations may make it difficult for companies to comply, especially if they do not have the necessary resources and expertise.\nHowever, it is important to note that there have been recent efforts to address these challenges. For example, the Biden-Harris administration in the United States has announced new rules and regulations to cut methane emissions and provide incentives for companies to invest in reducing their emissions. These efforts can serve as an example for other countries, and international support and partnerships can play a crucial role in helping countries overcome the infrastructural and financial challenges they face.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide me with the latest data on methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, and how these figures compare to their overall gas production?\nExpert: According to the latest data from Our World in Data, the methane emissions for Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq are as follows:\n- Venezuela: 4.8 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 42.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Turkmenistan: 4.4 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 0.5% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 30.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n- Iraq: 6.7 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2021, a 1.6% increase from the previous year. This is equivalent to 56.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.\nCompared to their overall gas production, these countries have excessively high methane emissions. For example, Turkmenistan's methane emissions are more than the entire carbon emissions of the UK, according to data from the French energy and environmental geo-analytics company Kayrros for the Guardian. This is a major concern for climate change mitigation efforts.\nHowever, addressing these emissions could provide substantial economic benefits for these countries. Methane can be captured and used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. Furthermore, reducing methane emissions can also improve air quality, thus enhancing the quality of life for local communities.\nIt is important to acknowledge the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is a topic that resonates with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility. Research should delve into the existing infrastructural and technological barriers these countries face in reducing methane emissions and how international support can play a role. Additionally, policy incentives or penalties could potentially alter their economic strategies and relationships on the global stage.\nIn conclusion, the latest data clearly shows that Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions compared to their gas production. Addressing these emissions not only has economic benefits, but it also has an ethical and human impact. It is important for these countries to prioritize improving their methane management practices and for the international community to offer support in this effort. As the saying goes, \"we do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.\nWikipedia Writer: What current technologies are available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, and how cost-effective are they?\nExpert: The technologies available for capturing and reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry vary in cost and effectiveness. According to the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, some of the key methane emission sources in the industry include leakages from oil and gas wells, storage tanks, and compressors. To reduce these emissions, technologies such as vapor recovery units, low-bleed pneumatics, and leak detection and repair programs can be implemented. However, the cost and effectiveness of these technologies vary depending on the specific source and situation.\nFor example, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that implementing leak detection and repair programs on well sites can reduce methane emissions by 75-85%, with an estimated cost of $1,200-$3,000 per well. On the other hand, investing in a vapor recovery unit for storage tanks can result in a 95% reduction in methane emissions, but can cost up to $150,000 per tank. Therefore, it is important for companies to assess their specific emission sources and goals to determine the most cost-effective technology for their operations.\nIn terms of the benefits of reducing methane emissions, a report by the International Energy Agency estimated that implementing cost-effective methane mitigation measures could save the industry $50 billion by 2025. Additionally, reducing methane emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential over 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\nHowever, there are barriers to implementing these technologies, particularly in countries with high methane emissions such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. These barriers can include a lack of infrastructure and resources, as well as regulatory challenges. This is where international support and policy incentives or penalties can play a role in promoting and incentivizing methane reduction efforts.\nFurthermore, the costs of digital transformation in the oil and gas industry, including the adoption of new technologies for methane reduction, are significant. A report by Gartner predicts global IT spending in the industry to reach $4.5 trillion in 2024. However, investing in digital transformation and innovative technologies can lead to long-term economic and environmental benefits.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you elaborate on the specific infrastructural and regulatory barriers that prevent the adoption of methane mitigation technologies in Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: According to the Global Methane Tracker by the International Energy Agency (IEA), Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq are among the top four emitters of methane in the world, with the United States being the fourth. This indicates that these countries have a significant impact on global methane levels and their efforts to reduce methane emissions would greatly contribute to climate change mitigation. The report also highlights that these countries can benefit economically from improving their methane management practices, by using captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports and reduced domestic energy costs.\nOne of the main reasons for the excessive methane emissions in these countries is the lack of proper infrastructural and technological capabilities to manage methane. A study published in Nature Communications analyzed satellite observations and found that the actual methane releases from global oil and gas operations are 30% higher than what is estimated by these countries in their reports to the United Nations. This discrepancy is mainly due to the use of emissions factors, which are often lower than the actual amount of methane being released.\nAside from economic benefits, there is also the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is especially important as the United States and the European Union have recently announced a pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. This pledge sets the minimum requirement for countries to curb this dangerous climate pollutant, highlighting the importance of reducing methane emissions.\nIn order to address this issue, there is a need for international support and policy incentives or penalties. The IEA's Global Methane Tracker also suggests that the average methane intensity of production globally has declined marginally in recent years, indicating that there has been progress in reducing methane emissions. However, more efforts and support are needed to further reduce these emissions.\nThe human angle of this topic could also be explored, focusing on the local communities affected by methane emissions and how improved air quality can enhance their quality of life. This could provide an emotionally compelling narrative and resonate with audiences concerned about sustainable development and corporate responsibility.\nIn conclusion, the infrastructural and regulatory barriers that prevent the adoption of methane mitigation technologies in Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq include the lack of proper capabilities, the use of lower emissions factors, and the need for international support and incentives.\nWikipedia Writer: Could you provide a summary of the current data on methane emissions for the countries mentioned, focusing on Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?\nExpert: Thank you for your question. According to a recent study by the University of Washington, Turkmenistan, one of the eight countries highlighted in the document, actually saw an increase in methane emissions following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This increase is concerning, as methane is responsible for almost half of short-term warming and has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to carbon dioxide. This highlights the need for improved methane management practices in Turkmenistan and other countries to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\nThe satellite data produced by Kayrros for the Guardian also revealed that methane leaks from Turkmenistan's two main fossil fuel fields released emissions equivalent to 366 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022, which is more than the annual emissions of the UK, which is the 17th biggest emitter in the world. This emphasizes the need for urgent action to address methane emissions in countries like Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Iraq, who have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production.\nIn terms of economic benefits, reducing methane emissions can lead to significant cost savings for countries, as captured methane can be used as a clean energy source. This could potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. However, there are also ethical considerations to be made, as balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship is crucial for sustainable development and corporate responsibility.\nThere are several barriers and challenges that these countries face in reducing methane emissions, including infrastructural and technological limitations. International support and policy incentives could play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and altering economic strategies and relationships on the global stage. Furthermore, improving air quality by reducing methane emissions could also have a positive impact on local communities, enhancing their quality of life.\nIn summary, the current data on methane emissions for the countries mentioned, including Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, highlight the need for urgent action and international support to address this issue.

These solutions include improvements in leak detection and repair, implementation of methane capture and use technologies, and advancements in renewable energy sources. However, the accessibility of these solutions for the countries mentioned, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, may vary.\nFor instance, according to the 2024 Global Methane Tracker by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the production and use of fossil fuels resulted in close to 120 million tonnes of methane emissions in 2023. This indicates that the average methane intensity of production globally has declined slightly since 2019. This data suggests that there have been technological advancements in reducing methane emissions, but these may not be widely accessible to all countries.\nFurthermore, the 2022 Global Methane Tracker by IEA states that methane emissions from the global energy sector rebounded by almost 5% in 2021. This could be due to a lack of accessibility to technological solutions or barriers such as policy incentives or penalties that may affect a country's economic strategies.\nHowever, there are efforts being made to address these issues. The IEA's Global Methane Pledge, launched at COP26, aims to catalyze action to reduce methane emissions. Currently, 111 countries, responsible for 45% of global human-caused methane emissions, have pledged to reduce their emissions by 30% by 2030. This could potentially lead to increased accessibility to technological solutions for methane emission reduction for these countries.\nIn summary, there are various technological solutions available for methane emission reduction, but their accessibility may be limited for countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq.\n\nCurrent outline:\n# Introduction\n# Background\n## Global Methane Emissions\n### Sources of Methane Emissions\n### Impact on Climate Change\n## Economic Models and Environmental Responsibility\n### The Cost of Methane Emissions\n### Benefits of Reducing Methane Emissions\n# Case Studies: Countries with High Methane Emissions\n## Venezuela\n### Current Emission Levels\n### Potential Economic and Environmental Benefits\n## Turkmenistan\n### Current Emission Levels\n### Potential Economic and Environmental Benefits\n## Iraq\n### Current Emission Levels\n### Potential Economic and Environmental Benefits\n## Additional Countries\n### Overview of Emissions and Potential Benefits\n# Challenges in Reducing Methane Emissions\n## Infrastructural Barriers\n### Technology\n### Funding\n## Political and Economic Barriers\n### Policy Incentives\n### International Support and Penalties\n# Benefits of Improved Methane Management\n## Economic Benefits\n### Energy Exports\n### Reduction in Domestic Energy Costs\n## Environmental Benefits\n### Impact on Global Climate Change\n### Local Air Quality Improvements\n## Social Benefits\n### Health and Quality of Life for Local Communities\n### Ethical Considerations and Sustainable Development\n# Policy and International Response\n## Policy Incentives for Methane Management\n### Domestic Policies\n### International Agreements\n## Role of International Support\n### Technology Transfer\n### Financial Assistance\n# Conclusion\n\n\n\nWrite the Wikipedia page outline (Use \"#\" Title\" to indicate section title, \"##\" Title\" to indicate subsection title, ...):", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A8Oqj8KRFMEoV18dsSvQhv1DDIBg1", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "length", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "# Introduction\n# Background on Methane Emissions\n## The Role of Methane in Climate Change\n## Economic and Environmental Costs of Methane Emissions\n# Economic Models for Environmental Responsibility\n## Integrating Economic Growth with Environmental Stewardship\n## Case for Methane Emission Reduction: Economic and Ethical Perspectives\n# Global Methane Emissions Landscape\n## Key Sources of Methane Emissions in the Oil and Gas Sector\n### Leak Detection and Repair Technologies\n### Vapor Recovery Units and Reduced Emission Completions\n### Methane Capture and Utilization Methods\n## Impact of Methane on Global Warming and Climate Change\n# Detailed Case Studies: Countries with High Methane Emissions\n## Venezuela\n### Overview of Current Methane Emission Levels\n### Economic Impacts of Methane Emissions\n### Opportunities for Methane Management and Reduction\n## Turkmenistan\n### Overview of Current Methane Emission Levels\n### Role of International Partnerships in Methane Emission Reduction\n### Potential Economic and Environmental Benefits\n## Iraq\n### Overview of Current Methane Emission Levels\n### Infrastructural and Technological Challenges in Methane Reduction\n### Policy Initiatives and Economic Benefits of Emission Reduction\n## Additional High-Emission Countries\n### Comparative Analysis of Emission Levels and Reduction Efforts\n### Overview of International Support Mechanisms\n# Overcoming Challenges in Methane Emission Reduction\n## Infrastructural and Technological Barriers\n### Access to Advanced Technologies\n### Funding and Investment Challenges\n## Political and Economic Barriers\n### The Role of Policy Incentives and Penalties\n### Impact of International Agreements and Pledges\n# Advantages of Effective Methane Management\n## Economic Benefits\n### Enhanced Energy Exports and Reduced Energy Costs\n## Environmental and Social Benefits\n### Contributions to Mitigating Global Climate Change\n### Improvements in Local Air Quality and Community Health\n### Ethical Dimensions of Sustainable Development\n# Policy and International Initi", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565509, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 400, "prompt_tokens": 6110, "total_tokens": 6510, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Recent announcements by Canada, the European Union and the United States are broadly in line with the IEA\u2019s NZE Scenario.\n- The United States finalised new regulations in December 2023 that tighten requirements on new and modified oil and gas facilities and set guidelines for states to regulate existing sources. The new rule also establishes a first-of-its-kind Super Emitter Program that allows the government to act on emissions events detected remotely by qualified third parties, such as IMEO\u2019s Methane Alert and Response System. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the rule will reduce emissions by nearly 80% over the period from 2024 to 2038.\nAn example of this in action is the EU external energy engagement strategy, which aims to provide technical assistance to partners to deploy methane abatement technologies through a \u201cYou Collect, We Buy\u201d scheme, which the European Union announced it will pilot with Algeria. Separately, Japan and Korea announced the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement toward Net-zero (CLEAN) project, under which large purchasers of LNG will collect information from suppliers on the status of methane reduction efforts to enhance the availability of information on LNG-related emissions.\nTurning ambition into action will require active coordination and cooperation\nThere are a large number of international methane initiatives underway that look to provide support for increased action, and more are being created each year. The IEA is engaged in or affiliated with many of these efforts, which include:\n[2]\nOur broad reviews of policies and regulations reveal some success stories that other countries can look to for inspiration. The United States and Canada have both implemented key tried and tested approaches, although there is still room to strengthen their requirements and expand coverage further. Norway and the Netherlands have gone the furthest towards adopting a comprehensive regime, as they have robust measurement and reporting requirements, ensure best industry practice, and economic incentives that encourage abatement action. Actions under the EU Methane Strategy will broaden these efforts across Europe.\n[3]\nThe shared goal is a targeted reduction in global emissions, even though some of the most important players have not yet joined, including China, India and the Russian Federation. It will be critical for participants to engage with countries that have not joined the Pledge in order to achieve the overall target. There are substantial opportunities for engagement with these countries. For example, in the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration, China committed to develop a \u201ccomprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane, aiming to achieve a significant effect on methane emissions control and reductions in the 2020s.\u201d\nTop twelve emitters of methane with breakdown by sector, 2021\n[4]\nThe priority, therefore, is for action where it is practical. Many of the solutions can be implemented at a relatively low or net-negative cost, and these should be a priority. Where costs are prohibitive, there is a need for coordinated action to create the infrastructure and fiscal conditions that would support further action. Across the board, there is a need for more monitoring, reporting, and verification, more support for consumer choices, and more dedication to funding technical solutions. Without these efforts, it is likely that current initiatives will fail and the planet will continue on its collision course with an uncertain and dangerous future.\n\nThe topic of the page:\n**Balancing Oil Gains with Environmental Responsibility: A New Economic Model for Methane Emissions**\n\nThe document highlights eight countries, including Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, which have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production.

Emissions can also result from agriculture and livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the US, which is especially concerning since it is 25 percent more effective at trapping heat than CO2.\nMethane was officially added to the list of climate change priorities to address this decade by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2021. The amount of methane emitted by human activity has been underestimated in the past and emissions have surged in the past 15 years. A 2020 study by the University of Rochester found that levels of \u201cnaturally released\u201d methane reported in the atmosphere were 10 times too high, and fossil fuel-based methane is actually about 25 to 40 percent higher than scientists previously predicted.\n\u201cThe big take-home nugget for me is they said if you look at all the warming activity done by humans over the last century \u2026 carbon dioxide has contributed 0.75 degrees Celsius, while methane has contributed to 0.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d Bob Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, told PopSci in 2021.\n[2]\nMethane is the primary component of natural gas, but it can also leak from the earth during oil and coal production. The potent greenhouse gas has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere. Curbing releases of the gas could do more to slow climate change than almost any other single measure.\nFour of the 10 largest oil and gas methane emitters identified in the report \u2013 the US, Canada, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia \u2013 have signed the Global Methane Pledge, which targets a 30 per cent reduction in global emissions of the gas by the end of this decade from 2020 levels.\nIf methane generated from human activity is responsible for a larger share of the world\u2019s total emissions, including from natural sources, then a 30 per cent cut from that activity would have a bigger effect on overall methane concentrations, according to Prof Jacob.\n[3]\nCite report\nIEA (2023), Global Methane Tracker 2023, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2023, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nUnderstanding methane emissions\nMethane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term warming and improving air quality.\nTwo key characteristics determine the impact of different greenhouse gases on the climate: the length of time they remain in the atmosphere and their ability to absorb energy. Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 around 12 years compared with centuries \u2013 but absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere.\nMethane also affects air quality because it can lead to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, a dangerous pollutant. Methane leaks can also pose explosion hazards.\nAtmospheric concentrations of methane are on the rise\nWith fossil fuels, methane emissions can occur at any point during production, processing and transport. In addition to these emissions, we include emissions from the end use of coal, oil products and natural gas in the Global Methane Tracker (3 Mt or 3% of energy-related methane). This estimate is based on the emissions factors published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for energy consumption in homes, industries and in the transport sector. Some measurement campaigns have suggested that these emissions factors could significantly underestimate actual emissions across different end-use environments, including in industry, cities and households. These are areas with very high levels of uncertainty and our estimates will continue to be updated as the evidence base grows.\n[4]\nMethane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is more potent than carbon dioxide and responsible for approximately one third of the warming from greenhouse gases occurring today. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States. Quick reduction of these methane emissions is one of the most important and cost-effective actions the United States can take in the short term to slow the rate of rapidly rising global temperatures.\nEPA issued a final rule in December 2023 to sharply reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollution from new and existing oil and gas operations. In addition, EPA is working to implement the three-part framework of the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\n[5]\nWhile methane and CO2 have similar warming effects, they are contrasting in several aspects. Methane stays in the atmosphere for just a decade, compared with the centuries-long persistence of CO2, but traps many times more heat. Methane emissions are much more irregular, emitted intermittently from oil wells, cattle, landfills, and coal mines.6 Another challenge is that sources of methane emissions are highly dispersed across and within the five industries that account for the majority of methane emissions from human activities (Exhibit 2). Agriculture creates 40 to 50 percent of global methane emissions, but these emissions come from millions of farms of different sizes and farming practices around the world.\n[6]\nNews\nCarbon dioxide is the usual villain in the climate change story. Emitted largely through the use of fossil fuels, it not only warms the planet now, but will continue to do so for more than a century while it remains in the atmosphere.\nLess well known is the role that another greenhouse gas\u2014methane\u2014plays. About one third of global methane emissions occur naturally, mostly from wetlands. But two-thirds are caused by human activity, including from oil and gas operations, coal mining, landfills, plus livestock and rice paddies. And because of its chemical composition, methane has a much higher global-warming potential than carbon dioxide does\u2014up to 80 times as much\u2014and is responsible for about a third of current global warming. But crucially, methane lingers in the atmosphere for much less time than carbon dioxide does\u2014only about 10\u201320 years.\n[7]\n\u201cCutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years and complements necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide,\u201d says Inger Andersen, executive director of United Nations Environment Program. She adds that international cooperation is an absolute.\nThe UN report says that, globally, methane emissions are on the rise once again: agriculture is responsible for 40% of those releases. Fossil fuels, comparatively, contribute 35% while landfills make up 20%. The fossil fuel sector is ripe for change because the current technologies to limit escaping methane now exist \u2014 something that could take a bite out of rising temperatures. Notably, methane is 84 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year time period.\n[8]\n*All US dollar amounts are based on 2005 equivalent value\nThe current level of investment is inadequate. Reducing methane emissions and limiting climate change with this study\u2019s selected innovations is estimated to total roughly $608 billion between now and 2035, and $1.54 trillion by 2050, implying a need for an average increase in annual spending of $55 billion per year by 2035 and $80 billion per year by mid-century.\nInvesting in dissemination, RD&D and commercializing food system methane innovations could bring up twelve times larger benefits by 2050 through reducing the costs of the energy and land transition.\nIn comparison, total annual investments in targeted food system methane measures and alternative proteins are in the range of an estimated $10-$20 billion, falling well short of the major ramp-up needed to fully unlock the sector\u2019s diverse benefits:\n-\n[9]\n. Key findings: EMISSIONS ARE INCREASING The atmospheric concentration of methane has more than doubled since pre-industrial times. Methane is second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) in driving climate change. More than half of global methane emissions stem from human activities in three sectors: fossil fuels (35% of human-caused emissions), waste (20%) and agriculture (40%). Image Image Mitigation potential in different sectors varies between countries and regions. The majority of the major abatement potentials can be achieved at low cost, less than US$ 600 per tonne of methane, especially in the waste sector and coal subsector in most regions and the oil and gas subsector in North America. OPPORTUNITIES TO ACT NOW Image The relatively short atmospheric lifetime of methane, combined with its strong warming potential, means that actions to reduce emissions can provide benefits within a few decades\n[10]\nMethane abatement in the fossil fuel industry is one of the most pragmatic and lowest cost options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technologies and measures to prevent emissions are well known and have already been deployed successfully around the world. Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023.

This system aims to identify major emissions events, activate its partners to notify relevant stakeholders, and support and track progress toward mitigation. Satellites detected more than 500 very large leaks from fossil fuel operations in 20 countries. A small portion of these were from coal, likely because coal mine methane emissions are often diffuse and therefore harder to detect.\nSatellite-detected large leaks from fossil fuel operations, 2022\nOpenSatellites are providing a major boost to our understanding of emissions\nThe growing evidence base and the International Methane Emissions Observatory\nIncomplete information about actual emissions levels and a lack of awareness of the cost-effectiveness of abatement is a key barrier to reducing methane emissions. In response, a growing number of recent initiatives aim to measure and report current and historical emissions from facilities, production types and countries. Yet these assessments remain incomplete \u2013 most countries and regions still have little or no measurement-based data and the data they provide often require careful processing. These gaps highlight the need for robust and transparent data evaluation and harmonisation of estimates.\nMethane leaks can occur along the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain and there is increasing evidence that they could be a small but important source of emissions. Leaks can occur at liquefaction facilities from gas service valves, reciprocating compressors, pump seals or metering equipment as well as during the transfer of LNG from the facility to the ship. During shipping, methane leaks can also occur if \u201cboil-off\u201d gas (a small fraction of the LNG cargo that evaporates) is vented or is used as propulsion and not fully combusted in the ship\u2019s engines.\nNew technology development has allowed satellites to detect methane emissions in offshore areas for the first time in 2022, but this has not yet become part of routine monitoring efforts, and there is still a high degree of uncertainty over estimates derived from satellite readings of emissions from offshore events. Emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were one of the first offshore leaks to be quantified using satellite data.

They also enable regional estimates of total methane emissions over longer periods of time.\nNew satellites are being developed that will provide higher resolution, greater coverage, and have more sensitive detection thresholds. These include instruments such as GHGSat, EnMAP, Carbon Mapper, SBG, CHIME and EMIT and MethaneSAT that aim to deliver high-resolution images for selected high-priority areas. These will improve methane quantification capabilities, raise public awareness and support regulatory oversight.\n[3]\n3.1 Evaluation of posterior emission estimates\nFigure 2 shows the posterior emissions, and Fig. 5 shows the posterior\u2013prior emission ratios on the 0.25\u2218 \u00d7 0.3125\u2218 grid. Also shown are the averaging kernel sensitivities (diagonal elements of the averaging kernel matrix A) that identify where the TROPOMI observations are most effective at quantifying emissions. We achieve 123 independent pieces of information (DOFS) to quantify emissions over the inversion domain. The GMM aggregates weak prior emissions mainly following spatial proximity (dictated by the similarity factors longitude and latitude). The rectilinear latitude\u2013longitude patterns in low-emitting regions reflect this aggregation. Thin lines between some of the rectilinear patterns reflect the superimposition of corrections from individual Gaussians onto the 0.25\u2218 \u00d7 0.3125\u2218 grid.\n2.2 Prior emissions\nAn implication of using lognormal error statistics for emissions is that the inversion optimizes the median (instead of the mean) of the lognormal emission PDF, but the mean can be inferred following , where is the diagonal element of the posterior error covariance matrix (Eq. 3) corresponding to that emission sate vector element (Lu et al., 2022). This is necessary when summing inversion results geographically such as to report national emissions.\n2.5 Prior and observational error covariance matrices\n., 2017, 2020) have advanced the estimation of methane emissions by additively considering the impact of management practices. H\u00f6glund-Isaksson et al. (2017) in particular simulated global oil\u2013gas emissions for 1980\u20132012 with the inclusion of country-specific parameters on associated gas flows reflecting variations in managerial decisions and arrived at closer consistency with top-down estimates. Our finding stresses the critical importance of top-down emission estimates from atmospheric observations in supporting the global stocktake and UNFCCC reporting.\nWe report optimized sector-resolved emissions for the 23 individual countries in the region. We find that TROPOMI observations can effectively constrain and individually separate emissions for most of the countries (19 out of 23). The others have small emissions. Total anthropogenic emissions in the region are 35 % higher than in the prior estimate, reflecting increases in emissions from gas (+103 %), waste (+53 %), and livestock (+49 %) but a decrease in oil (\u221214 %).\n[4]\nMethane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) and the second-biggest contributor to human-caused global warming after carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).

In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the US, which is particularly alarming given its potency; methane is 25 percent more effective at trapping heat than CO2[1]. Moreover, methane is responsible for approximately 30 percent of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution[4]. \n\n## Recent Trends and Developments\n\nIn recent years, the understanding of methane emissions has grown significantly due to advances in monitoring technologies, notably from satellites[2]. Satellites can now detect and quantify methane emissions from major leaks over large areas down to smaller leaks at the facility level[2]. New satellite technologies like GHGSat, EnMAP, Carbon Mapper, and MethaneSAT promise to deliver higher-resolution images and more sensitive detection thresholds, improving methane quantification capabilities and supporting regulatory oversight[2]. For example, emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were among the first offshore leaks quantified using satellite data, with estimates ranging between 75,000 and 230,000 tonnes of methane[2].\n\n## Economic and Environmental Implications\n\nAddressing methane emissions is not only crucial for climate change mitigation but also has significant economic implications. Countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production, and managing these emissions could yield substantial reductions in global methane levels[5]. Improved methane management practices could result in economic savings from captured methane being used as a clean energy source, potentially boosting exports or reducing domestic energy costs[5].\n\nFour of the ten largest oil and gas methane emitters, including the US, Canada, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia, have signed the Global Methane Pledge, targeting a 30 percent reduction in global emissions by the end of this decade from 2020 levels[5]. If methane generated from human activity is responsible for a larger share of the world's total emissions, including natural sources, achieving this target could have profound effects on mitigating climate change.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nDespite the potential benefits, significant challenges remain. Incomplete information about actual emissions levels and a lack of awareness of the cost-effectiveness of abatement are key barriers[2]. Moreover, infrastructural and technological barriers hinder many countries from effectively reducing methane emissions. International support, policy incentives, and technological advancements are essential to overcoming these barriers[2].\n\n## Human and Ethical Considerations\n\nBeyond economics, there is the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. Local communities affected by methane emissions often face health risks and reduced quality of life. Improved air quality resulting from better methane management could enhance their quality of life, providing an emotionally compelling narrative for sustainable development and corporate responsibility[2].\n\nIn conclusion, addressing methane emissions is a multi-faceted challenge that requires coordinated international efforts, technological innovation, and ethical considerations to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565529, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_a5d11b2ef2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 623, "prompt_tokens": 2417, "total_tokens": 3040, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

These actions can often be implemented at zero or low cost, providing significant economic benefits for governments and companies. In fact, in several cases, the actions reap cost savings after the initial investments are paid off. Many of the mitigation measures are also readily-available across all major methane emitting sectors \u2014 energy, agriculture and waste \u2014 providing an excellent solution for governments to meet climate and development goals.\nWhy is Reducing Methane Emissions Important?\nThe International Energy Agency estimates around 75% of total oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided using currently available technologies, with more than half of these reductions at zero net cost. But despite the clear economic case for sealing leaks, utilities often recoup the costs of leaked gas by passing them on to consumers. Voluntary coalitions are, however, coming together to work toward lowering methane emissions in the sector, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.\nFood Systems\nAgriculture is the largest contributor to global methane emissions, producing about 40% of these emissions, primarily from enteric fermentation (cow burps), rice cultivation and manure management.\nHow Methane Emissions Contribute to Climate Change\nThe United States and the European Union announced a new pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, with the intention that many more major emitters will join on in the lead up to the annual climate conference in Glasgow later this year. For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.\n[2]\nInvesting and deploying all of the innovations in this report to reduce methane emissions across the livestock, rice production, and food loss and waste subsectors (as described in the report), could reduce the costs of achieving a 1.5\u00b0C climate objective by as much as US$1 trillion in 2050.\nImproved air quality\nMethane emissions increase concentrations of ground-level ozone; ozone exposure is estimated to cause one million premature deaths annually from respiratory and cardiac illness. A recent UN study found that for every megaton of methane emissions reduced, approximately 1,430 premature deaths are avoided every year\u2014along with many more emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Food system methane innovations could avoid approximately 1.3 million premature deaths over the period to 2050.\nThe report takes a system-wide perspective, modeling the impact of innovations across the global economy. Its analysis described here quantifies the economic benefits of specific methane-related innovations and identifies the investment levels \u2013from research and development to commercialization\u2014needed to unlock these benefits. As the study points out, reducing methane can have many additional benefits beyond emissions reductions, including reduced air pollution, greater land conservation, and water preservation.\nThe problem of methane\nMethane (CH4) is one of the most powerful greenhouse gases\u201486 times more potent than Carbon Dioxide over a 20-year time period. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that past methane emissions from human activity account for almost a third of global warming so far.\nThe system benefits of innovation refer to the total savings and revenue generated in limiting climate change to 1.5\u00b0C warming, achieved with innovations that reduce food system emissions\u2014as opposed to relying solely on the energy system to reduce emissions. System benefits are calculated as the difference in total system costs between a 1.5\u00b0C energy system-driven scenario and a 1.5\u00b0C food system-augmented scenario. This includes revenues generated from practices and technologies that save money (such as improvements in productivity) compared to taking no action. Parameters include:\n- Total system costs: all capital, operating and fuel costs within the global energy system.\n- 1.5\u00b0C energy system-driven scenario: where a 1.5\u00b0C climate ambition is met using emissions reduction in the energy system, without relying on interventions to reduce emissions in the food system.\nIncreased public investment in agriculture extension and technology transfer, programs that provide new technologies and innovations to farmers and food producers throughout the supply chain, is also critical to the overall goal. Total investment in this critical category needs to increase by an additional $51 billion in 2025 to $224 billion by 2035 to unlock benefits of the food system innovation measures.\nInnovations drive methane emissions reductions\nThe global food and agriculture sector is diverse and accounts for a small share of global economy but plays a critical role in the lives of billions. This GINAs study identified a number of innovations in the sector that can reduce methane emissions, and then calculated the effectiveness of each innovation along with the level of investment needed\u2014all of which can be seen in the charts below.\nNet economic benefits:\nThe system benefits of innovation refer to the total savings and revenue generated in limiting climate change to 1.5\u00b0C warming, achieved with innovations that reduce food system emissions\u2014as opposed to relying solely on the energy system to reduce emissions.

Rather the chosen innovations highlight the potential scale of benefits of innovating in the food system.\nThe GINAs report projects how each of the different categories for innovations could cut methane emissions and offset costs for cutting carbon emissions. These benefits reach US$100 billion by 2030 and rapidly increase to US$1 trillion by 2050.

Generating the new technologies and techniques needed to slash methane emissions in the food and agriculture sector requires a level of spending in proportion to the importance of this goal.\n[3]\nMethane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is more potent than carbon dioxide and responsible for approximately one third of the warming from greenhouse gases occurring today. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States. Quick reduction of these methane emissions is one of the most important and cost-effective actions the United States can take in the short term to slow the rate of rapidly rising global temperatures.\nEPA issued a final rule in December 2023 to sharply reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollution from new and existing oil and gas operations. In addition, EPA is working to implement the three-part framework of the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\n[4]\nMethane is the primary component of natural gas, but it can also leak from the earth during oil and coal production. The potent greenhouse gas has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere. Curbing releases of the gas could do more to slow climate change than almost any other single measure.\nFour of the 10 largest oil and gas methane emitters identified in the report \u2013 the US, Canada, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia \u2013 have signed the Global Methane Pledge, which targets a 30 per cent reduction in global emissions of the gas by the end of this decade from 2020 levels.\nIf methane generated from human activity is responsible for a larger share of the world\u2019s total emissions, including from natural sources, then a 30 per cent cut from that activity would have a bigger effect on overall methane concentrations, according to Prof Jacob.\n[5]\nThese climate benefits are estimated using EPA\u2019s most recent analysis of the social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG), a metric that represents the monetary value of avoided climate damages associated with a decrease in emissions of a greenhouse gas. Following peer review in May 2023, EPA finalized its technical report on the updated SC-GHG estimates reflecting recent advances in the science on climate change. This report, which also addressed recommendations of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, was used to value emissions reductions in this final rule.\nOil and natural gas operations are also significant sources of other health-harming air pollutants, including smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can increase asthma attacks and other respiratory problems, as well as toxic air pollutants such as\n\nThe topic of the page:\n**Balancing Oil Gains with Environmental Responsibility: A New Economic Model for Methane Emissions**\n\nThe document highlights eight countries, including Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, which have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production.

Reducing methane emissions can, therefore, have a profound impact on slowing climate change. For example, the Global Methane Pledge aims for a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030, which could significantly mitigate climate change impacts[4].\n\n## Economic Benefits\n\nAddressing methane emissions can also result in considerable economic advantages. For instance, many mitigation measures are low-cost and provide significant economic benefits once initial investments are paid off[1]. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 75% of oil and gas methane emissions could be mitigated using existing technologies, with over half of these reductions achievable at zero net cost[1]. Additionally, deploying innovations to reduce methane emissions in agriculture and food systems could potentially reduce the cost of achieving climate targets by up to US$1 trillion by 2050[2].\n\nMoreover, captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, enhancing energy security and potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs for countries[1]. This economic benefit aligns with the broader goal of transitioning to more sustainable and resilient energy systems.\n\n## Public Health Benefits\n\nReducing methane emissions also brings substantial public health benefits. Methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is linked to severe health issues such as respiratory and cardiac illnesses[2]. It is estimated that ozone exposure results in approximately one million premature deaths annually[2]. A recent study found that for every megaton of methane emissions reduced, about 1,430 premature deaths are avoided each year, alongside numerous hospitalizations and emergency department visits[2]. Improved air quality from lower methane emissions can thus significantly enhance public health and quality of life.\n\n## Broader System Benefits\n\nInvesting in methane reduction measures across sectors, including agriculture, energy, and waste, can provide extensive system-wide benefits. Innovations in methane management not only reduce emissions but also contribute to better land conservation, water preservation, and improved agricultural productivity[2]. These comprehensive benefits underscore the importance of integrating methane management into broader environmental and economic policies.\n\nIn conclusion, effective methane management presents a multifaceted opportunity to address climate change, boost economic performance, and enhance public health, making it a critical component of sustainable development strategies worldwide.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565529, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_a5d11b2ef2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 506, "prompt_tokens": 2306, "total_tokens": 2812, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Nonetheless, we estimate that about USD 45 billion of spending in low- and middle-income countries requires particular attention, as sources of finance are likely to be more limited. To date, we estimate that external sources of finance targeted at reducing methane in the fossil fuel industry total less than USD 1 billion, although this should catalyse a far greater level of spending.\nNew tools to track emissions will bring a step change in transparency\nThere are many possible reasons why companies are not deploying these measures even though they pay for themselves. For example, the return on investment for methane abatement projects may be longer than for other investment opportunities. There may also be a lack of awareness regarding the scale of methane emissions and the cost-effectiveness of abatement. Sometimes infrastructure or institutional arrangements are inadequate, making it difficult for companies to receive the income from avoided emissions.\nRegardless of the value of captured gas, we estimate that it would be cost-effective to deploy nearly all fossil fuel methane abatement measures if emissions are priced at about USD 20/tonne CO2\u2011equivalent. Tapping into this potential will require new regulatory frameworks, financing mechanisms and improved emissions tracking.\nDelivering the 75% cut in methane emissions requires USD 170 billion in spending to 2030\nMethane abatement in the fossil fuel industry is one of the most pragmatic and lowest cost options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technologies and measures to prevent emissions are well known and have already been deployed successfully around the world. Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and sold or used. The share is higher for oil and natural gas (50%) than for coal (15%).\n[2]\nThe good news is that acting on methane comes with tremendous benefits, helping to limit near-term temperature rise and improve air quality, leading to better public health outcomes and improved food security. These actions can often be implemented at zero or low cost, providing significant economic benefits for governments and companies. In fact, in several cases, the actions reap cost savings after the initial investments are paid off.

In areas where emission reductions are more difficult to achieve, like enteric fermentation, groups such as the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate and the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases are helping spur greater innovation and technology deployment.\nReducing food loss and waste is another important area. Roughly one third of all food produced is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain, with agricultural production responsible for the greatest amount, exacerbating food insecurity in vulnerable nations. These losses are due to many factors, including spillage or degradation during production.\nThe waste sector accounts for around 20% of global human-caused methane emissions. Luckily, cost-effective mitigation solutions do exist, with the greatest potential related to separating organics and recycling which can also create new jobs. Upstream avoidance of food loss and waste is also key.\nAdditionally, capturing landfill gas and generating energy will reduce methane emissions, displace other forms of fuels and create new streams of revenue. The EPA projects that landfill gas utilization will remain the cheapest solution to mitigate emissions in the waste sector, often implemented at zero net cost. However, projects require high upfront capital costs which can sometimes be a deterrent in poorer jurisdictions.\nWhich Countries are Already Committed to Reduce Methane?\n[3]\nThe five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management. In each of these industries, there is a solid economic case to take abatement action. In this article, we look at methane\u2019s impact on the climate, potential ways to reduce emissions, and steps that companies can take to begin managing methane effectively.\nReducing methane emissions is essential to stopping climate change\u2014but some barriers stand in the way\n[4]\nVoluntary initiatives must work in tandem with policies and regulations to ensure a definitive decline in methane emissions. When conducted in parallel with government action, industry initiatives play an important role in driving rapid cuts and leading abatement efforts. Multiple international oil and gas companies have set targets to restrict emissions or the emissions intensity of production, and many voluntary, industry-led efforts are attempting to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations and sharing best practices on methane management. Yet many companies have not committed to act on methane, and several of the existing voluntary initiatives lack accountability mechanisms.\n[5]\nIncreased public investment in agriculture extension and technology transfer, programs that provide new technologies and innovations to farmers and food producers throughout the supply chain, is also critical to the overall goal. Total investment in this critical category needs to increase by an additional $51 billion in 2025 to $224 billion by 2035 to unlock benefits of the food system innovation measures.\nInnovations drive methane emissions reductions\nThe global food and agriculture sector is diverse and accounts for a small share of global economy but plays a critical role in the lives of billions.

Generating the new technologies and techniques needed to slash methane emissions in the food and agriculture sector requires a level of spending in proportion to the importance of this goal.\n[6]\nEnergy emissions have increased by 61.9% since 1990. However, energy emissions growth has slowed down since 2013, only increasing by 4% over the last five years. Land-use change and forestry is the only sector that has decreased its emissions since 1990 (14% decrease, fourth largest sector), although their values reached its lowest point in 2013 and have been steadily increasing since. All the other sectors continued to increase their emissions since 1990, including agriculture (16% increase, second largest sector), industrial emissions (203% increase, third largest sector), and waste (19.5% increase, fifth largest sector).\nAvoiding the worst climate impacts will require reversing the upwards trend in all sectors and rapidly decreasing emissions to net zero by 2050.\n3) Many Top Emitters Are Reducing their Emissions Per Capita\n[7]\nThe good news is that reducing methane emissions is a low-hanging fruit with zero net cost; that is 40 percent of emissions can typically be eliminated with readily available technology whose cost would be balanced by the gains in gas production. And this fruit is even bigger in Iraq\u2019s case as it can eliminate up to 64 percent of emissions at zero-cost according to IEA analysis.\nIn addition to the climate and economic benefits, reducing methane emissions would also help alleviate Iraq\u2019s chronic air pollution.

This is particularly evident in countries such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, where methane emissions are disproportionately high relative to their gas production. Effective methane management practices can yield substantial economic and environmental benefits, thereby contributing significantly to climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n## Economic Benefits of Methane Management\n\nOne of the primary economic advantages of reducing methane emissions is the potential for cost savings. Captured methane can be utilized as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. For instance, it is estimated that 40% of global methane emissions from fossil fuels can be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured gas outweighs the costs of abatement measures [1]. This zero-cost potential is even more pronounced in Iraq, where up to 64% of emissions could be eliminated at no additional cost [7].\n\nThe fossil fuel industry, which generated substantial income in 2023, is well-positioned to finance these abatement measures. The required spending represents less than 5% of the industry's income for that year, making it a feasible investment [1]. However, financial support from external sources is also crucial, especially for low- and middle-income countries where financing mechanisms may be limited. \n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nBeyond the economic advantages, there is an ethical imperative to address methane emissions. Reducing these emissions contributes to limiting near-term temperature rise and improving air quality, which leads to better public health outcomes and food security [2]. This ethical dimension resonates with broader goals of sustainable development and corporate responsibility. \n\n## Policy and Regulatory Frameworks\n\nImplementing effective methane abatement measures requires robust regulatory frameworks and policy incentives. International support can play a significant role in helping countries overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to reducing emissions. For example, voluntary initiatives and coalitions, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, are working towards lowering methane emissions by sharing best practices and setting emission targets [4]. However, these efforts need to be complemented by stringent government policies to ensure accountability and drive rapid reductions.\n\n## Human Impact\n\nThe human angle is equally compelling. Improved air quality from reduced methane emissions can enhance the quality of life for local communities. In Iraq, for example, reducing methane emissions could alleviate chronic air pollution, leading to significant health benefits for the population [7]. This underscores the importance of integrating environmental responsibility into economic models to achieve both ecological and societal well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, balancing oil gains with environmental responsibility is not only economically viable but also ethically imperative. By leveraging both internal industry resources and external financial support, and by adopting robust policy frameworks, countries can significantly reduce methane emissions. This integrated approach ensures sustainable economic growth while addressing the urgent need for climate change mitigation and public health improvement.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565528, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_a5d11b2ef2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 584, "prompt_tokens": 2290, "total_tokens": 2874, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

The United States is the largest emitter of methane from oil and gas operations, closely followed by the Russian Federation (hereafter \u201cRussia\u201d). The People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter \u201cChina\u201d) is by far the highest emitter in the coal sector. The amount of methane lost in fossil fuel operations globally in 2023 was 170 billion cubic metres, more than Qatar\u2019s natural gas production.\nMethane abatement in the fossil fuel industry is one of the most pragmatic and lowest cost options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technologies and measures to prevent emissions are well known and have already been deployed successfully around the world. Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and sold or used. The share is higher for oil and natural gas (50%) than for coal (15%).\nAnalysis of this data reveals both signs of progress and some worrying trends. On one hand, more governments and fossil fuel companies have committed to take action on methane. Global efforts to report emissions estimates consistently and transparently are strengthening, and studies suggest emissions are falling in some regions. However, overall emissions remain far too high to meet the world\u2019s climate goals. Large methane emissions events detected by satellites also rose by more than 50% in 2023 compared with 2022, with more than 5 Mt of methane emissions detected from major fossil fuel leaks around the world \u2013 including a major well blowout in Kazakhstan that went on for more than 200 days.\nMethane emissions from energy, 2000-2023\nOpenClose to 70% of methane emissions from fossil fuels come from the top 10 emitting countries\n[2]\nThe International Energy Agency estimates around 75% of total oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided using currently available technologies, with more than half of these reductions at zero net cost. But despite the clear economic case for sealing leaks, utilities often recoup the costs of leaked gas by passing them on to consumers. Voluntary coalitions are, however, coming together to work toward lowering methane emissions in the sector, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.\nFood Systems\nAgriculture is the largest contributor to global methane emissions, producing about 40% of these emissions, primarily from enteric fermentation (cow burps), rice cultivation and manure management.\nTwelve countries are responsible for around two-thirds of global methane emissions: China, Russia, India, the United States, Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Mexico, Australia and Nigeria.\nMost human-caused methane emissions stem from three sectors \u2014 energy (35%), agriculture (40%) and waste (20%) \u2014 so a focus on action in these sectors can help to stave off immediate warming impacts.\nEnergy\nThe energy sector is responsible for more than a third of global methane emissions, with oil and gas contributing the lion\u2019s share (around 14%). Methane emissions occur along the entire oil and gas supply chain, but especially from fugitive emissions from leaking equipment, system upsets, and deliberate flaring and venting.\nExisting cost-effective solutions can help reduce emissions, including initiating leak detection and repair programs, implementing better technologies and operating practices, and capturing and utilizing methane that would otherwise be wasted.\n[3]\nBroadening the coalition of countries committed to ambitious methane reductions is essential. The world\u2019s five largest methane emitters (from all sources) are China, India, the United States, Russia and Brazil. Together, they are responsible for close to half of all methane emissions globally. Of these, only the United States and Brazil are part of the Global Methane Pledge. Looking only at energy-related emissions, the five largest emitting countries are China, Russia, the United States, Iran and India. Of these, only the United States is part of the Pledge.\nTop ten emitters of methane, 2021\nOpenIf all countries adopted tried and tested abatement policies, this would cut oil and gas methane leaks by half\nOur broad reviews of policies and regulations reveal some success stories that other countries can look to for inspiration. The United States and Canada have both implemented key tried and tested approaches, although there is still room to strengthen their requirements and expand coverage further. Norway and the Netherlands have gone the furthest towards adopting a comprehensive regime, as they have robust measurement and reporting requirements, ensure best industry practice, and economic incentives that encourage abatement action. Actions under the EU Methane Strategy will broaden these efforts across Europe.\n[4]\n3.1 Evaluation of posterior emission estimates\nFigure 2 shows the posterior emissions, and Fig. 5 shows the posterior\u2013prior emission ratios on the 0.25\u2218 \u00d7 0.3125\u2218 grid. Also shown are the averaging kernel sensitivities (diagonal elements of the averaging kernel matrix A) that identify where the TROPOMI observations are most effective at quantifying emissions. We achieve 123 independent pieces of information (DOFS) to quantify emissions over the inversion domain. The GMM aggregates weak prior emissions mainly following spatial proximity (dictated by the similarity factors longitude and latitude). The rectilinear latitude\u2013longitude patterns in low-emitting regions reflect this aggregation. Thin lines between some of the rectilinear patterns reflect the superimposition of corrections from individual Gaussians onto the 0.25\u2218 \u00d7 0.3125\u2218 grid.\nWe use 2019 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane in an analytical inversion to quantify methane emissions from the Middle East and North Africa at up to \u223c25 km \u00d7 25 km resolution, using spatially allocated national United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reports as prior estimates for the fuel sector. Our resulting best estimate of anthropogenic emissions for the region is 35 % higher than the prior bottom-up inventories (+103 % for gas, +53 % for waste, +49 % for livestock, \u221214 % for oil) with large variability across countries. Oil and gas account for 38 % of total anthropogenic emissions in the region. TROPOMI observations can effectively optimize and separate national emissions by sector for most of the 23 countries in the region, with 6 countries accounting for most of total anthropogenic emissions including Iran (5.3 (5.0\u20135.5) Tg a\u22121; best estimate and uncertainty range), Turkmenistan (4.4 (2.8\u20135.1) Tg a\u22121), Saudi Arabia (4.3 (2.4\u20136\n3.3 Major emitting countries and comparison to previous studies\nThe IPCC (2006) recommends the use of emission factors per unit oil or gas produced in the construction of bottom-up emission inventories, but these emission factors vary by orders of magnitude between countries, and we find that there is in fact no significant relationship between emissions and production rates at the country level. Well counts are a better activity metric to predict emissions, but national-scale correlations to emissions are still weak (r=0.19\u201325), even in combination with production rates (r=0.26\u20130.28). The importance and stochastic nature of local operating conditions and management practices in determining oil\u2013gas emissions may stifle attempts to relate these emissions to simple activity metrics. This implies that top-down emission estimates from atmospheric observations are essential for the oil\u2013gas sector and need to be considered part of the global stocktake and UNFCCC reporting.\n2.2 Prior emissions\nFigure 9 compares our posterior emissions from the top six emitting countries in the Middle East and North Africa (Iran, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Egypt, and Turkey, accounting for 62 % of region-wide anthropogenic emissions) to the prior emission estimate and to previous inversion results from Worden et al. (2022), Deng et al. (2022), and Western et al. (2021) that all used the much sparser GOSAT data. Worden et al. (2022) presented national results by mapping the global 2019 inversion results of Qu et al. (2021) at resolution, with a prior estimate of fuel emissions from GFEIv1 (Scarpelli et al., 2020) and other sectors from EDGARv6. Deng et al. (2022) compiled results of 11 independent inversions from different groups contributing to the Global Methane Budget initiative (Saunois et al., 2020) for 2010\u20132017. Western et al\nWe report optimized sector-resolved emissions for the 23 individual countries in the region. We find that TROPOMI observations can effectively constrain and individually separate emissions for most of the countries (19 out of 23). The others have small emissions. Total anthropogenic emissions in the region are 35 % higher than in the prior estimate, reflecting increases in emissions from gas (+103 %), waste (+53 %), and livestock (+49 %) but a decrease in oil (\u221214 %).\n[5]\nDeforestation is Venezuela\u2019s second-largest source of emissions after the energy sector. The alarming pace of destruction in the country\u2019s Amazon forest, one of the world\u2019s critical carbon sinks, is also a source of international concern, particularly since Venezuela has refused to join Brazil\u2019s and Colombia\u2019s efforts to halt its deforestation. Venezuela is one of the few countries that did not sign the COP 26 declaration on forests and land use.\nSuch destruction\n\nThe topic of the page:\n**Balancing Oil Gains with Environmental Responsibility: A New Economic Model for Methane Emissions**\n\nThe document highlights eight countries, including Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, which have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production.

The country\u2019s second-largest source of emissions, after the energy sector, is deforestation, primarily in the Amazon forest, one of the world\u2019s critical carbon sinks[5]. Despite international concerns, Venezuela has not joined regional efforts led by Brazil and Colombia to curb deforestation and was notably absent from the COP 26 declaration on forests and land use[5]. Addressing these issues could yield significant reductions in methane emissions and provide economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or lower domestic energy costs.\n\n## Turkmenistan\n\nTurkmenistan is another country with disproportionately high methane emissions compared to its gas production. Analysis of TROPOMI satellite data reveals that oil and gas operations are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, highlighting the need for improved methane management practices[4]. Despite available cost-effective technologies that can substantially reduce these emissions, current infrastructural and technological barriers hinder progress[2]. International support in the form of technology transfer and financial incentives could play a crucial role in mitigating these emissions and aligning Turkmenistan\u2019s economic strategies with global climate goals.\n\n## Iraq\n\nIraq faces similar challenges, with high methane emissions relative to its gas production. Existing infrastructure and operational practices often result in substantial fugitive emissions from leaking equipment and deliberate flaring and venting[2]. Initiating comprehensive leak detection and repair programs, along with the adoption of better technologies, could significantly reduce these emissions. Moreover, policy incentives or penalties might alter Iraq's economic strategies, compelling it to adopt more sustainable practices[2]. International cooperation and funding could support these initiatives, potentially leading to substantial environmental and economic benefits.\n\n## China\n\nChina is the highest emitter of methane in the coal sector and is also among the top five global emitters of methane from all sources[1][3]. Despite the high emissions, China has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, which further complicates global efforts to reduce methane levels[3]. Adopting tried and tested abatement policies could cut emissions significantly, presenting an opportunity for China to balance its economic growth with environmental responsibility[3]. Improved methane management could also lead to better air quality and enhanced public health, adding a compelling human dimension to the narrative.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia follows closely behind the United States as the second-largest emitter of methane from oil and gas operations[1]. The country faces significant methane emissions from its extensive oil and gas infrastructure, which includes a vast network of aging pipelines and equipment prone to leaks[2]. Adopting comprehensive measurement and reporting requirements, similar to those implemented in Norway and the Netherlands, could help Russia reduce its methane emissions[3]. International support in the form of technology and expertise sharing could facilitate these efforts, potentially leading to significant environmental and economic gains.\n\n## India\n\nIndia is one of the top five global methane emitters, with significant contributions from both agriculture and energy sectors[3]. Despite the high emissions, India has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, highlighting a gap in global climate efforts[3]. Implementing abatement technologies and improving methane management practices could help India reduce its emissions, providing economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source[2]. Enhanced air quality from reduced emissions would also benefit local communities, improving public health and quality of life.\n\n## Brazil", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565529, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_a5d11b2ef2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 700, "prompt_tokens": 2477, "total_tokens": 3177, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Cutting methane emissions is low-hanging fruit in tackling climate change. It is vital to aligning the global energy sector with a global 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory.\nTackling fugitive methane emissions and unlit flares (venting) requires the development of new technologies capable of not only detecting methane but of accurately measuring these emissions. The accuracy of detection and measurement technologies has increased dramatically over the last few years. Still, effective leak detection and repair (LDAR) often requires using several complementary approaches, from satellites and aerial surveillance down to on-the-ground teams operating handheld devices.\n[2]\nDuring the meeting, Olga Gasan-zade, Senior Advisor of Carbon Limits company and Expert with a focus on climate change mitigation, presented the best practices and experiences in reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, as well as methods of methane emissions detection, measurement techniques and quantification. The expert mentioned that methane\u2019s warming potential is more than 80 times higher than of carbon dioxide for the 20-year period. At the same time investments to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas are much lower than in agriculture.\n[3]\n. Image Image Reducing methane emissions by 45% by 2030 would offer immediate and long-lasting multiple benefits not only for the climate, but also agriculture, human and ecosystem health. Every year, these benefits would be equal to a global saving of approximately US$470 billion. SOLUTIONS Trends in methane emissions need to be reversed now to achieve a multitude of benefits by 2030. Targeted measures can be rapidly deployed to reduce methane emissions from the fossil fuel and waste sectors, with a majority at negative or low cost. To achieve targets consistent with keeping warming to 1.5\u00b0C, a combination of targeted measures and additional measures which reduce methane but do not primarily target it, are needed for all sectors\n[4]\nMethane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is more potent than carbon dioxide and responsible for approximately one third of the warming from greenhouse gases occurring today. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States. Quick reduction of these methane emissions is one of the most important and cost-effective actions the United States can take in the short term to slow the rate of rapidly rising global temperatures.\nEPA issued a final rule in December 2023 to sharply reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollution from new and existing oil and gas operations. In addition, EPA is working to implement the three-part framework of the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\nAdvanced measurement technologies, and their use for annual quantification of emissions, are evolving rapidly. EPA is committed to transparent and continual improvements to its programs to account for these advancements while ensuring reporting is accurate and complete. The agency intends to take the following steps to gather further information about advanced measurement technologies and to inform potential regulatory changes or other standard setting programs that encourage the use of more accurate and comprehensive measurement strategies:\n[5]\nMethane abatement in the fossil fuel industry is one of the most pragmatic and lowest cost options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technologies and measures to prevent emissions are well known and have already been deployed successfully around the world. Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and sold or used. The share is higher for oil and natural gas (50%) than for coal (15%).\n[6]\nDuring the decision-making process, it is important to calculate the pros and cons of each solution properly. But what to do if we want to invest in new technology but the costs are too high? Luckily, there are some solutions! For example, it is possible to establish a partnership with high technology companies and receive f.ex. machines, instead of buying them. Also, the government plays a significant role in digitalizing the construction industry by adjusting the law or supporting companies with benefit programs. When it comes to construction management software, many companies offer free trials or demos that show all the possible solutions. Plus, in some cases, you can count on support in software implementation that will help you avoid the cost of losing time and the team\u2019s productivity.\nNot every expense is a cost. You need to think long-term. To gain something, you always have to invest first. Same goes for modern construction management solutions. However, in the future, you may find out that the benefits exceed the costs multiple times! But to see it we have to stop thinking about innovations as another cost for our company. It is the investment that will give you more control and more time.

Innovations like drones or robotic swarms are more and more common, but they still remain a quite big expense for companies. It\u2019s similar with software solutions: the rising popularity of construction management solutions (state of the art systems, BIM, AI models) is understandable but they are all more expensive compared to traditional methods. And many times this is seen as a problem (and a deal-breaker).\nTime\nThe time is also a cost, especially in the construction industry, where strict deadlines and financial penalties for delays exist in every project.

Especially now, during coronavirus pandemic, fast adaptation can be even more crucial than before. However, the case of new technology and its implementation would not be complete if we did not mention the most significant aspect of every investment - the cost.\nWhen it comes to the cost, we should highlight three main categories.\nMoney\nThis category is about the physical cost for the company like problems with team management, security or workflow. For example, investing in drones can be connected with the reduction of employment, which can easily demotivate the rest of the staff.\nAlso, introducing new technology to employees, especially older ones, might be another challenge. Often construction management solutions seem at first as too complex, which can discourage the team and bring problems with the overall workflow.\nSo, with all those costs and risks mentioned above, why would you still decide to use innovative solutions in your company?\nOftentimes, when companies consider investing in new technologies, they usually focus too much on costs and underestimate the benefits of the solutions. As we mentioned at the beginning of the article, we need innovations to better respond to customer needs and not to be left behind our competitors in this constantly changing market.\n[7]\nWhat does an integrated digital system do? It helps businesses to bring together various processes and data points into one unified structure. This centralization cuts down on the need for multiple software solutions. It reduces reliance on different service providers, and streamlines training needs.\nFor instance, a centralized Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system offers detailed insights into customer interactions. You don\u2019t ever need separate tools for marketing, sales, and customer support.\nReducing Downtime\nAnother area where digital transformation can save costs is by reducing downtime. Advanced digital solutions include predictive maintenance and the Internet of Things (IoT). They can foresee equipment failures before they happen, enabling proactive upkeep.\nThis predictive method prolongs the lifespan of equipment.

Despite these advancements, the deployment of such technologies often requires substantial initial investments and continuous updates to stay effective [4].\n\n## Economic Considerations\n\nOne of the most pragmatic and cost-effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is methane abatement in the fossil fuel industry. Approximately 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured methane gas often exceeds the required outlays for abatement measures [5]. For instance, investing in technologies to capture methane can lead to additional revenues from the sale of the captured gas. This economic benefit is more pronounced in the oil and natural gas sectors, where up to 50% of methane emissions can be reduced at no net cost [5].\n\nMoreover, integrating advanced digital systems can streamline operations and reduce costs in the long run. Centralized systems, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms, reduce reliance on multiple software solutions and service providers, while predictive maintenance technologies can minimize expensive downtimes associated with equipment failures [7].\n\n## Policy and Regulatory Support\n\nRegulatory frameworks play a critical role in driving methane emission reductions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule in December 2023 to significantly reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations. This rule is part of a broader effort under the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which includes measures to promote the adoption of advanced measurement technologies [4]. International support and policy incentives are essential for countries with high methane emissions, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, to overcome infrastructural and technological barriers [7].\n\n## Balancing Costs and Benefits\n\nImplementing new technologies and innovations often comes with high initial costs, including investments in hardware, software, and employee training. However, these costs should be viewed as long-term investments rather than immediate expenses. Over time, the benefits of improved methane management\u2014such as reduced emissions, better air quality, and potential economic gains from captured methane\u2014can far outweigh the initial outlays [6]. Additionally, partnerships with technology companies and government support through benefit programs can help mitigate these costs and facilitate the adoption of innovative solutions [6].\n\nIn conclusion, overcoming the challenges of methane emission reduction requires a multifaceted approach that leverages technological advancements, economic incentives, and robust policy frameworks. By addressing these barriers, countries can achieve significant climate benefits while also gaining economically from improved methane management practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1726565529, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_a5d11b2ef2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 643, "prompt_tokens": 2271, "total_tokens": 2914, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

It also results from agriculture and livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills. In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States, a notable concern given that methane is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) [1]. Methane's high global-warming potential\u201484 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period\u2014makes it a critical target for climate change mitigation efforts [2].\nGlobally, methane emissions have surged in the past 15 years, with human activities playing a significant role. Approximately two-thirds of global methane emissions originate from human activities, including oil and gas operations, coal mining, landfills, livestock, and rice paddies [3]. This dramatic increase has led the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to officially list methane as a climate change priority to address this decade [1]. Notably, methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution [4].\nMethane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 10-20 years, compared to centuries for CO2, but it absorbs much more energy while it is in the atmosphere [5]. This short-lived climate pollutant can lead to ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant, and pose explosion hazards due to leaks [4]. Moreover, atmospheric concentrations of methane have more than doubled since pre-industrial times, making it second only to CO2 in driving climate change [6].\nThe oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and quick reduction of these emissions is one of the most cost-effective actions the country can take to slow the rate of rising global temperatures [7]. Technologies to limit methane emissions are already available and have been successfully deployed in various parts of the world. Approximately 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023 [8].\nReducing methane emissions not only helps mitigate climate change but also offers significant economic benefits. Captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. International cooperation and support could further enhance these efforts by addressing infrastructural and technological barriers in countries with high methane emissions, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq [1][2].\n\n# Economic Models for Environmental Responsibility\n\nBalancing economic growth with environmental stewardship is a complex but essential challenge for nations with high methane emissions. This is particularly evident in countries such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, where methane emissions are disproportionately high relative to their gas production. Effective methane management practices can yield substantial economic and environmental benefits, thereby contributing significantly to climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n## Economic Benefits of Methane Management\n\nOne of the primary economic advantages of reducing methane emissions is the potential for cost savings. Captured methane can be utilized as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. For instance, it is estimated that 40% of global methane emissions from fossil fuels can be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured gas outweighs the costs of abatement measures [8]. This zero-cost potential is even more pronounced in Iraq, where up to 64% of emissions could be eliminated at no additional cost [9].\nThe fossil fuel industry, which generated substantial income in 2023, is well-positioned to finance these abatement measures. The required spending represents less than 5% of the industry's income for that year, making it a feasible investment [8]. However, financial support from external sources is also crucial, especially for low- and middle-income countries where financing mechanisms may be limited.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nBeyond the economic advantages, there is an ethical imperative to address methane emissions. Reducing these emissions contributes to limiting near-term temperature rise and improving air quality, which leads to better public health outcomes and food security [10]. This ethical dimension resonates with broader goals of sustainable development and corporate responsibility.\n\n## Policy and Regulatory Frameworks\n\nImplementing effective methane abatement measures requires robust regulatory frameworks and policy incentives. International support can play a significant role in helping countries overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to reducing emissions. For example, voluntary initiatives and coalitions, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, are working towards lowering methane emissions by sharing best practices and setting emission targets [11]. However, these efforts need to be complemented by stringent government policies to ensure accountability and drive rapid reductions.\n\n## Human Impact\n\nThe human angle is equally compelling. Improved air quality from reduced methane emissions can enhance the quality of life for local communities. In Iraq, for example, reducing methane emissions could alleviate chronic air pollution, leading to significant health benefits for the population [9]. This underscores the importance of integrating environmental responsibility into economic models to achieve both ecological and societal well-being.\n\n# Global Methane Emissions Landscape\n\nMethane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas emitted during the production and transport of oil, natural gas, and coal, as well as from agriculture, livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills[1]. In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the US, which is particularly alarming given its potency; methane is 25 percent more effective at trapping heat than CO2[1]. Moreover, methane is responsible for approximately 30 percent of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution[12].\n\n## Recent Trends and Developments\n\nIn recent years, the understanding of methane emissions has grown significantly due to advances in monitoring technologies, notably from satellites[4]. Satellites can now detect and quantify methane emissions from major leaks over large areas down to smaller leaks at the facility level[4]. New satellite technologies like GHGSat, EnMAP, Carbon Mapper, and MethaneSAT promise to deliver higher-resolution images and more sensitive detection thresholds, improving methane quantification capabilities and supporting regulatory oversight[4]. For example, emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were among the first offshore leaks quantified using satellite data, with estimates ranging between 75,000 and 230,000 tonnes of methane[4].\n\n## Economic and Environmental Implications\n\nAddressing methane emissions is not only crucial for climate change mitigation but also has significant economic implications. Countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production, and managing these emissions could yield substantial reductions in global methane levels[13]. Improved methane management practices could result in economic savings from captured methane being used as a clean energy source, potentially boosting exports or reducing domestic energy costs[13].\nFour of the ten largest oil and gas methane emitters, including the US, Canada, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia, have signed the Global Methane Pledge, targeting a 30 percent reduction in global emissions by the end of this decade from 2020 levels[13]. If methane generated from human activity is responsible for a larger share of the world's total emissions, including natural sources, achieving this target could have profound effects on mitigating climate change.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nDespite the potential benefits, significant challenges remain. Incomplete information about actual emissions levels and a lack of awareness of the cost-effectiveness of abatement are key barriers[4]. Moreover, infrastructural and technological barriers hinder many countries from effectively reducing methane emissions. International support, policy incentives, and technological advancements are essential to overcoming these barriers[4].\n\n## Human and Ethical Considerations\n\nBeyond economics, there is the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. Local communities affected by methane emissions often face health risks and reduced quality of life. Improved air quality resulting from better methane management could enhance their quality of life, providing an emotionally compelling narrative for sustainable development and corporate responsibility[4].\n\n# Detailed Case Studies: Countries with High Methane Emissions\n\n## Venezuela\n\nVenezuela's methane emissions are alarmingly high, particularly in relation to its gas production. The country\u2019s second-largest source of emissions, after the energy sector, is deforestation, primarily in the Amazon forest, one of the world\u2019s critical carbon sinks[14]. Despite international concerns, Venezuela has not joined regional efforts led by Brazil and Colombia to curb deforestation and was notably absent from the COP 26 declaration on forests and land use[14]. Addressing these issues could yield significant reductions in methane emissions and provide economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or lower domestic energy costs.\n\n## Turkmenistan\n\nTurkmenistan is another country with disproportionately high methane emissions compared to its gas production. Analysis of TROPOMI satellite data reveals that oil and gas operations are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, highlighting the need for improved methane management practices[15]. Despite available cost-effective technologies that can substantially reduce these emissions, current infrastructural and technological barriers hinder progress[10]. International support in the form of technology transfer and financial incentives could play a crucial role in mitigating these emissions and aligning Turkmenistan\u2019s economic strategies with global climate goals.\n\n## Iraq\n\nIraq faces similar challenges, with high methane emissions relative to its gas production. Existing infrastructure and operational practices often result in substantial fugitive emissions from leaking equipment and deliberate flaring and venting[10]. Initiating comprehensive leak detection and repair programs, along with the adoption of better technologies, could significantly reduce these emissions. Moreover, policy incentives or penalties might alter Iraq's economic strategies, compelling it to adopt more sustainable practices[10]. International cooperation and funding could support these initiatives, potentially leading to substantial environmental and economic benefits.\n\n## China\n\nChina is the highest emitter of methane in the coal sector and is also among the top five global emitters of methane from all sources[8][16]. Despite the high emissions, China has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, which further complicates global efforts to reduce methane levels[16]. Adopting tried and tested abatement policies could cut emissions significantly, presenting an opportunity for China to balance its economic growth with environmental responsibility[16]. Improved methane management could also lead to better air quality and enhanced public health, adding a compelling human dimension to the narrative.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia follows closely behind the United States as the second-largest emitter of methane from oil and gas operations[8]. The country faces significant methane emissions from its extensive oil and gas infrastructure, which includes a vast network of aging pipelines and equipment prone to leaks[10]. Adopting comprehensive measurement and reporting requirements, similar to those implemented in Norway and the Netherlands, could help Russia reduce its methane emissions[16]. International support in the form of technology and expertise sharing could facilitate these efforts, potentially leading to significant environmental and economic gains.\n\n## India\n\nIndia is one of the top five global methane emitters, with significant contributions from both agriculture and energy sectors[16]. Despite the high emissions, India has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, highlighting a gap in global climate efforts[16]. Implementing abatement technologies and improving methane management practices could help India reduce its emissions, providing economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source[10]. Enhanced air quality from reduced emissions would also benefit local communities, improving public health and quality of life.\n\n# Overcoming Challenges in Methane Emission Reduction\n\nReducing methane emissions, particularly in the oil and gas sector, presents several challenges that need to be addressed through technological, economic, and policy measures. Tackling these challenges is crucial for achieving substantial climate benefits and aligning global energy practices with a 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory.\n\n## Technological Barriers and Solutions\n\nThe detection and accurate measurement of methane emissions have historically been major obstacles in effective methane management. However, recent advancements in technology have significantly improved the accuracy of leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs. Modern approaches now incorporate a combination of satellites, aerial surveillance, and ground-based teams equipped with handheld devices, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for identifying and quantifying emissions [17]. Despite these advancements, the deployment of such technologies often requires substantial initial investments and continuous updates to stay effective [7].\n\n## Economic Considerations\n\nOne of the most pragmatic and cost-effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is methane abatement in the fossil fuel industry. Approximately 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured methane gas often exceeds the required outlays for abatement measures [8]. For instance, investing in technologies to capture methane can lead to additional revenues from the sale of the captured gas. This economic benefit is more pronounced in the oil and natural gas sectors, where up to 50% of methane emissions can be reduced at no net cost [8].\nMoreover, integrating advanced digital systems can streamline operations and reduce costs in the long run. Centralized systems, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms, reduce reliance on multiple software solutions and service providers, while predictive maintenance technologies can minimize expensive downtimes associated with equipment failures [18].\n\n## Policy and Regulatory Support\n\nRegulatory frameworks play a critical role in driving methane emission reductions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule in December 2023 to significantly reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations. This rule is part of a broader effort under the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which includes measures to promote the adoption of advanced measurement technologies [7]. International support and policy incentives are essential for countries with high methane emissions, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, to overcome infrastructural and technological barriers [18].\n\n## Balancing Costs and Benefits\n\nImplementing new technologies and innovations often comes with high initial costs, including investments in hardware, software, and employee training. However, these costs should be viewed as long-term investments rather than immediate expenses. Over time, the benefits of improved methane management\u2014such as reduced emissions, better air quality, and potential economic gains from captured methane\u2014can far outweigh the initial outlays [19]. Additionally, partnerships with technology companies and government support through benefit programs can help mitigate these costs and facilitate the adoption of innovative solutions [19].\n\n# Advantages of Effective Methane Management\n\nEffective management of methane emissions offers numerous advantages, spanning environmental, economic, and public health benefits.\n\n## Economic Benefits\n\nAddressing methane emissions can also result in considerable economic advantages. For instance, many mitigation measures are low-cost and provide significant economic benefits once initial investments are paid off[10]. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 75% of oil and gas methane emissions could be mitigated using existing technologies, with over half of these reductions achievable at zero net cost[10]. Additionally, deploying innovations to reduce methane emissions in agriculture and food systems could potentially reduce the cost of achieving climate targets by up to US$1 trillion by 2050[20].\nMoreover, captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, enhancing energy security and potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs for countries[10]. This economic benefit aligns with the broader goal of transitioning to more sustainable and resilient energy systems.\n\n## Environmental Benefits\n\nMethane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential more than 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period[10][13]. Reducing methane emissions can, therefore, have a profound impact on slowing climate change. For example, the Global Methane Pledge aims for a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030, which could significantly mitigate climate change impacts[13].\n\n## Public Health Benefits\n\nReducing methane emissions also brings substantial public health benefits. Methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is linked to severe health issues such as respiratory and cardiac illnesses[20]. It is estimated that ozone exposure results in approximately one million premature deaths annually[20]. A recent study found that for every megaton of methane emissions reduced, about 1,430 premature deaths are avoided each year, alongside numerous hospitalizations and emergency department visits[20]. Improved air quality from lower methane emissions can thus significantly enhance public health and quality of life.\n\n## Broader System Benefits\n\nInvesting in methane reduction measures across sectors, including agriculture, energy, and waste, can provide extensive system-wide benefits. Innovations in methane management not only reduce emissions but also contribute to better land conservation, water preservation, and improved agricultural productivity[20]. These comprehensive benefits underscore the importance of integrating methane management into broader environmental and economic policies.\n\n# Policy and International Initiatives\n\nPolicy and regulatory action to curb methane emissions remains uneven globally, although there has been notable progress in 2023. Several countries and regions have either adopted or proposed new regulations aimed at reducing methane emissions, aligning broadly with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario).\nIn December 2023, the United States finalized new regulations that impose stricter requirements on new and modified oil and gas facilities. These regulations also provide guidelines for states to regulate existing sources. A significant feature of the new rule is the establishment of the Super Emitter Program, which allows the government to act on emissions events detected remotely by qualified third parties, such as the International Methane Emissions Observatory\u2019s Methane Alert and Response System. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this rule will cut emissions by nearly 80% from 2024 to 2038[11].\nThe European Union's external energy engagement strategy aims to provide technical assistance to partner countries for deploying methane abatement technologies. This strategy includes a \"You Collect, We Buy\" scheme, which the EU announced it would pilot with Algeria. Additionally, Japan and South Korea introduced the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement toward Net-zero (CLEAN) project. Under this initiative, large LNG purchasers will gather information from suppliers regarding methane reduction efforts to increase transparency about LNG-related emissions[11].\nHowever, turning these ambitions into action will require active coordination and cooperation. There are numerous international methane initiatives designed to support increased action, with more emerging annually. The IEA is involved in many of these efforts, which serve as platforms for collaboration and knowledge sharing[16].\nThe United States and Canada have implemented effective approaches, although there remains room for improvement. Norway and the Netherlands are leading by example with comprehensive regimes that include robust measurement and reporting requirements, best industry practices, and economic incentives for methane abatement. Actions under the EU Methane Strategy are expected to extend these efforts across Europe[16].\nDespite these advancements, some significant players like China, India, and the Russian Federation have not yet joined these global initiatives. Engaging with these countries is critical to achieving the overall target of reducing global methane emissions. For instance, in the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration, China committed to developing a comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane to achieve substantial emission reductions in the 2020s[21].\nThe priority is to implement practical solutions that can be executed at relatively low or net-negative costs. Where costs are prohibitive, coordinated action is necessary to create the infrastructure and fiscal conditions to support further initiatives. Enhanced monitoring, reporting, and verification, along with greater consumer choice and funding for technical solutions, are essential. Without these efforts, current initiatives may fail, jeopardizing global climate goals and leading to a precarious future[5].\n\nWrite the lead section:", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A8OrIeOb68khj2v2xCfT6UGcAHLSm", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "**Balancing Oil Gains with Environmental Responsibility: A New Economic Model for Methane Emissions**\n\nMethane, a potent greenhouse gas, is significantly more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, making its management crucial for climate change mitigation.
