In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, Iraq alone is responsible for around eight percent of global methane emissions, despite only accounting for three percent of global oil and gas production [1]. This wasted gas is estimated to be worth USD 1.5 billion, highlighting the economic impact of uncontrolled methane emissions.\n\nHowever, countries like Iraq are now taking steps to address this issue. In 2020, the Iraq Ministry of Health and Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme co-hosted a virtual seminar where they announced the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to better understand and mitigate methane emissions from the country's oil and gas sector [1]. This not only shows a commitment to reducing emissions, but also highlights the potential economic benefits that can be gained from addressing this issue.\n\nSimilarly, Turkmenistan has also taken steps towards harnessing the power of methane emissions reduction. In collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme, UN Turkmenistan organized a training for Turkmen officials on strategic actions in methane management and ways to mitigate emissions [3]. As a country with significant potential for low-cost methane reduction, Turkmenistan has a pivotal role to play in addressing climate change.\n\nOn a global scale, the World Bank has estimated that methane emissions contribute to over a quarter of the current global warming trend [5]. This highlights the urgency of addressing this issue, not just for the environment, but also for economic and social reasons. In fact, as a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, Iraq is committed to collectively reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, which could have a significant impact on global methane levels and climate change mitigation [2].\n\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also lead to economic benefits. The Iraq Progresses on Fossil Fuel Methane Regulation report states that an increasing number of major oil-producing countries, including Iraq, are taking action on methane emissions as the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce the rate of warming before 2030 [2]. Additionally, reducing methane emissions can also provide economic savings, as captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs [1].", "user_utterance": "Could you please explain how methane emissions are currently impacting the economies of countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq?", "search_queries": ["Methane emissions impact on economy in Venezuela", "Methane management practices in Turkmenistan", "Economic benefits of reducing methane emissions in Iraq"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://iraq.un.org/en/124015-iraq-mulls-tackling-its-methane-problem-and-reaping-major-benefits-along-way", "description": "The drive to solve Iraq\u2019s methane challenge received a welcome boost with the ratification by the Iraqi Parliament of the Paris Agreement on 22 September.

This is evident in initiatives such as the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched at COP26 by the European Union and the United States and has since been joined by numerous other countries. The pledge aims to leverage the reduction of methane emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste as a way to achieve near-term gains in the global effort to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u02daC.\n\nIn addition to the ethical responsibility of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship, there are also economic incentives for countries to improve their methane management practices. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that achieving all methane pledges made by countries and companies would cut emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030. This could lead to economic savings from reduced emissions and the potential for captured methane to be used as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs.\n\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that need to be overcome in order for countries to effectively reduce methane emissions. This is where international support mechanisms can play a crucial role. The Biden administration, for example, has announced new actions to support the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, including $1.15B from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create jobs capping wells. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Methane Assessment shows that there are existing technologies and policy frameworks that can be implemented cost-effectively and with immediate benefits to society.\n\nIt is also important to consider the human angle in this issue. Local communities living near sources of methane emissions are disproportionately affected by air pollution and can benefit from improved air quality. This provides an emotionally compelling narrative and highlights the importance of addressing methane emissions for the well-being of communities.\n\nIn conclusion, there are various international support mechanisms and incentives that can help countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to methane emission management. These include the Global Methane Pledge, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, and national methane action plans, among others.", "user_utterance": "Could you describe the types of international support mechanisms that are available or being developed to help countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to methane emission management?", "search_queries": ["International support for methane emission management", "Infrastructure and technological barriers to methane emissions", "Economic benefits of reducing methane emissions"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/curbing-methane-emissions-how-five-industries-can-counter-a-major-climate-threat", "description": "The five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management. In each of these industries, there is a solid economic case to take abatement action. In this article, we look at methane\u2019s impact on the climate, potential ...", "snippets": ["As global temperatures continue to rise and physical climate hazards become increasingly frequent and intense, more and more organizations are committing to lower their greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Carbon dioxide commands much of their attention, but methane emissions from human activity are the second-largest driver of global warming, accounting for roughly 30 percent of the temperature increase from preindustrial levels. Curbing emissions of methane, therefore, will be critical to solving the net-zero equation\u2014that is, reducing GHG emissions as much as possible, and counterbalancing any remaining emissions with GHG removals\u2014and stabilizing the climate.", "Oil and gas\nOil and gas accounts for an estimated 20 to 25 percent of anthropogenic methane. Our analysis suggests that the sector could achieve a 40 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 73 percent reduction by 2050. The oil and gas industry emits \u201cfugitive methane\u201d through venting, leaks, and incomplete combustion during flaring. Since methane is the primary constituent of natural gas, these emissions are an untapped source of value, contingent on the necessary infrastructure being put in place. Moreover, there are numerous options to prevent losses in upstream production, including LDAR, equipment electrification or replacement, instrument air systems, and vapor-recovery units.\nCoal mining", ". Several companies are already commercializing feed additives for cattle, for example, while alternative approaches to water, soil carbon, nitrogen, and land management provide proven options to rice and crop farmers.", "The priority, therefore, is for action where it is practical. Many of the solutions can be implemented at a relatively low or net-negative cost, and these should be a priority. Where costs are prohibitive, there is a need for coordinated action to create the infrastructure and fiscal conditions that would support further action. Across the board, there is a need for more monitoring, reporting, and verification, more support for consumer choices, and more dedication to funding technical solutions. Without these efforts, it is likely that current initiatives will fail and the planet will continue on its collision course with an uncertain and dangerous future.", ". On the other hand, if methane emissions can be cut quickly, there will be a sufficient carbon budget remaining for the global economy to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero in an orderly transition (Exhibit 1).", "Full deployment of the abatement measures described here would cost an estimated $60 billion to $110 billion annually up to 2030, $150 billion to $220 billion annually by 2040, and $230 billion to $340 billion annually by 2050. These estimates include capital investments, operational costs and savings, as well as potential revenues from recovered methane. Cumulatively, the cost of adopting all technical levers would amount to $3.3 trillion to $5.1 trillion over a 30-year period (Exhibit 5).\nOn 2030 and 2050 horizons, estimated emissions reductions by industry are as follows:\nAgriculture", "- Expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. First, there must be a concerted effort to expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. To get there, governments and industries would need to upgrade data collection, moving from estimates to observed measurements. Satellite, drone, and sensor monitoring, the costs of which are falling sharply, would be one way to help achieve this. Currently, methane emissions are reported in tandem with CO2 emissions. That needs to change, with methane described under its own methodology. Better measurement would offer the potential to create incentives for rapid methane reduction across industries. It could also support efforts to develop global tradable goods markets that value the carbon intensity of products along a traceable value chain.", "It is also important to note that reducing methane emissions in time to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway would require both shifts in demand for commodities and technical solutions (Exhibit 3). The need for action on multiple fronts makes it all the more important to understand the feasibility of technical solutions, which we explore below.\nIndustries could reduce methane emissions with proven technologies at a manageable cost\nDespite practical hurdles, technical abatement solutions are available now across the five industries, and many rely on existing technologies and would support companies as they progress toward their net-zero targets. Moreover, on a 30-year timeline, our analysis shows that more than 90 percent of the potential emissions reductions associated with these solutions could be achieved at a cost of less than $25 per ton of carbon-dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)\u2014a price sometimes paid in the voluntary carbon markets (Exhibit 4).", "In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world\u2019s budget to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C was 570 gigatons (or 570 billion tons) of carbon dioxide (GtCO2).4 Human activities currently emit about 41 GtCO2 a year, which suggests the budget will be exhausted by 2031. A core element of the IPCC\u2019s analysis is that pathways to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are accompanied by deep reductions in emissions of methane. This means that the more methane that gets emitted, the less \u201croom\u201d there will be in the atmosphere for other GHGs. Put another way, if methane emissions stay high, the world\u2019s carbon budget will soon be spent. The IPCC analysis assumes curtailment of methane emissions of more than 2 percent a year, reaching 37 percent below 2017 levels by 2030 and 55 percent by 2050.5 If these targets aren\u2019t met, the 1.5\u00b0C objective will effectively be beyond reach", "As a result of these challenges, and despite recent technology advancements, methane emissions are notoriously difficult to track and measure. In addition, abatement solutions are rarely cut and dried. Across sectors, abatement measures vary widely in terms of cost per metric ton of methane abated, feasibility, and ease of implementation. Most measures require trade-offs, either between costs and benefits or in terms of environmental impact. Dry seeding in rice farming, for instance, will cut emissions associated with flooding but may boost emissions of nitrous oxide, another GHG. The cost of methane abatement in coal mining is four to five times higher than that of leak detection and repair (LDAR) in oil and gas, because the concentration of methane in released from coal mines is much lower.7 This creates an uneven playing field that may challenge the business case for methane abatement at individual companies.", "The agriculture sector, which emits an estimated 40 to 50 percent of anthropogenic methane, could achieve a 12 percent reduction in these emissions by 2030 and a 30 percent reduction by 2050. Agricultural emissions are primarily the result of ruminant animals (principally cows and sheep), farming practices, and rice production. Ruminants create methane during digestion, along with CO2 and other gasses. The impact is significant: ruminants account for almost 70 percent of agricultural emissions. They are responsible globally for more carbon-dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions than every country except China.8 Elsewhere in agriculture, biomass burning is a moderate source of emissions, driven by the expansion of land for pasture and crops, while rice farming produces methane via mechanical flooding, which is used in many countries to manage pests. A large proportion of the emissions from agriculture could be addressed with existing technologies", "Coal mining produces an estimated 10 to 15 percent of anthropogenic methane. According to our analysis, the sector has the potential to achieve a 2 percent reduction in its methane emissions by 2030 and a 13 percent reduction by 2050. The vast majority of coal-mine-methane (CMM) emissions emanate from either working or abandoned deep mines. There is a significant challenge in measuring and recovering these emissions. However, established technologies can capture CMM and use it to generate power. The investment case is probably strongest for companies in China, which account for about 70 percent of CMM emissions and which have invested in coal gasification for the industrial sector.\nSolid waste", "- Support sustainable consumption. Stakeholders could develop mechanisms to differentiate assets and score products based on their methane footprints. If every kilogram of rice, million British thermal units (MMBtu) of natural gas, ton of steel, pound of meat, barrel of oil, and ton of coal came with a methane-intensity label, the market signals could support a more orderly decarbonization transition. With this, retailers and consumers could make more informed purchasing decisions, producers could define new foundations for competitive advantage, and investors could better understand portfolio risk.", "The bad news is that methane emissions have risen by about 25 percent in the past 20 years. The current trajectory is far off the 2 percent annual decline that would be required to meet the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C warming objectives of the Paris Agreement.1 However, there are reasons for cautious optimism. New McKinsey research shows that five industries could reduce global annual methane emissions by 20 percent by 2030 and 46 percent by 2050\u2014enough for a significant shift toward a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway. What\u2019s more, these reductions could be achieved largely with established technologies and at a reasonable cost.", "- Increase innovation. Many solutions are sufficiently developed to be effective but are not adopted at scale because of excessive costs or a lack of awareness of available technology. In the oil and gas industry, innovation in methane monitoring\u2014for example, leveraging flyovers and on-ground detection\u2014could help businesses pinpoint leaks and cut mitigation costs. The beef industry is in the early stages of adopting feed additives, genetic breeding, and methane capture. These technologies would benefit from support to move more speedily from lab to field.", "Accounting for an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane, the solid-waste sector could achieve a 39 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 91 percent reduction by 2050. The majority of methane emissions from waste originates in landfills and open dumps, where anaerobic organic material generates methane over time. Through biogas markets and other incentives, authorities could capture these emissions and either sell the methane as renewable natural gas or use it in the production of fertilizer. However, revenues may not be sufficient to offset the costs.\nWastewater", "The five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management. In each of these industries, there is a solid economic case to take abatement action. In this article, we look at methane\u2019s impact on the climate, potential ways to reduce emissions, and steps that companies can take to begin managing methane effectively.\nReducing methane emissions is essential to stopping climate change\u2014but some barriers stand in the way", "While methane and CO2 have similar warming effects, they are contrasting in several aspects. Methane stays in the atmosphere for just a decade, compared with the centuries-long persistence of CO2, but traps many times more heat. Methane emissions are much more irregular, emitted intermittently from oil wells, cattle, landfills, and coal mines.6 Another challenge is that sources of methane emissions are highly dispersed across and within the five industries that account for the majority of methane emissions from human activities (Exhibit 2). Agriculture creates 40 to 50 percent of global methane emissions, but these emissions come from millions of farms of different sizes and farming practices around the world.", "The insights here demonstrate that abating methane emissions will be critical to achieving a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway and avoiding the worst effects of climate change. The good news is that there are many practical solutions available. Feed additives for cattle, new rice-farming techniques, advanced approaches to oil and gas leak detection, coal methane capture, and modern water and waste facilities can all be effective. Still, these solutions face implementation challenges.", "Global temperatures in 2021 are 1.1\u00b0C higher than preindustrial levels, with anthropogenic methane emissions responsible for 30 percent of that warming.2 As temperatures continue to rise, there is a danger that climate feedbacks could accelerate the warming impact of methane from sources in the Arctic, wetlands, and landfills. In the Arctic, permafrost releases methane as it thaws. On the current emissions trajectory, permafrost release alone could add an incremental 5 to 20 percent to long-term methane emissions.3", "The wastewater sector now emits an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane. These emissions could be reduced 27 percent by 2030 and 77 percent by 2050. Wastewater emits methane from the breakdown of organic material in wastewater streams. The primary method of reducing emissions would be to build out modern sanitation infrastructure and technology. However, capital costs and policy requirements would be a significant burden in many countries. Where there is funding and access to technology, alternative abatement approaches could include the use of covered lagoons or the application of microalgae to prevent gas formation. Biosolids responsible for producing methane could be collected and sold as fertilizer or bioenergy.\nCompanies can take three no-regrets actions to begin reducing methane emissions\nTo begin reducing methane emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, some essential groundwork is required, comprising three no-regret actions:"], "title": "Curbing methane emissions: How five industries can counter a major ..."}, {"url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/31/fact-sheet-biden-administration-tackles-super-polluting-methane-emissions/", "description": "The Department of Energy announcing the launch of a Methane Reduction Infrastructure Initiative to provide technical assistance to the orphaned well clean-up efforts of Federal agencies, states ...", "snippets": ["As part of a new $4.7 billion orphan wells clean up program established under President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Department of the Interior today announced $1.15 billion is available for states to begin cleaning up thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells that are hazardous to the health and safety of communities across the country.

Major emitters of methane from coal mines, both countries and companies, need to increase action on reducing emissions in this area. Sectors which rely on coal for inputs, such as the steel sector, could work to incentivise methane emissions reductions in their downstream suppliers as well.\nThe gap between high-level commitments and detailed implementation plans is visible across the board.

This has led to increased efforts from major emitters, including the United States and the European Union, to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. [1][2]\n\nIn terms of economic impact, methane emissions can have both negative and positive effects. On the negative side, methane leaks can pose explosion hazards and affect air quality, which can have detrimental effects on local communities. However, on the positive side, reducing methane emissions can lead to economic savings. [3]\n\nOne potential economic benefit is the use of captured methane as a clean energy source, which can potentially lead to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. This is supported by the Global Methane Assessment, which states that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective strategies to reduce the rate of warming and contribute to global efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. [4]\n\nFurthermore, addressing methane emissions can also have additional benefits for human health, food security, and ecosystems. The report highlights that reducing methane emissions can curb the formation of tropospheric ozone, a dangerous air pollutant, and have immediate benefits to society. [4]\n\nHowever, there are also infrastructural and technological barriers that these countries may face in reducing methane emissions. This can be seen in the United States, which had the world's highest methane emissions from oil and gas production in 2022. [7] This highlights the need for international support and cooperation to help these countries overcome these barriers.\n\nIn terms of policy incentives or penalties, there are already efforts in place to incentivize countries to reduce their methane emissions. For instance, the report by the International Energy Agency states that the reduction of methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change and is critical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.

Jacob", "The new, more accurate emissions information comes at a crucial moment as countries work to calculate their greenhouse gas reduction targets in accordance with international agreements and national policies, and as industry groups also work to reduce emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, signatories produce nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are reduction pledges for pollutants including methane. Under the Global Methane Pledge, coauthored by the United States and the European Union in 2021, 125 countries have now agreed to help reduce aggregate global methane emissions by nearly a third from 2020 levels by 2030. The countries participating in this pledge account for nearly 50% of global anthropogenic methane emissions and about two-thirds of global gross domestic product. If they maintain their pledges that could reduce warming by 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050", ". And the Methane Guiding Principles, a voluntary initiative to reduce methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain, was launched in 2017 by some of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, including BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron."], "title": "Methane's role in climate change - Harvard John A.

For the first time, the pledge sets the floor for what\u2019s necessary to curb this dangerous climate pollutant over the next decade.", "This announcement couldn\u2019t come soon enough, because cutting methane emissions is essential to keep global temperature rise from breaching the critical 1.5 degrees C threshold, in addition to steep cuts in carbon dioxide. Despite the urgency to address these pollutants, however, methane emissions continue to rise globally, with 2020 seeing the highest atmospheric concentration of methane ever. Recent reports, such as the Global Methane Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report, also underscore the need for fast action to reduce methane.", "The good news is that acting on methane comes with tremendous benefits, helping to limit near-term temperature rise and improve air quality, leading to better public health outcomes and improved food security. These actions can often be implemented at zero or low cost, providing significant economic benefits for governments and companies. In fact, in several cases, the actions reap cost savings after the initial investments are paid off. Many of the mitigation measures are also readily-available across all major methane emitting sectors \u2014 energy, agriculture and waste \u2014 providing an excellent solution for governments to meet climate and development goals.\nWhy is Reducing Methane Emissions Important?", "Methane is the second most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG), and is 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years in the atmosphere (34 times more powerful over 100 years). Because it exists for a relatively short time in the atmosphere, cutting methane provides a quick benefit in terms of limiting near-term temperature rise. Studies estimate that ambitious actions to reduce methane can avoid 0.3 degrees C of warming by 2050.\nReducing methane also helps to improve air quality, as it is a pre-cursor to ground-level ozone, a damaging air pollutant that harms human health and crop yields. Readily-available methane mitigation measures can also prevent more than 250,000 premature deaths and 26 million tons of crop losses annually.\nHow Can Methane Emissions be Reduced?", "Twelve countries are responsible for around two-thirds of global methane emissions: China, Russia, India, the United States, Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Mexico, Australia and Nigeria.\nMost human-caused methane emissions stem from three sectors \u2014 energy (35%), agriculture (40%) and waste (20%) \u2014 so a focus on action in these sectors can help to stave off immediate warming impacts.\nEnergy\nThe energy sector is responsible for more than a third of global methane emissions, with oil and gas contributing the lion\u2019s share (around 14%). Methane emissions occur along the entire oil and gas supply chain, but especially from fugitive emissions from leaking equipment, system upsets, and deliberate flaring and venting.\nExisting cost-effective solutions can help reduce emissions, including initiating leak detection and repair programs, implementing better technologies and operating practices, and capturing and utilizing methane that would otherwise be wasted.", "The International Energy Agency estimates around 75% of total oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided using currently available technologies, with more than half of these reductions at zero net cost. But despite the clear economic case for sealing leaks, utilities often recoup the costs of leaked gas by passing them on to consumers. Voluntary coalitions are, however, coming together to work toward lowering methane emissions in the sector, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.\nFood Systems\nAgriculture is the largest contributor to global methane emissions, producing about 40% of these emissions, primarily from enteric fermentation (cow burps), rice cultivation and manure management.", "Improved agricultural production practices \u2014 specifically focused on improving efficiency \u2014 can enhance livestock and crop yields, provide more income for farmers, while at the same time reduce methane emissions per unit output. In areas where emission reductions are more difficult to achieve, like enteric fermentation, groups such as the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate and the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases are helping spur greater innovation and technology deployment.\nReducing food loss and waste is another important area. Roughly one third of all food produced is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain, with agricultural production responsible for the greatest amount, exacerbating food insecurity in vulnerable nations. These losses are due to many factors, including spillage or degradation during production.", "If counted as a country, food loss and waste would be the third largest source of GHG emissions after China and the United States. But food producers and consumers can take immediate steps to reduce food waste immediately \u2014 from improving inventory systems, changing food date labelling practices and better facilitating the sale or donation of perishable products.\nSmall shifts in diet choices, particularly away from beef, can also make an impact globally, both in terms of freeing up agricultural land and reducing methane emissions. However, meeting today\u2019s announced pledge does not necessarily depend on these diet shifts, according to data in the Global Methane Assessment.\nMunicipal Solid Waste", "The waste sector accounts for around 20% of global human-caused methane emissions. Luckily, cost-effective mitigation solutions do exist, with the greatest potential related to separating organics and recycling which can also create new jobs. Upstream avoidance of food loss and waste is also key.\nAdditionally, capturing landfill gas and generating energy will reduce methane emissions, displace other forms of fuels and create new streams of revenue. The EPA projects that landfill gas utilization will remain the cheapest solution to mitigate emissions in the waste sector, often implemented at zero net cost. However, projects require high upfront capital costs which can sometimes be a deterrent in poorer jurisdictions.\nWhich Countries are Already Committed to Reduce Methane?", "Outside of the newly announced global pledge, several countries have taken on individual commitments to tackle methane. In the last two years, for example, Nigeria and Cote D\u2019Ivoire have committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 45% by 2025 and 60-75% by 2030. The European Union has adopted an economy-wide methane strategy, with its accompanying models indicating that the region will need to limit methane emissions by 35-37% by 2030 relative to 2005 to meet its overall climate commitment. New Zealand aims to reduce biogenic methane emissions by 10% by 2030, and 24-47% by 2050, both relative to 2017 levels.\nWhat to Look Out for Next?", "The announcement of a global pledge to reduce methane emissions represents an important step forward \u2014 the first time that countries will collectively commit to acting to address methane across all sectors of their economies. At the same time, several countries are also finalizing their updated national climate action plans (the nationally determined contributions), where ambitious commitments to address methane should also be included \u2014 helping to keep the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals within reach and ensure a safer future for all."], "title": "5 Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Global Methane Emissions | World ..."}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction/methane-explained", "description": "measure and report emissions through the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 framework, achieve near-zero absolute methane emissions by 2030 by reducing methane intensity to below 0.2%, and. achieve zero routine flaring by 2030.

This makes methane second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.\nWhile methane has a significantly higher GWP than carbon dioxide, it also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, and so after about 12 years, the methane in the atmosphere breaks down into GHGs with a lower GWP. In contrast, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for over a century.\nAs a result, the rapid reduction of methane emissions is:\none of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change,\ncritical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels; and\nprobably the single most important climate action we can undertake in the short-term.", "How does oil and gas production contribute to methane emissions?\nThe global energy sector accounted for approximately 40% of global anthropogenic methane emissions in 2021, with the oil and gas industry representing over 60% of the emissions from the energy sector, and industry estimates suggest that methane emissions from fossil fuels have been increasing in recent years.\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant source of methane emissions globally. In fact, methane emissions from venting, leakage, and flaring in the oil and gas sector are currently estimated to be responsible for roughly 25% of global anthropogenic methane emissions. Oil and gas operations release methane into the atmosphere through the wasteful practices of intentional flaring and venting, as well as through the unintentional release of fugitive methane emissions.\nMethane from fugitive emissions", "During the production and transportation of natural gas (associated or non-associated gas), leaks and unintentional releases result in methane escaping into the atmosphere. While gas composition varies, natural gas typically comprises about 80-95 percent methane, with the remaining comprising heavier hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, and butane.\nIn recent years the scale of these fugitive emissions has become apparent, with advances in methane detection technology allowing previously undetected leaks to be identified. These leaks, typically resulting from poor maintenance and broken equipment, can release enormous amounts of methane and are often labeled \u201csuper-emitters.\u201d\nMethane from flaring\nFlares are a direct source of methane emissions, as flares do not completely combust all the hydrocarbons in the gas stream, but by how much is not well understood.\nTypically, greenhouse gas (GHG) estimates of gas flaring emissions are based on two core assumptions:", "that flares have a methane destruction efficiency of 98%, resulting in 2% of the methane in the flare gas stream being emitted to the atmosphere un-combusted; and\nthat flares are lit and operating properly 100% of the time.\nThese assumptions, used widely for decades across the oil and gas industry, have formed the foundation of estimates of GHG emissions from flaring, and using them we estimate that in 2023 flaring resulted in 381 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions (MMtCO2e), of which 336 MMtCO2e was in the form of carbon dioxide and 45 MMtCO2e was in the form of uncombusted methane.\nHowever, until recently, neither of these assumptions had been rigorously tested in real-world operational environments. GFMR has developed an interactive toolkit to help demonstrate the likely GHG emissions from flaring across a range of circumstances.", "The 98% value for flare destruction efficiency is attributed to controlled studies conducted on behalf of the United States EPA as far back as the 1980s. To date, flare destruction efficiency has not been widely field-tested because direct measurement in realworld environments is highly complex and problematic. However, given its importance in understanding the methane emissions associated with flaring, it has become a critical area of research.\nIn 2022, a paper was published in Science detailing the findings of a field campaign in the United States to measure flare destruction efficiency. The study found an average destruction efficiency of 95.2% facilities in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken basins, considerably lower than the default 98% commonly used.\nMethane from venting", "Venting sometimes occurs as a result of faulty flaring equipment and unlit flares. However, in the absence of flaring equipment or the infrastructure to bring the gas to market, some operators choose to deliberately and routinely vent gas. Given the high methane content of associated gas and methane\u2019s high GWP, venting is a particularly polluting industry practice that can be easily and cost-effectively addressed with existing technologies.\nIn another study, researchers found that 3.2% of the flares assessed in the Bakken were operating unlit, i.e., directly venting gas, including methane, to the atmosphere. Using these findings and building on an earlier study in the Permian that found that 5% of the flare assessed were unlit, the study estimates an average of 4.1% of flares may typically be unlit across all three basins.", "Bringing together the measured destruction efficiency of 95.2% and the prevalence of unlit flares, the researchers suggest that flares in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken actually operate with an \u2018effective\u2019 destruction efficiency of 91.1%. If these findings are widespread across the US, let alone world, the true scale of the contribution of gas flaring to methane emissions could be hugely underestimated.\nWhile oil and gas operations are a significant source of methane and carbon dioxide emissions globally, the industry is also well placed to quickly respond to and address emissions through flaring and venting reduction and tackling fugitive methane emissions.\nHow can we reduce the amount of methane emitted?", "Taking quick and decisive action on methane from oil and gas operations could avoid as much as 0.1 degrees C of warming by mid-century\u2014equivalent to zeroing out the emissions of every car and truck in the world. Cutting methane emissions is low-hanging fruit in tackling climate change. It is vital to aligning the global energy sector with a global 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory.\nTackling fugitive methane emissions and unlit flares (venting) requires the development of new technologies capable of not only detecting methane but of accurately measuring these emissions. The accuracy of detection and measurement technologies has increased dramatically over the last few years. Still, effective leak detection and repair (LDAR) often requires using several complementary approaches, from satellites and aerial surveillance down to on-the-ground teams operating handheld devices.", "In addition, flare elimination efforts also support methane reductions from other sources, such as venting and fugitive releases. Without an outlet to export or utilize the gas, any methane conserved from these sources will ultimately be sent to flare, and while there may be an overall emissions reduction, methane is still released, and this energy source is still wasted. This highlights the importance of flare reduction and gas management to overall oil and gas decarbonization strategies.\nAt any given time, flares may be:\nlit and operating effectively;\nlit and operating ineffectively, with incomplete\ncombustion of methane;\nunlit and active, venting methane directly to the\natmosphere; or\nunlit and inactive, with no associated emissions.\nResearch has revealed that the destruction efficiency of a flare is likely to be a product of many factors, including flare gas composition, flow rate, flare system design, operation and maintenance and local environmental factors such as wind speed.", "While research continues, there are three critical steps operators can take now to reduce methane emissions from flaring:\nEnsure flares are always lit and have automatic systems to re-ignite if they should go out.\nEnsure flares are operating effectively and optimize flare destruction efficiency.\nReduce and ultimately eliminate the gas going to the flare, which should be the end goal.\nWhat is being done about methane emissions from oil and gas operations?\nCutting methane from oil and gas production is low-hanging fruit in tackling climate change, and critical to aligning the global energy sector with a global 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory, as agreed in the Global Methane Pledge launched at COP26.\nDespite this, methane abatement solutions are underfunded, considering their climate change mitigation potential, and low- and middle-income oil-producing countries need technical and financial support to implement methane reduction projects and policies.", "Flaring and methane reductions can be achieved with currently available technology. However, in the case of flaring, the World Bank\u2019s most recent Global Gas Flaring Tracker report shows that gas flaring continues unabated in many countries, despite available technology.\nFor the last two decades the World Bank\u2019s Global Gas Flaring reduction Partnership (GGFR) provided technical advice and support to help developing countries end routine gas flaring, which is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Launched at COP28 in December 2023, the GFMR Partnership builds on this legacy and has expanded the World Bank\u2019s efforts to decarbonize the global energy system by also helping reduce the methane emissions associated with oil and gas production.", "GFMR works with developing countries to end gas flaring and methane emissions as part of their journey to a low-carbon future, and supports their efforts to avoid wasting a valuable natural resource that could help accelerate economic development and improve energy access. By 2030, this new fund will disburse more than $250 million to support methane mitigation efforts and expects to leverage billions more in public and private sector finance.\nWe advise governments and operators on the technical solutions and regulations which will contribute to finally ending gas flaring and venting. This includes providing technical assistance, enabling policy and regulatory reform, institutional strengthening, and mobilizing financing to support action by governments and operators.", "GFMR applies clear eligibility criteria so that support to developing countries drives long term emissions reduction projects and initiatives. For example, access to project development and financing support through GFMR will be subject to a commitment to\nmeasure and report emissions through the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 framework,\nachieve near-zero absolute methane emissions by 2030 by reducing methane intensity to below 0.2%, and\nachieve zero routine flaring by 2030.\nThe World Bank and GFMR are also supporting organizations for the Methane Guiding Principles, a coalition of industry, multilateral institutions, non-governmental organizations, and academia working together to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector.\nOn effective flare operation, GFMR and partners in the Methane Guiding Principles initiative recently published a Methane Flaring Toolkit, which seeks to provide important technologies and solutions to reduce methane emissions from flaring.", "We continue to encourage all operators and governments to commit to the World Bank\u2019s Zero Routine Flaring (ZRF) initiative, which aims to end the 160-year-old industry practice. We have also published several important knowledge products to support flaring and venting reduction, including our comprehensive review of Global Flaring and Venting Regulations, Financing Solutions to Reduce Natural Gas Flaring and Methane Emissions and, in partnership with IPIECA and IOGP, the Flaring Management Guidance for the O&G Industry.\nGas flaring is the burning of the natural gas associated with oil extraction. The practice has persisted since the beginning of oil production over 160 years ago. It takes place due to a range of issues.\nFor Faith Nwadishi and her community in Nigeria, gas flaring negatively impacts their fundamental way of life. She tells us why this oil and gas industry practice must end as soon as possible. #EndRoutineFlaring", "The Methane Flaring Toolkit provides practical advice and information on the effective measurement and monitoring of methane emissions from gas flares in the oil and gas industry.\nThis guidance, developed with Ipieca and IOGP, outlines new flaring management and reduction developments, and examines industry experiences with eliminating flaring, new technologies, business models, operational improvements, and regulatory policy.\nThe World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Tracker is the only global and independent indicator of routine gas flaring. The estimates allow us to monitor global flaring levels and track progress toward our goal of Zero Routine Flaring by 2030.\nGFMR\u2019s global regulatory review provides a systematic analysis of regulatory frameworks governing the flaring and venting of gas in 21 oil-producing countries.

Key findings: EMISSIONS ARE INCREASING The atmospheric concentration of methane has more than doubled since pre-industrial times. Methane is second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) in driving climate change. More than half of global methane emissions stem from human activities in three sectors: fossil fuels (35% of human-caused emissions), waste (20%) and agriculture (40%). Image Image Mitigation potential in different sectors varies between countries and regions. The majority of the major abatement potentials can be achieved at low cost, less than US$ 600 per tonne of methane, especially in the waste sector and coal subsector in most regions and the oil and gas subsector in North America. OPPORTUNITIES TO ACT NOW Image The relatively short atmospheric lifetime of methane, combined with its strong warming potential, means that actions to reduce emissions can provide benefits within a few decades", ". Quick action would help limit dangerous climate feedback loops, while simultaneously delivering important health and economic benefits from reducing tropospheric ozone. To put the world on a path consistent with the Paris Agreement 1.5\u02daC target, methane emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 relative to projected levels (~35-40% relative to current emissions). This can be achieved using solutions available today. Targeted methane measures can reduce 2030 emissions by 30%. Additional measures that do not primarily target methane can reduce 2030 emissions by ~15%. Image BENEFITS OUTWEIGH COST OF ACTION More than 60% of available targeted measures have low mitigation costs, and roughly half of those have negative costs.

Bottom-up approaches can use activity data (e.g., the number of facilities or the extent of operations) multiplied by standardised emission factors (e.g., default values or leak rates for particular types of equipment).

Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 around 12 years compared with centuries \u2013 but absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere.\nMethane also affects air quality because it can lead to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, a dangerous pollutant.

They also enable regional estimates of total methane emissions over longer periods of time.\nNew satellites are being developed that will provide higher resolution, greater coverage, and have more sensitive detection thresholds. These include instruments such as GHGSat, EnMAP, Carbon Mapper, SBG, CHIME and EMIT and MethaneSAT that aim to deliver high-resolution images for selected high-priority areas. These will improve methane quantification capabilities, raise public awareness and support regulatory oversight.", "The growing evidence base and the International Methane Emissions Observatory\nIncomplete information about actual emissions levels and a lack of awareness of the cost-effectiveness of abatement is a key barrier to reducing methane emissions. In response, a growing number of recent initiatives aim to measure and report current and historical emissions from facilities, production types and countries. Yet these assessments remain incomplete \u2013 most countries and regions still have little or no measurement-based data and the data they provide often require careful processing. These gaps highlight the need for robust and transparent data evaluation and harmonisation of estimates.", "In 2022, IMEO launched the Methane Alert and Response System, a global system connecting satellite methane detection to transparent notification processes in order to promote on-the-ground emissions mitigation efforts. This system aims to identify major emissions events, activate its partners to notify relevant stakeholders, and support and track progress toward mitigation. Satellites detected more than 500 very large leaks from fossil fuel operations in 20 countries. A small portion of these were from coal, likely because coal mine methane emissions are often diffuse and therefore harder to detect.\nSatellite-detected large leaks from fossil fuel operations, 2022\nOpenSatellites are providing a major boost to our understanding of emissions", "With fossil fuels, methane emissions can occur at any point during production, processing and transport. In addition to these emissions, we include emissions from the end use of coal, oil products and natural gas in the Global Methane Tracker (3 Mt or 3% of energy-related methane). This estimate is based on the emissions factors published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for energy consumption in homes, industries and in the transport sector. Some measurement campaigns have suggested that these emissions factors could significantly underestimate actual emissions across different end-use environments, including in industry, cities and households. These are areas with very high levels of uncertainty and our estimates will continue to be updated as the evidence base grows.", "Methane leaks can occur along the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain and there is increasing evidence that they could be a small but important source of emissions. Leaks can occur at liquefaction facilities from gas service valves, reciprocating compressors, pump seals or metering equipment as well as during the transfer of LNG from the facility to the ship. During shipping, methane leaks can also occur if \u201cboil-off\u201d gas (a small fraction of the LNG cargo that evaporates) is vented or is used as propulsion and not fully combusted in the ship\u2019s engines.", "New technology development has allowed satellites to detect methane emissions in offshore areas for the first time in 2022, but this has not yet become part of routine monitoring efforts, and there is still a high degree of uncertainty over estimates derived from satellite readings of emissions from offshore events. Emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were one of the first offshore leaks to be quantified using satellite data. A working paper from the International Methane Emissions Observatory estimates emissions from this event were between 75 and 230 thousand tonnes of methane.\nDetection of methane emissions from the Nord Stream leak", "Data from the European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-5P, processed by the earth analytics firm Kayrros, indicates that during 2022 there were around 70 countries where methane emissions from oil and gas operations could have been detected for at least 15 days. Large emission events were observed in 20 of these countries in 2022. Coverage tended to be best in the Middle East, parts of Central Asia and Australia, where it was possible to make a direct observation every 3-5 days. On the remaining days, cloud coverage or other interference prevented observations from taking place. Accounting for the level of satellite coverage, observed very large leaks are estimated to have emitted around 3 Mt of methane from oil and gas operations in 2022 (6% of our estimate of oil and gas emissions in the 20 countries where events were detected).", "Based on detailed data on global LNG trade and the sample of satellite readings of LNG liquefaction facilities from GHGSat, we estimate total fugitive methane emissions from LNG liquefaction and shipping in 2022 to be around 0.4 Mt, equivalent to around 0.1% of total annual LNG transported globally. Shipping makes up the majority of emissions and the main route to reduce associated methane is by ensuring that boil-off gas is injected into engines or reliquefied rather than vented. Manufacturers are increasingly promoting technologies that reduce methane slip (gas that is not fully combusted in ships\u2019 engines), for example by recirculating exhaust gases, using high-pressure direct injection or methane oxidation catalysts.\nThe IEA Global Methane Tracker is our effort to provide a coherent set of estimates for the energy sector based on the best available data", "Satellite technologies are not perfect. They can struggle to provide readings in many environments such as offshore areas, mountain ranges, snowy or ice-covered regions, and at high latitudes. Satellites are also impaired by cloud cover, even if only a portion of the monitored area is covered, limiting the number of days when detections can be made. For example, countries with dense forests or in equatorial regions, such as Nigeria or Venezuela, are very often cloudy, hindering observation efforts.", "There are large differences between data based on measurement campaigns and scientific studies, and the emissions levels reported by official public bodies, such as to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which rarely make use of direct measurements. This mismatch exists at both global and national levels and for all sources of emissions. Many official greenhouse gas submissions to the UNFCCC have not been updated for years, and, even for those that have, many of these inventories are not yet accurate enough to provide a clear picture of emissions.\nGlobal methane emissions reported to the UNFCCC and estimates from the IEA, 2022", "The IEA produces and publishes country-level estimates for energy-related methane emissions and abatement options as part of our IEA Global Methane Tracker.

This includes company reporting through the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Framework, direct measurements from peer-reviewed studies, satellite observations, and national inventories. These empirically verified data will be provided in a public dataset to inform companies, governments, investors, and civil society as they work together to track methane emissions levels and abatement efforts. The IEA strongly supports IMEO and maintains an ongoing dialogue with the Secretariat and the Scientific Oversight Committee.", "The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently over two-and-a-half times greater than its pre-industrial levels.

As we know, methane emissions are a major contributor to global warming and addressing them is crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change. When it comes to countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, there are several key infrastructural and financial challenges that they face in implementing methane capture and reduction technologies in their oil and gas sectors.\n\nOne of the main challenges is the lack of necessary infrastructure to capture and transport methane. This can be attributed to the fact that these countries have long relied on flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas. Flaring, however, releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere and contributes to the overall emissions. Building the necessary infrastructure for capturing and transporting methane requires significant investment, which can be a financial barrier for these countries.\n\nIn addition, there may be political and economic factors at play that hinder the adoption of methane reduction technologies. For example, in Venezuela, the current economic crisis and political instability may make it difficult to prioritize investing in new technologies for reducing methane emissions. In Turkmenistan, the government's control over the oil and gas sector may make it challenging for private companies to invest in new technologies.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of technical expertise and knowledge in these countries. Implementing new technologies for methane reduction requires trained professionals and specialized equipment, which may not be readily available. This can further increase the cost and complexity of adopting these technologies.\n\nFurthermore, there may be regulatory barriers that hinder progress in reducing methane emissions. In some cases, the lack of regulations or enforcement may not incentivize companies to invest in reducing their methane emissions. In others, strict regulations may make it difficult for companies to comply, especially if they do not have the necessary resources and expertise.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there have been recent efforts to address these challenges. For example, the Biden-Harris administration in the United States has announced new rules and regulations to cut methane emissions and provide incentives for companies to invest in reducing their emissions. These efforts can serve as an example for other countries, and international support and partnerships can play a crucial role in helping countries overcome the infrastructural and financial challenges they face.", "user_utterance": "Could you explain the key infrastructural and financial challenges that countries such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq face when trying to implement methane capture and reduction technologies in their oil and gas sectors?", "search_queries": ["How are countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq addressing methane emissions in their oil and gas industries?", "What are the economic benefits of reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector?", "What are the current infrastructural and technological barriers to implementing methane capture and reduction technologies?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/curbing-methane-emissions-how-five-industries-can-counter-a-major-climate-threat", "description": "The five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management.

Carbon dioxide commands much of their attention, but methane emissions from human activity are the second-largest driver of global warming, accounting for roughly 30 percent of the temperature increase from preindustrial levels. Curbing emissions of methane, therefore, will be critical to solving the net-zero equation\u2014that is, reducing GHG emissions as much as possible, and counterbalancing any remaining emissions with GHG removals\u2014and stabilizing the climate.", "The bad news is that methane emissions have risen by about 25 percent in the past 20 years. The current trajectory is far off the 2 percent annual decline that would be required to meet the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C warming objectives of the Paris Agreement.1 However, there are reasons for cautious optimism. New McKinsey research shows that five industries could reduce global annual methane emissions by 20 percent by 2030 and 46 percent by 2050\u2014enough for a significant shift toward a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway. What\u2019s more, these reductions could be achieved largely with established technologies and at a reasonable cost.", "The five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management. In each of these industries, there is a solid economic case to take abatement action. In this article, we look at methane\u2019s impact on the climate, potential ways to reduce emissions, and steps that companies can take to begin managing methane effectively.\nReducing methane emissions is essential to stopping climate change\u2014but some barriers stand in the way", "Global temperatures in 2021 are 1.1\u00b0C higher than preindustrial levels, with anthropogenic methane emissions responsible for 30 percent of that warming.2 As temperatures continue to rise, there is a danger that climate feedbacks could accelerate the warming impact of methane from sources in the Arctic, wetlands, and landfills. In the Arctic, permafrost releases methane as it thaws. On the current emissions trajectory, permafrost release alone could add an incremental 5 to 20 percent to long-term methane emissions.3", "In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world\u2019s budget to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C was 570 gigatons (or 570 billion tons) of carbon dioxide (GtCO2).4 Human activities currently emit about 41 GtCO2 a year, which suggests the budget will be exhausted by 2031. A core element of the IPCC\u2019s analysis is that pathways to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are accompanied by deep reductions in emissions of methane. This means that the more methane that gets emitted, the less \u201croom\u201d there will be in the atmosphere for other GHGs. Put another way, if methane emissions stay high, the world\u2019s carbon budget will soon be spent. The IPCC analysis assumes curtailment of methane emissions of more than 2 percent a year, reaching 37 percent below 2017 levels by 2030 and 55 percent by 2050.5 If these targets aren\u2019t met, the 1.5\u00b0C objective will effectively be beyond reach", ". On the other hand, if methane emissions can be cut quickly, there will be a sufficient carbon budget remaining for the global economy to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero in an orderly transition (Exhibit 1).", "While methane and CO2 have similar warming effects, they are contrasting in several aspects. Methane stays in the atmosphere for just a decade, compared with the centuries-long persistence of CO2, but traps many times more heat. Methane emissions are much more irregular, emitted intermittently from oil wells, cattle, landfills, and coal mines.6 Another challenge is that sources of methane emissions are highly dispersed across and within the five industries that account for the majority of methane emissions from human activities (Exhibit 2). Agriculture creates 40 to 50 percent of global methane emissions, but these emissions come from millions of farms of different sizes and farming practices around the world.", "As a result of these challenges, and despite recent technology advancements, methane emissions are notoriously difficult to track and measure. In addition, abatement solutions are rarely cut and dried. Across sectors, abatement measures vary widely in terms of cost per metric ton of methane abated, feasibility, and ease of implementation. Most measures require trade-offs, either between costs and benefits or in terms of environmental impact. Dry seeding in rice farming, for instance, will cut emissions associated with flooding but may boost emissions of nitrous oxide, another GHG. The cost of methane abatement in coal mining is four to five times higher than that of leak detection and repair (LDAR) in oil and gas, because the concentration of methane in released from coal mines is much lower.7 This creates an uneven playing field that may challenge the business case for methane abatement at individual companies.", "It is also important to note that reducing methane emissions in time to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway would require both shifts in demand for commodities and technical solutions (Exhibit 3). The need for action on multiple fronts makes it all the more important to understand the feasibility of technical solutions, which we explore below.\nIndustries could reduce methane emissions with proven technologies at a manageable cost\nDespite practical hurdles, technical abatement solutions are available now across the five industries, and many rely on existing technologies and would support companies as they progress toward their net-zero targets. Moreover, on a 30-year timeline, our analysis shows that more than 90 percent of the potential emissions reductions associated with these solutions could be achieved at a cost of less than $25 per ton of carbon-dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)\u2014a price sometimes paid in the voluntary carbon markets (Exhibit 4).", "Full deployment of the abatement measures described here would cost an estimated $60 billion to $110 billion annually up to 2030, $150 billion to $220 billion annually by 2040, and $230 billion to $340 billion annually by 2050. These estimates include capital investments, operational costs and savings, as well as potential revenues from recovered methane. Cumulatively, the cost of adopting all technical levers would amount to $3.3 trillion to $5.1 trillion over a 30-year period (Exhibit 5).\nOn 2030 and 2050 horizons, estimated emissions reductions by industry are as follows:\nAgriculture", "The agriculture sector, which emits an estimated 40 to 50 percent of anthropogenic methane, could achieve a 12 percent reduction in these emissions by 2030 and a 30 percent reduction by 2050. Agricultural emissions are primarily the result of ruminant animals (principally cows and sheep), farming practices, and rice production. Ruminants create methane during digestion, along with CO2 and other gasses. The impact is significant: ruminants account for almost 70 percent of agricultural emissions. They are responsible globally for more carbon-dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions than every country except China.8 Elsewhere in agriculture, biomass burning is a moderate source of emissions, driven by the expansion of land for pasture and crops, while rice farming produces methane via mechanical flooding, which is used in many countries to manage pests. A large proportion of the emissions from agriculture could be addressed with existing technologies", ". Several companies are already commercializing feed additives for cattle, for example, while alternative approaches to water, soil carbon, nitrogen, and land management provide proven options to rice and crop farmers.", "Oil and gas\nOil and gas accounts for an estimated 20 to 25 percent of anthropogenic methane. Our analysis suggests that the sector could achieve a 40 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 73 percent reduction by 2050. The oil and gas industry emits \u201cfugitive methane\u201d through venting, leaks, and incomplete combustion during flaring. Since methane is the primary constituent of natural gas, these emissions are an untapped source of value, contingent on the necessary infrastructure being put in place. Moreover, there are numerous options to prevent losses in upstream production, including LDAR, equipment electrification or replacement, instrument air systems, and vapor-recovery units.\nCoal mining", "Coal mining produces an estimated 10 to 15 percent of anthropogenic methane. According to our analysis, the sector has the potential to achieve a 2 percent reduction in its methane emissions by 2030 and a 13 percent reduction by 2050. The vast majority of coal-mine-methane (CMM) emissions emanate from either working or abandoned deep mines. There is a significant challenge in measuring and recovering these emissions. However, established technologies can capture CMM and use it to generate power. The investment case is probably strongest for companies in China, which account for about 70 percent of CMM emissions and which have invested in coal gasification for the industrial sector.\nSolid waste", "Accounting for an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane, the solid-waste sector could achieve a 39 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 91 percent reduction by 2050. The majority of methane emissions from waste originates in landfills and open dumps, where anaerobic organic material generates methane over time. Through biogas markets and other incentives, authorities could capture these emissions and either sell the methane as renewable natural gas or use it in the production of fertilizer. However, revenues may not be sufficient to offset the costs.\nWastewater", "The wastewater sector now emits an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane. These emissions could be reduced 27 percent by 2030 and 77 percent by 2050. Wastewater emits methane from the breakdown of organic material in wastewater streams. The primary method of reducing emissions would be to build out modern sanitation infrastructure and technology. However, capital costs and policy requirements would be a significant burden in many countries. Where there is funding and access to technology, alternative abatement approaches could include the use of covered lagoons or the application of microalgae to prevent gas formation. Biosolids responsible for producing methane could be collected and sold as fertilizer or bioenergy.\nCompanies can take three no-regrets actions to begin reducing methane emissions\nTo begin reducing methane emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, some essential groundwork is required, comprising three no-regret actions:", "- Expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. First, there must be a concerted effort to expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. To get there, governments and industries would need to upgrade data collection, moving from estimates to observed measurements. Satellite, drone, and sensor monitoring, the costs of which are falling sharply, would be one way to help achieve this. Currently, methane emissions are reported in tandem with CO2 emissions. That needs to change, with methane described under its own methodology. Better measurement would offer the potential to create incentives for rapid methane reduction across industries. It could also support efforts to develop global tradable goods markets that value the carbon intensity of products along a traceable value chain.", "- Support sustainable consumption. Stakeholders could develop mechanisms to differentiate assets and score products based on their methane footprints. If every kilogram of rice, million British thermal units (MMBtu) of natural gas, ton of steel, pound of meat, barrel of oil, and ton of coal came with a methane-intensity label, the market signals could support a more orderly decarbonization transition. With this, retailers and consumers could make more informed purchasing decisions, producers could define new foundations for competitive advantage, and investors could better understand portfolio risk.", "- Increase innovation. Many solutions are sufficiently developed to be effective but are not adopted at scale because of excessive costs or a lack of awareness of available technology. In the oil and gas industry, innovation in methane monitoring\u2014for example, leveraging flyovers and on-ground detection\u2014could help businesses pinpoint leaks and cut mitigation costs. The beef industry is in the early stages of adopting feed additives, genetic breeding, and methane capture. These technologies would benefit from support to move more speedily from lab to field.", "The insights here demonstrate that abating methane emissions will be critical to achieving a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway and avoiding the worst effects of climate change. The good news is that there are many practical solutions available. Feed additives for cattle, new rice-farming techniques, advanced approaches to oil and gas leak detection, coal methane capture, and modern water and waste facilities can all be effective. Still, these solutions face implementation challenges.", "The priority, therefore, is for action where it is practical. Many of the solutions can be implemented at a relatively low or net-negative cost, and these should be a priority. Where costs are prohibitive, there is a need for coordinated action to create the infrastructure and fiscal conditions that would support further action. Across the board, there is a need for more monitoring, reporting, and verification, more support for consumer choices, and more dedication to funding technical solutions. Without these efforts, it is likely that current initiatives will fail and the planet will continue on its collision course with an uncertain and dangerous future."], "title": "Curbing methane emissions: How five industries can counter a major ..."}, {"url": "https://www.iea.org/news/addressing-barriers-hindering-progress-on-low-emissions-energy-technologies-is-key-to-meeting-climate-goals", "description": "These include recognising the IEA\u2019s technical and analytical expertise; identifying practical actions that industry, government and international organisations can take to drive down the cost of low emission technologies; agreeing on the need to address regulatory, financial and supply chain barriers to deployment; and requesting that the IEA ...", "snippets": ["The 2022 IEA Ministerial Meeting is taking place in Paris on 23 and 24 March under the theme of accelerating global action on clean energy and energy security.

But most of the observational error is expected to be contributed by the satellite retrieval (Wecht et al., 2014), and it appears that this error component is also correlated between individual retrievals.", "Figure 8 shows the hotspot grid cells in our posterior estimate, defined by emissions greater than 2.0 t h\u22121 averaged over the year (18 Gg a\u22121). Turkmenistan, Algeria, and Oman have a large number of hotspot grid cells, and for these countries we also estimate exceedingly high national emissions from oil\u2013gas activity (Table 2). The hotspots identified in our inversion have the same general geographical distribution as the ultra-emitting facilities (>25 t h\u22121) previously identified by Lauvaux et al. (2022) from single-pass TROPOMI observations, as shown in Fig. 8, though the precise locations are often at odds. The Lauvaux et al. (2022) threshold for ultra-emitters is much higher than our threshold for hotspot grid cells because theirs is based on single-pass detection of emissions that may be single or intermittent events, whereas ours is based on annual mean emissions.

We find upward corrections in other major oil-producing countries, mainly in Oman (+1.4 Tg a\u22121) and Turkmenistan (+1.0 Tg a\u22121), likely due to the large number of super-emitting point sources not accounted for in the UNFCCC estimates (Varon et al., 2019, 2021; Guanter et al., 2021; Lauvaux et al., 2022a, b; Ikakulis-Loixalte et al., 2022; Ehret et al., 2022).", "Figure 11 further illustrates the unsuitability of predicting methane emissions from oil and gas production rates by showing the ranked production rates from the top producing countries along with the corresponding posterior methane emissions. There is no significant relationship between the two. The largest emitters are not the largest producers. Recent studies in the US suggested that the number of wells and the drilling of new wells may be a better predictor of methane emission than production rates (Allen et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Varon et al., 2022). We examined the correlation with well counts for the Middle East and North Africa by using the Enverus-based Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping (OGIM_v1; Omara et al., 2023) database, recognizing that the data are incomplete particularly for new wells which could be the largest emitters (Allen et al., 2022) and also possibly for marginal wells (Omara et al., 2022)", ". A lack of infrastructure in Algeria to transport and process gas (Ouki, 2019) from remote production fields challenges the country's gas takeaway capacity, as illustrated by the exceedingly high volume of flared gas (Fig. 12) derived from flare radiances detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument (Elvidge et al., 2016). Studies in the US (Deighton et al., 2020; Omara et al., 2016, 2022) also found that equipment negligence and disrepair are the primary drivers of methane emissions for low-production wells. The impact of these stochastic processes (equipment maintenance, local management practices) on emissions is however difficult to quantify and might vary largely from basin to basin and from country to country.

For example, emissions and production in 2019 are high in both Iraq and Iran, with the difference that gas is taken to market in Iran but vented/flared in Iraq, as indicated by the much higher ratio of VIIRS flared-gas volume to gas production in Iraq (Fig. 12). This explains the higher methane intensity of Iraq compared to 0.61 % for Iran. Moreover, although Iraq has a smaller gas emission factor than Turkmenistan (Fig. 10), its much larger ratio between oil emissions and gas production to market compensates and contributes to a higher methane intensity, pinpointing inadequate operations in Iraq's oil production. The ratio of flared gas to production in Turkmenistan is even smaller than in Iran, but the methane intensity of Turkmenistan is much higher.

The majority of Qatar's gas is produced in \u223c200 wells in the offshore North Field and processed in 14 compressor trains and 2 condensate refineries in Ras Laffan Industrial City (Qatargas, 2022). This finding suggests that infrastructure developments on improving associated gas capture, modernizing equipment, and improving management practices are effective avenues to reducing the methane intensities and achieving the OGCI (2021) target of 0.2 % methane intensity. Decreasing the methane intensities in all countries in the Middle East and North Africa to 0.2 % would reduce total oil\u2013gas upstream emissions in the region to 1.1 Tg a\u22121 and represent a 26 % reduction in total anthropogenic emissions in the region (Table 1).

Again, this is likely due to super-emitting point sources not included in the reports. We further analyze gas emission by subsector including upstream or production (leaks, venting, inefficient flaring), midstream (transmission and storage), and downstream (distribution), using gridded subsectoral information from GFEIv2, and Table 3 shows results for the top emitting countries, where the subsectoral emissions from individual grid cells are summed following the procedure of Sect. 2.6.

(2022), but our larger estimate of livestock and waste offsets gas and yields good agreement on the total national emission. We find a low error correlation (<0.2) between posterior gas and waste emissions in Algeria, implying that TROPOMI can effectively separate these two sectors. Both studies show much higher gas emissions than the prior estimate, reflecting point sources that are not accounted for in the UNFCCC-based inventory. Varon et al.

They generally involve an inverse analysis in which an atmospheric transport model is used to relate emissions to atmospheric concentrations, equipped with prior information from a spatially resolved emission inventory. Comparing the predicted atmospheric concentrations from the prior emission inventory to the observations enables correction of the inventory by Bayesian synthesis (Brasseur and Jacob, 2017). Satellite observations in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) are particularly attractive for top-down analyses due to their global coverage and sensitivity down to the surface (Jacob et al., 2016, 2022).

Results are shown in Fig. 4 with a comparison to the central limit theorem. We see that the decrease in the observational error variance with the number P of individual retrievals going into a super-observation is much weaker than would be expected for uncorrelated errors.

According to the Methane Mitigation Technologies Platform, some of the key methane emission sources in the industry include leakages from oil and gas wells, storage tanks, and compressors. To reduce these emissions, technologies such as vapor recovery units, low-bleed pneumatics, and leak detection and repair programs can be implemented. However, the cost and effectiveness of these technologies vary depending on the specific source and situation.\n\nFor example, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that implementing leak detection and repair programs on well sites can reduce methane emissions by 75-85%, with an estimated cost of $1,200-$3,000 per well. On the other hand, investing in a vapor recovery unit for storage tanks can result in a 95% reduction in methane emissions, but can cost up to $150,000 per tank. Therefore, it is important for companies to assess their specific emission sources and goals to determine the most cost-effective technology for their operations.\n\nIn terms of the benefits of reducing methane emissions, a report by the International Energy Agency estimated that implementing cost-effective methane mitigation measures could save the industry $50 billion by 2025. Additionally, reducing methane emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential over 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\n\nHowever, there are barriers to implementing these technologies, particularly in countries with high methane emissions such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. These barriers can include a lack of infrastructure and resources, as well as regulatory challenges. This is where international support and policy incentives or penalties can play a role in promoting and incentivizing methane reduction efforts.\n\nFurthermore, the costs of digital transformation in the oil and gas industry, including the adoption of new technologies for methane reduction, are significant. A report by Gartner predicts global IT spending in the industry to reach $4.5 trillion in 2024.

Despite the urgency to address these pollutants, however, methane emissions continue to rise globally, with 2020 seeing the highest atmospheric concentration of methane ever. Recent reports, such as the Global Methane Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report, also underscore the need for fast action to reduce methane.", "The good news is that acting on methane comes with tremendous benefits, helping to limit near-term temperature rise and improve air quality, leading to better public health outcomes and improved food security. These actions can often be implemented at zero or low cost, providing significant economic benefits for governments and companies. In fact, in several cases, the actions reap cost savings after the initial investments are paid off. Many of the mitigation measures are also readily-available across all major methane emitting sectors \u2014 energy, agriculture and waste \u2014 providing an excellent solution for governments to meet climate and development goals.\nWhy is Reducing Methane Emissions Important?", "Methane is the second most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG), and is 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years in the atmosphere (34 times more powerful over 100 years). Because it exists for a relatively short time in the atmosphere, cutting methane provides a quick benefit in terms of limiting near-term temperature rise. Studies estimate that ambitious actions to reduce methane can avoid 0.3 degrees C of warming by 2050.\nReducing methane also helps to improve air quality, as it is a pre-cursor to ground-level ozone, a damaging air pollutant that harms human health and crop yields. Readily-available methane mitigation measures can also prevent more than 250,000 premature deaths and 26 million tons of crop losses annually.\nHow Can Methane Emissions be Reduced?", "Twelve countries are responsible for around two-thirds of global methane emissions: China, Russia, India, the United States, Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Mexico, Australia and Nigeria.\nMost human-caused methane emissions stem from three sectors \u2014 energy (35%), agriculture (40%) and waste (20%) \u2014 so a focus on action in these sectors can help to stave off immediate warming impacts.\nEnergy\nThe energy sector is responsible for more than a third of global methane emissions, with oil and gas contributing the lion\u2019s share (around 14%). Methane emissions occur along the entire oil and gas supply chain, but especially from fugitive emissions from leaking equipment, system upsets, and deliberate flaring and venting.\nExisting cost-effective solutions can help reduce emissions, including initiating leak detection and repair programs, implementing better technologies and operating practices, and capturing and utilizing methane that would otherwise be wasted.", "The International Energy Agency estimates around 75% of total oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided using currently available technologies, with more than half of these reductions at zero net cost. But despite the clear economic case for sealing leaks, utilities often recoup the costs of leaked gas by passing them on to consumers. Voluntary coalitions are, however, coming together to work toward lowering methane emissions in the sector, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.\nFood Systems\nAgriculture is the largest contributor to global methane emissions, producing about 40% of these emissions, primarily from enteric fermentation (cow burps), rice cultivation and manure management.", "Improved agricultural production practices \u2014 specifically focused on improving efficiency \u2014 can enhance livestock and crop yields, provide more income for farmers, while at the same time reduce methane emissions per unit output. In areas where emission reductions are more difficult to achieve, like enteric fermentation, groups such as the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate and the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases are helping spur greater innovation and technology deployment.\nReducing food loss and waste is another important area. Roughly one third of all food produced is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain, with agricultural production responsible for the greatest amount, exacerbating food insecurity in vulnerable nations. These losses are due to many factors, including spillage or degradation during production.", "If counted as a country, food loss and waste would be the third largest source of GHG emissions after China and the United States. But food producers and consumers can take immediate steps to reduce food waste immediately \u2014 from improving inventory systems, changing food date labelling practices and better facilitating the sale or donation of perishable products.\nSmall shifts in diet choices, particularly away from beef, can also make an impact globally, both in terms of freeing up agricultural land and reducing methane emissions. However, meeting today\u2019s announced pledge does not necessarily depend on these diet shifts, according to data in the Global Methane Assessment.\nMunicipal Solid Waste", "The waste sector accounts for around 20% of global human-caused methane emissions. Luckily, cost-effective mitigation solutions do exist, with the greatest potential related to separating organics and recycling which can also create new jobs. Upstream avoidance of food loss and waste is also key.\nAdditionally, capturing landfill gas and generating energy will reduce methane emissions, displace other forms of fuels and create new streams of revenue. The EPA projects that landfill gas utilization will remain the cheapest solution to mitigate emissions in the waste sector, often implemented at zero net cost. However, projects require high upfront capital costs which can sometimes be a deterrent in poorer jurisdictions.\nWhich Countries are Already Committed to Reduce Methane?", "Outside of the newly announced global pledge, several countries have taken on individual commitments to tackle methane. In the last two years, for example, Nigeria and Cote D\u2019Ivoire have committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 45% by 2025 and 60-75% by 2030. The European Union has adopted an economy-wide methane strategy, with its accompanying models indicating that the region will need to limit methane emissions by 35-37% by 2030 relative to 2005 to meet its overall climate commitment. New Zealand aims to reduce biogenic methane emissions by 10% by 2030, and 24-47% by 2050, both relative to 2017 levels.\nWhat to Look Out for Next?", "The announcement of a global pledge to reduce methane emissions represents an important step forward \u2014 the first time that countries will collectively commit to acting to address methane across all sectors of their economies. At the same time, several countries are also finalizing their updated national climate action plans (the nationally determined contributions), where ambitious commitments to address methane should also be included \u2014 helping to keep the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals within reach and ensure a safer future for all."], "title": "5 Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Global Methane Emissions | World ..."}, {"url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/curbing-methane-emissions-how-five-industries-can-counter-a-major-climate-threat", "description": "New McKinsey research shows that five industries could reduce global annual methane emissions by 20 percent by 2030 and 46 percent by 2050\u2014enough for a significant shift toward a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway.

Curbing emissions of methane, therefore, will be critical to solving the net-zero equation\u2014that is, reducing GHG emissions as much as possible, and counterbalancing any remaining emissions with GHG removals\u2014and stabilizing the climate.", "The bad news is that methane emissions have risen by about 25 percent in the past 20 years. The current trajectory is far off the 2 percent annual decline that would be required to meet the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C warming objectives of the Paris Agreement.1 However, there are reasons for cautious optimism.

What\u2019s more, these reductions could be achieved largely with established technologies and at a reasonable cost.", "The five industries, which together account for 98 percent of humanity\u2019s methane emissions, are agriculture, oil and gas, coal mining, solid-waste management, and wastewater management. In each of these industries, there is a solid economic case to take abatement action. In this article, we look at methane\u2019s impact on the climate, potential ways to reduce emissions, and steps that companies can take to begin managing methane effectively.\nReducing methane emissions is essential to stopping climate change\u2014but some barriers stand in the way", "Global temperatures in 2021 are 1.1\u00b0C higher than preindustrial levels, with anthropogenic methane emissions responsible for 30 percent of that warming.2 As temperatures continue to rise, there is a danger that climate feedbacks could accelerate the warming impact of methane from sources in the Arctic, wetlands, and landfills. In the Arctic, permafrost releases methane as it thaws. On the current emissions trajectory, permafrost release alone could add an incremental 5 to 20 percent to long-term methane emissions.3", "In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world\u2019s budget to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C was 570 gigatons (or 570 billion tons) of carbon dioxide (GtCO2).4 Human activities currently emit about 41 GtCO2 a year, which suggests the budget will be exhausted by 2031. A core element of the IPCC\u2019s analysis is that pathways to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are accompanied by deep reductions in emissions of methane. This means that the more methane that gets emitted, the less \u201croom\u201d there will be in the atmosphere for other GHGs. Put another way, if methane emissions stay high, the world\u2019s carbon budget will soon be spent. The IPCC analysis assumes curtailment of methane emissions of more than 2 percent a year, reaching 37 percent below 2017 levels by 2030 and 55 percent by 2050.5 If these targets aren\u2019t met, the 1.5\u00b0C objective will effectively be beyond reach", ". On the other hand, if methane emissions can be cut quickly, there will be a sufficient carbon budget remaining for the global economy to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero in an orderly transition (Exhibit 1).", "While methane and CO2 have similar warming effects, they are contrasting in several aspects. Methane stays in the atmosphere for just a decade, compared with the centuries-long persistence of CO2, but traps many times more heat. Methane emissions are much more irregular, emitted intermittently from oil wells, cattle, landfills, and coal mines.6 Another challenge is that sources of methane emissions are highly dispersed across and within the five industries that account for the majority of methane emissions from human activities (Exhibit 2). Agriculture creates 40 to 50 percent of global methane emissions, but these emissions come from millions of farms of different sizes and farming practices around the world.", "As a result of these challenges, and despite recent technology advancements, methane emissions are notoriously difficult to track and measure. In addition, abatement solutions are rarely cut and dried. Across sectors, abatement measures vary widely in terms of cost per metric ton of methane abated, feasibility, and ease of implementation. Most measures require trade-offs, either between costs and benefits or in terms of environmental impact. Dry seeding in rice farming, for instance, will cut emissions associated with flooding but may boost emissions of nitrous oxide, another GHG. The cost of methane abatement in coal mining is four to five times higher than that of leak detection and repair (LDAR) in oil and gas, because the concentration of methane in released from coal mines is much lower.7 This creates an uneven playing field that may challenge the business case for methane abatement at individual companies.", "It is also important to note that reducing methane emissions in time to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway would require both shifts in demand for commodities and technical solutions (Exhibit 3). The need for action on multiple fronts makes it all the more important to understand the feasibility of technical solutions, which we explore below.\nIndustries could reduce methane emissions with proven technologies at a manageable cost\nDespite practical hurdles, technical abatement solutions are available now across the five industries, and many rely on existing technologies and would support companies as they progress toward their net-zero targets. Moreover, on a 30-year timeline, our analysis shows that more than 90 percent of the potential emissions reductions associated with these solutions could be achieved at a cost of less than $25 per ton of carbon-dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)\u2014a price sometimes paid in the voluntary carbon markets (Exhibit 4).", "Full deployment of the abatement measures described here would cost an estimated $60 billion to $110 billion annually up to 2030, $150 billion to $220 billion annually by 2040, and $230 billion to $340 billion annually by 2050. These estimates include capital investments, operational costs and savings, as well as potential revenues from recovered methane. Cumulatively, the cost of adopting all technical levers would amount to $3.3 trillion to $5.1 trillion over a 30-year period (Exhibit 5).\nOn 2030 and 2050 horizons, estimated emissions reductions by industry are as follows:\nAgriculture", "The agriculture sector, which emits an estimated 40 to 50 percent of anthropogenic methane, could achieve a 12 percent reduction in these emissions by 2030 and a 30 percent reduction by 2050. Agricultural emissions are primarily the result of ruminant animals (principally cows and sheep), farming practices, and rice production. Ruminants create methane during digestion, along with CO2 and other gasses. The impact is significant: ruminants account for almost 70 percent of agricultural emissions. They are responsible globally for more carbon-dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions than every country except China.8 Elsewhere in agriculture, biomass burning is a moderate source of emissions, driven by the expansion of land for pasture and crops, while rice farming produces methane via mechanical flooding, which is used in many countries to manage pests. A large proportion of the emissions from agriculture could be addressed with existing technologies", ". Several companies are already commercializing feed additives for cattle, for example, while alternative approaches to water, soil carbon, nitrogen, and land management provide proven options to rice and crop farmers.", "Oil and gas\nOil and gas accounts for an estimated 20 to 25 percent of anthropogenic methane. Our analysis suggests that the sector could achieve a 40 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 73 percent reduction by 2050. The oil and gas industry emits \u201cfugitive methane\u201d through venting, leaks, and incomplete combustion during flaring. Since methane is the primary constituent of natural gas, these emissions are an untapped source of value, contingent on the necessary infrastructure being put in place. Moreover, there are numerous options to prevent losses in upstream production, including LDAR, equipment electrification or replacement, instrument air systems, and vapor-recovery units.\nCoal mining", "Coal mining produces an estimated 10 to 15 percent of anthropogenic methane. According to our analysis, the sector has the potential to achieve a 2 percent reduction in its methane emissions by 2030 and a 13 percent reduction by 2050. The vast majority of coal-mine-methane (CMM) emissions emanate from either working or abandoned deep mines. There is a significant challenge in measuring and recovering these emissions. However, established technologies can capture CMM and use it to generate power. The investment case is probably strongest for companies in China, which account for about 70 percent of CMM emissions and which have invested in coal gasification for the industrial sector.\nSolid waste", "Accounting for an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane, the solid-waste sector could achieve a 39 percent reduction in sectoral emissions by 2030 and a 91 percent reduction by 2050. The majority of methane emissions from waste originates in landfills and open dumps, where anaerobic organic material generates methane over time. Through biogas markets and other incentives, authorities could capture these emissions and either sell the methane as renewable natural gas or use it in the production of fertilizer. However, revenues may not be sufficient to offset the costs.\nWastewater", "The wastewater sector now emits an estimated 7 to 10 percent of anthropogenic methane. These emissions could be reduced 27 percent by 2030 and 77 percent by 2050. Wastewater emits methane from the breakdown of organic material in wastewater streams. The primary method of reducing emissions would be to build out modern sanitation infrastructure and technology. However, capital costs and policy requirements would be a significant burden in many countries. Where there is funding and access to technology, alternative abatement approaches could include the use of covered lagoons or the application of microalgae to prevent gas formation. Biosolids responsible for producing methane could be collected and sold as fertilizer or bioenergy.\nCompanies can take three no-regrets actions to begin reducing methane emissions\nTo begin reducing methane emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, some essential groundwork is required, comprising three no-regret actions:", "- Expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. First, there must be a concerted effort to expand monitoring, reporting, and verification. To get there, governments and industries would need to upgrade data collection, moving from estimates to observed measurements. Satellite, drone, and sensor monitoring, the costs of which are falling sharply, would be one way to help achieve this. Currently, methane emissions are reported in tandem with CO2 emissions. That needs to change, with methane described under its own methodology. Better measurement would offer the potential to create incentives for rapid methane reduction across industries. It could also support efforts to develop global tradable goods markets that value the carbon intensity of products along a traceable value chain.", "- Support sustainable consumption. Stakeholders could develop mechanisms to differentiate assets and score products based on their methane footprints. If every kilogram of rice, million British thermal units (MMBtu) of natural gas, ton of steel, pound of meat, barrel of oil, and ton of coal came with a methane-intensity label, the market signals could support a more orderly decarbonization transition. With this, retailers and consumers could make more informed purchasing decisions, producers could define new foundations for competitive advantage, and investors could better understand portfolio risk.", "- Increase innovation. Many solutions are sufficiently developed to be effective but are not adopted at scale because of excessive costs or a lack of awareness of available technology. In the oil and gas industry, innovation in methane monitoring\u2014for example, leveraging flyovers and on-ground detection\u2014could help businesses pinpoint leaks and cut mitigation costs. The beef industry is in the early stages of adopting feed additives, genetic breeding, and methane capture.

This indicates that these countries have a significant impact on global methane levels and their efforts to reduce methane emissions would greatly contribute to climate change mitigation. The report also highlights that these countries can benefit economically from improving their methane management practices, by using captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports and reduced domestic energy costs.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the excessive methane emissions in these countries is the lack of proper infrastructural and technological capabilities to manage methane. A study published in Nature Communications analyzed satellite observations and found that the actual methane releases from global oil and gas operations are 30% higher than what is estimated by these countries in their reports to the United Nations. This discrepancy is mainly due to the use of emissions factors, which are often lower than the actual amount of methane being released.\n\nAside from economic benefits, there is also the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. This is especially important as the United States and the European Union have recently announced a pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. This pledge sets the minimum requirement for countries to curb this dangerous climate pollutant, highlighting the importance of reducing methane emissions.\n\nIn order to address this issue, there is a need for international support and policy incentives or penalties.

Despite the urgency to address these pollutants, however, methane emissions continue to rise globally, with 2020 seeing the highest atmospheric concentration of methane ever. Recent reports, such as the Global Methane Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report, also underscore the need for fast action to reduce methane.", "The good news is that acting on methane comes with tremendous benefits, helping to limit near-term temperature rise and improve air quality, leading to better public health outcomes and improved food security. These actions can often be implemented at zero or low cost, providing significant economic benefits for governments and companies. In fact, in several cases, the actions reap cost savings after the initial investments are paid off. Many of the mitigation measures are also readily-available across all major methane emitting sectors \u2014 energy, agriculture and waste \u2014 providing an excellent solution for governments to meet climate and development goals.\nWhy is Reducing Methane Emissions Important?", "Methane is the second most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG), and is 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years in the atmosphere (34 times more powerful over 100 years). Because it exists for a relatively short time in the atmosphere, cutting methane provides a quick benefit in terms of limiting near-term temperature rise. Studies estimate that ambitious actions to reduce methane can avoid 0.3 degrees C of warming by 2050.\nReducing methane also helps to improve air quality, as it is a pre-cursor to ground-level ozone, a damaging air pollutant that harms human health and crop yields. Readily-available methane mitigation measures can also prevent more than 250,000 premature deaths and 26 million tons of crop losses annually.\nHow Can Methane Emissions be Reduced?", "Twelve countries are responsible for around two-thirds of global methane emissions: China, Russia, India, the United States, Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Mexico, Australia and Nigeria.\nMost human-caused methane emissions stem from three sectors \u2014 energy (35%), agriculture (40%) and waste (20%) \u2014 so a focus on action in these sectors can help to stave off immediate warming impacts.\nEnergy\nThe energy sector is responsible for more than a third of global methane emissions, with oil and gas contributing the lion\u2019s share (around 14%). Methane emissions occur along the entire oil and gas supply chain, but especially from fugitive emissions from leaking equipment, system upsets, and deliberate flaring and venting.\nExisting cost-effective solutions can help reduce emissions, including initiating leak detection and repair programs, implementing better technologies and operating practices, and capturing and utilizing methane that would otherwise be wasted.", "The International Energy Agency estimates around 75% of total oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided using currently available technologies, with more than half of these reductions at zero net cost. But despite the clear economic case for sealing leaks, utilities often recoup the costs of leaked gas by passing them on to consumers. Voluntary coalitions are, however, coming together to work toward lowering methane emissions in the sector, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.\nFood Systems\nAgriculture is the largest contributor to global methane emissions, producing about 40% of these emissions, primarily from enteric fermentation (cow burps), rice cultivation and manure management.", "Improved agricultural production practices \u2014 specifically focused on improving efficiency \u2014 can enhance livestock and crop yields, provide more income for farmers, while at the same time reduce methane emissions per unit output. In areas where emission reductions are more difficult to achieve, like enteric fermentation, groups such as the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate and the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases are helping spur greater innovation and technology deployment.\nReducing food loss and waste is another important area. Roughly one third of all food produced is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain, with agricultural production responsible for the greatest amount, exacerbating food insecurity in vulnerable nations. These losses are due to many factors, including spillage or degradation during production.", "If counted as a country, food loss and waste would be the third largest source of GHG emissions after China and the United States. But food producers and consumers can take immediate steps to reduce food waste immediately \u2014 from improving inventory systems, changing food date labelling practices and better facilitating the sale or donation of perishable products.\nSmall shifts in diet choices, particularly away from beef, can also make an impact globally, both in terms of freeing up agricultural land and reducing methane emissions. However, meeting today\u2019s announced pledge does not necessarily depend on these diet shifts, according to data in the Global Methane Assessment.\nMunicipal Solid Waste", "The waste sector accounts for around 20% of global human-caused methane emissions. Luckily, cost-effective mitigation solutions do exist, with the greatest potential related to separating organics and recycling which can also create new jobs. Upstream avoidance of food loss and waste is also key.\nAdditionally, capturing landfill gas and generating energy will reduce methane emissions, displace other forms of fuels and create new streams of revenue. The EPA projects that landfill gas utilization will remain the cheapest solution to mitigate emissions in the waste sector, often implemented at zero net cost. However, projects require high upfront capital costs which can sometimes be a deterrent in poorer jurisdictions.\nWhich Countries are Already Committed to Reduce Methane?", "Outside of the newly announced global pledge, several countries have taken on individual commitments to tackle methane. In the last two years, for example, Nigeria and Cote D\u2019Ivoire have committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 45% by 2025 and 60-75% by 2030. The European Union has adopted an economy-wide methane strategy, with its accompanying models indicating that the region will need to limit methane emissions by 35-37% by 2030 relative to 2005 to meet its overall climate commitment. New Zealand aims to reduce biogenic methane emissions by 10% by 2030, and 24-47% by 2050, both relative to 2017 levels.\nWhat to Look Out for Next?", "The announcement of a global pledge to reduce methane emissions represents an important step forward \u2014 the first time that countries will collectively commit to acting to address methane across all sectors of their economies. At the same time, several countries are also finalizing their updated national climate action plans (the nationally determined contributions), where ambitious commitments to address methane should also be included \u2014 helping to keep the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals within reach and ensure a safer future for all."], "title": "5 Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Global Methane Emissions | World ..."}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction/methane-explained", "description": "GFMR works with developing countries to end gas flaring and methane emissions as part of their journey to a low-carbon future, and supports their efforts to avoid wasting a valuable natural resource that could help accelerate economic development and improve energy access.", "snippets": ["Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), with a global warming potential (GWP) around 28 times greater than the same mass of carbon dioxide emissions on a 100-year basis, and over 80 times more powerful on a 20-year basis. This makes methane second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.\nWhile methane has a significantly higher GWP than carbon dioxide, it also has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, and so after about 12 years, the methane in the atmosphere breaks down into GHGs with a lower GWP. In contrast, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for over a century.\nAs a result, the rapid reduction of methane emissions is:\none of the most effective ways to quickly slow the rate of climate change,\ncritical to global efforts to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels; and\nprobably the single most important climate action we can undertake in the short-term.", "How does oil and gas production contribute to methane emissions?\nThe global energy sector accounted for approximately 40% of global anthropogenic methane emissions in 2021, with the oil and gas industry representing over 60% of the emissions from the energy sector, and industry estimates suggest that methane emissions from fossil fuels have been increasing in recent years.\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant source of methane emissions globally. In fact, methane emissions from venting, leakage, and flaring in the oil and gas sector are currently estimated to be responsible for roughly 25% of global anthropogenic methane emissions. Oil and gas operations release methane into the atmosphere through the wasteful practices of intentional flaring and venting, as well as through the unintentional release of fugitive methane emissions.\nMethane from fugitive emissions", "During the production and transportation of natural gas (associated or non-associated gas), leaks and unintentional releases result in methane escaping into the atmosphere. While gas composition varies, natural gas typically comprises about 80-95 percent methane, with the remaining comprising heavier hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, and butane.\nIn recent years the scale of these fugitive emissions has become apparent, with advances in methane detection technology allowing previously undetected leaks to be identified. These leaks, typically resulting from poor maintenance and broken equipment, can release enormous amounts of methane and are often labeled \u201csuper-emitters.\u201d\nMethane from flaring\nFlares are a direct source of methane emissions, as flares do not completely combust all the hydrocarbons in the gas stream, but by how much is not well understood.\nTypically, greenhouse gas (GHG) estimates of gas flaring emissions are based on two core assumptions:", "that flares have a methane destruction efficiency of 98%, resulting in 2% of the methane in the flare gas stream being emitted to the atmosphere un-combusted; and\nthat flares are lit and operating properly 100% of the time.\nThese assumptions, used widely for decades across the oil and gas industry, have formed the foundation of estimates of GHG emissions from flaring, and using them we estimate that in 2023 flaring resulted in 381 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions (MMtCO2e), of which 336 MMtCO2e was in the form of carbon dioxide and 45 MMtCO2e was in the form of uncombusted methane.\nHowever, until recently, neither of these assumptions had been rigorously tested in real-world operational environments. GFMR has developed an interactive toolkit to help demonstrate the likely GHG emissions from flaring across a range of circumstances.", "The 98% value for flare destruction efficiency is attributed to controlled studies conducted on behalf of the United States EPA as far back as the 1980s. To date, flare destruction efficiency has not been widely field-tested because direct measurement in realworld environments is highly complex and problematic. However, given its importance in understanding the methane emissions associated with flaring, it has become a critical area of research.\nIn 2022, a paper was published in Science detailing the findings of a field campaign in the United States to measure flare destruction efficiency. The study found an average destruction efficiency of 95.2% facilities in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken basins, considerably lower than the default 98% commonly used.\nMethane from venting", "Venting sometimes occurs as a result of faulty flaring equipment and unlit flares. However, in the absence of flaring equipment or the infrastructure to bring the gas to market, some operators choose to deliberately and routinely vent gas. Given the high methane content of associated gas and methane\u2019s high GWP, venting is a particularly polluting industry practice that can be easily and cost-effectively addressed with existing technologies.\nIn another study, researchers found that 3.2% of the flares assessed in the Bakken were operating unlit, i.e., directly venting gas, including methane, to the atmosphere. Using these findings and building on an earlier study in the Permian that found that 5% of the flare assessed were unlit, the study estimates an average of 4.1% of flares may typically be unlit across all three basins.", "Bringing together the measured destruction efficiency of 95.2% and the prevalence of unlit flares, the researchers suggest that flares in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken actually operate with an \u2018effective\u2019 destruction efficiency of 91.1%. If these findings are widespread across the US, let alone world, the true scale of the contribution of gas flaring to methane emissions could be hugely underestimated.\nWhile oil and gas operations are a significant source of methane and carbon dioxide emissions globally, the industry is also well placed to quickly respond to and address emissions through flaring and venting reduction and tackling fugitive methane emissions.\nHow can we reduce the amount of methane emitted?", "Taking quick and decisive action on methane from oil and gas operations could avoid as much as 0.1 degrees C of warming by mid-century\u2014equivalent to zeroing out the emissions of every car and truck in the world. Cutting methane emissions is low-hanging fruit in tackling climate change. It is vital to aligning the global energy sector with a global 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory.\nTackling fugitive methane emissions and unlit flares (venting) requires the development of new technologies capable of not only detecting methane but of accurately measuring these emissions. The accuracy of detection and measurement technologies has increased dramatically over the last few years. Still, effective leak detection and repair (LDAR) often requires using several complementary approaches, from satellites and aerial surveillance down to on-the-ground teams operating handheld devices.", "In addition, flare elimination efforts also support methane reductions from other sources, such as venting and fugitive releases. Without an outlet to export or utilize the gas, any methane conserved from these sources will ultimately be sent to flare, and while there may be an overall emissions reduction, methane is still released, and this energy source is still wasted. This highlights the importance of flare reduction and gas management to overall oil and gas decarbonization strategies.\nAt any given time, flares may be:\nlit and operating effectively;\nlit and operating ineffectively, with incomplete\ncombustion of methane;\nunlit and active, venting methane directly to the\natmosphere; or\nunlit and inactive, with no associated emissions.\nResearch has revealed that the destruction efficiency of a flare is likely to be a product of many factors, including flare gas composition, flow rate, flare system design, operation and maintenance and local environmental factors such as wind speed.", "While research continues, there are three critical steps operators can take now to reduce methane emissions from flaring:\nEnsure flares are always lit and have automatic systems to re-ignite if they should go out.\nEnsure flares are operating effectively and optimize flare destruction efficiency.\nReduce and ultimately eliminate the gas going to the flare, which should be the end goal.\nWhat is being done about methane emissions from oil and gas operations?\nCutting methane from oil and gas production is low-hanging fruit in tackling climate change, and critical to aligning the global energy sector with a global 1.5\u02daC warming trajectory, as agreed in the Global Methane Pledge launched at COP26.\nDespite this, methane abatement solutions are underfunded, considering their climate change mitigation potential, and low- and middle-income oil-producing countries need technical and financial support to implement methane reduction projects and policies.", "Flaring and methane reductions can be achieved with currently available technology. However, in the case of flaring, the World Bank\u2019s most recent Global Gas Flaring Tracker report shows that gas flaring continues unabated in many countries, despite available technology.\nFor the last two decades the World Bank\u2019s Global Gas Flaring reduction Partnership (GGFR) provided technical advice and support to help developing countries end routine gas flaring, which is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Launched at COP28 in December 2023, the GFMR Partnership builds on this legacy and has expanded the World Bank\u2019s efforts to decarbonize the global energy system by also helping reduce the methane emissions associated with oil and gas production.", "GFMR works with developing countries to end gas flaring and methane emissions as part of their journey to a low-carbon future, and supports their efforts to avoid wasting a valuable natural resource that could help accelerate economic development and improve energy access. By 2030, this new fund will disburse more than $250 million to support methane mitigation efforts and expects to leverage billions more in public and private sector finance.\nWe advise governments and operators on the technical solutions and regulations which will contribute to finally ending gas flaring and venting. This includes providing technical assistance, enabling policy and regulatory reform, institutional strengthening, and mobilizing financing to support action by governments and operators.", "GFMR applies clear eligibility criteria so that support to developing countries drives long term emissions reduction projects and initiatives. For example, access to project development and financing support through GFMR will be subject to a commitment to\nmeasure and report emissions through the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 framework,\nachieve near-zero absolute methane emissions by 2030 by reducing methane intensity to below 0.2%, and\nachieve zero routine flaring by 2030.\nThe World Bank and GFMR are also supporting organizations for the Methane Guiding Principles, a coalition of industry, multilateral institutions, non-governmental organizations, and academia working together to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector.\nOn effective flare operation, GFMR and partners in the Methane Guiding Principles initiative recently published a Methane Flaring Toolkit, which seeks to provide important technologies and solutions to reduce methane emissions from flaring.", "We continue to encourage all operators and governments to commit to the World Bank\u2019s Zero Routine Flaring (ZRF) initiative, which aims to end the 160-year-old industry practice. We have also published several important knowledge products to support flaring and venting reduction, including our comprehensive review of Global Flaring and Venting Regulations, Financing Solutions to Reduce Natural Gas Flaring and Methane Emissions and, in partnership with IPIECA and IOGP, the Flaring Management Guidance for the O&G Industry.\nGas flaring is the burning of the natural gas associated with oil extraction. The practice has persisted since the beginning of oil production over 160 years ago. It takes place due to a range of issues.\nFor Faith Nwadishi and her community in Nigeria, gas flaring negatively impacts their fundamental way of life. She tells us why this oil and gas industry practice must end as soon as possible. #EndRoutineFlaring", "The Methane Flaring Toolkit provides practical advice and information on the effective measurement and monitoring of methane emissions from gas flares in the oil and gas industry.\nThis guidance, developed with Ipieca and IOGP, outlines new flaring management and reduction developments, and examines industry experiences with eliminating flaring, new technologies, business models, operational improvements, and regulatory policy.\nThe World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Tracker is the only global and independent indicator of routine gas flaring. The estimates allow us to monitor global flaring levels and track progress toward our goal of Zero Routine Flaring by 2030.\nGFMR\u2019s global regulatory review provides a systematic analysis of regulatory frameworks governing the flaring and venting of gas in 21 oil-producing countries. The framework for comparing regulations described in this report will help regulators and policymakers reach the goal of Zero Routine Flaring by 2030.", "This site uses cookies to optimize functionality and give you the best possible experience.

For example, the return on investment for methane abatement projects may be longer than for other investment opportunities. There may also be a lack of awareness regarding the scale of methane emissions and the cost-effectiveness of abatement. Sometimes infrastructure or institutional arrangements are inadequate, making it difficult for companies to receive the income from avoided emissions.\nRegardless of the value of captured gas, we estimate that it would be cost-effective to deploy nearly all fossil fuel methane abatement measures if emissions are priced at about USD 20/tonne CO2\u2011equivalent. Tapping into this potential will require new regulatory frameworks, financing mechanisms and improved emissions tracking.\nDelivering the 75% cut in methane emissions requires USD 170 billion in spending to 2030", "We estimate that around USD 170 billion in spending is needed to deliver the methane abatement measures deployed by the fossil fuel industry in the NZE Scenario.

Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and sold or used. The share is higher for oil and natural gas (50%) than for coal (15%).", "Fossil fuel companies should carry the primary responsibility for financing these abatement measures, given that the amount of spending needed represents less than 5% of the income the industry generated in 2023. Nonetheless, we estimate that about USD 45 billion of spending in low- and middle-income countries requires particular attention, as sources of finance are likely to be more limited. To date, we estimate that external sources of finance targeted at reducing methane in the fossil fuel industry total less than USD 1 billion, although this should catalyse a far greater level of spending.\nNew tools to track emissions will bring a step change in transparency", "Analysis of this data reveals both signs of progress and some worrying trends. On one hand, more governments and fossil fuel companies have committed to take action on methane.

Because methane is so much more potent than carbon dioxide, the two fields emit the equivalent of more than 403 million tons (366 million metric tonnes) of carbon dioxide, or more than the annual emissions by the United Kingdom.

Emissions can also result from agriculture and livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Flaring burns unwanted gas and adds CO2 into the atmosphere, but it is an easy process to detect and has been increasingly frowned upon. Venting releases the invisible methane into the air completely unburned and has been harder to track until more recent developments in satellite technology.

Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 around 12 years compared with centuries \u2013 but absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere.\nMethane also affects air quality because it can lead to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, a dangerous pollutant.

Bottom-up approaches can use activity data (e.g., the number of facilities or the extent of operations) multiplied by standardised emission factors (e.g., default values or leak rates for particular types of equipment).

They can struggle to provide readings in many environments such as offshore areas, mountain ranges, snowy or ice-covered regions, and at high latitudes. Satellites are also impaired by cloud cover, even if only a portion of the monitored area is covered, limiting the number of days when detections can be made. For example, countries with dense forests or in equatorial regions, such as Nigeria or Venezuela, are very often cloudy, hindering observation efforts.", "Data from the European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-5P, processed by the earth analytics firm Kayrros, indicates that during 2022 there were around 70 countries where methane emissions from oil and gas operations could have been detected for at least 15 days. Large emission events were observed in 20 of these countries in 2022. Coverage tended to be best in the Middle East, parts of Central Asia and Australia, where it was possible to make a direct observation every 3-5 days. On the remaining days, cloud coverage or other interference prevented observations from taking place. Accounting for the level of satellite coverage, observed very large leaks are estimated to have emitted around 3 Mt of methane from oil and gas operations in 2022 (6% of our estimate of oil and gas emissions in the 20 countries where events were detected).", "New technology development has allowed satellites to detect methane emissions in offshore areas for the first time in 2022, but this has not yet become part of routine monitoring efforts, and there is still a high degree of uncertainty over estimates derived from satellite readings of emissions from offshore events. Emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were one of the first offshore leaks to be quantified using satellite data.

Leaks can occur at liquefaction facilities from gas service valves, reciprocating compressors, pump seals or metering equipment as well as during the transfer of LNG from the facility to the ship. During shipping, methane leaks can also occur if \u201cboil-off\u201d gas (a small fraction of the LNG cargo that evaporates) is vented or is used as propulsion and not fully combusted in the ship\u2019s engines.", "Based on detailed data on global LNG trade and the sample of satellite readings of LNG liquefaction facilities from GHGSat, we estimate total fugitive methane emissions from LNG liquefaction and shipping in 2022 to be around 0.4 Mt, equivalent to around 0.1% of total annual LNG transported globally. Shipping makes up the majority of emissions and the main route to reduce associated methane is by ensuring that boil-off gas is injected into engines or reliquefied rather than vented. Manufacturers are increasingly promoting technologies that reduce methane slip (gas that is not fully combusted in ships\u2019 engines), for example by recirculating exhaust gases, using high-pressure direct injection or methane oxidation catalysts.\nThe IEA Global Methane Tracker is our effort to provide a coherent set of estimates for the energy sector based on the best available data", "The IEA produces and publishes country-level estimates for energy-related methane emissions and abatement options as part of our IEA Global Methane Tracker.

In addition to these emissions, we include emissions from the end use of coal, oil products and natural gas in the Global Methane Tracker (3 Mt or 3% of energy-related methane). This estimate is based on the emissions factors published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for energy consumption in homes, industries and in the transport sector. Some measurement campaigns have suggested that these emissions factors could significantly underestimate actual emissions across different end-use environments, including in industry, cities and households. These are areas with very high levels of uncertainty and our estimates will continue to be updated as the evidence base grows.", "Emissions from abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells are not included in the Global Methane Tracker. Existing measurements cover a limited number of facilities and regions, and reliable data on abandoned mines and wells is not available for most countries. These sources could, nonetheless, represent significant levels of emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicates they are responsible for close to 5% of energy-related methane in the United States; and a recent study estimated that abandoned mines could account for almost one fifth of methane emissions from worldwide coal production.", "The IEA Global Methane Tracker 2023 is our best attempt to reconcile existing information and produce a consistent set of country-level estimates. Further details on the methods used can be found in the Global Methane Tracker Documentation. We recognise these estimates do not represent the last word.

Emissions can also result from agriculture and livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Flaring burns unwanted gas and adds CO2 into the atmosphere, but it is an easy process to detect and has been increasingly frowned upon. Venting releases the invisible methane into the air completely unburned and has been harder to track until more recent developments in satellite technology.

On one hand, more governments and fossil fuel companies have committed to take action on methane. Global efforts to report emissions estimates consistently and transparently are strengthening, and studies suggest emissions are falling in some regions. However, overall emissions remain far too high to meet the world\u2019s climate goals. Large methane emissions events detected by satellites also rose by more than 50% in 2023 compared with 2022, with more than 5 Mt of methane emissions detected from major fossil fuel leaks around the world \u2013 including a major well blowout in Kazakhstan that went on for more than 200 days.\nMethane emissions from energy, 2000-2023\nOpenClose to 70% of methane emissions from fossil fuels come from the top 10 emitting countries", "Of the nearly 120 Mt of emissions we estimate were tied to fossil fuels in 2023, around 80 Mt came from countries that are among the top 10 emitters of methane globally. The United States is the largest emitter of methane from oil and gas operations, closely followed by the Russian Federation (hereafter \u201cRussia\u201d). The People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter \u201cChina\u201d) is by far the highest emitter in the coal sector. The amount of methane lost in fossil fuel operations globally in 2023 was 170 billion cubic metres, more than Qatar\u2019s natural gas production.", "The methane emissions intensity of oil and gas production varies widely. The best-performing countries score more than 100 times better than the worst. Norway and the Netherlands have the lowest emissions intensities. Countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, also have relatively low emissions intensities. Turkmenistan and Venezuela have the highest. High emissions intensities are not inevitable; they can be addressed cost-effectively through a combination of high operational standards, policy action and technology deployment. On all these fronts, best practices are well established.\nMethane emissions from oil and gas production and methane intensity for selected producers, 2023\nOpenCutting methane emissions from fossil fuels by 75% by 2030 is vital to limit warming to 1.5 \u00b0C", "The energy sector accounts for more than one third of total methane emissions attributable to human activity, and cutting emissions from fossil fuel operations has the most potential for major reductions in the near term. We estimate that around 80 Mt of annual methane emissions from fossil fuels can be avoided through the deployment of known and existing technologies, often at low \u2013 or even negative \u2013 cost.\nIn our Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario \u2013 which sees the global energy sector achieving net zero emissions by mid-century, limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 \u00b0C \u2013 methane emissions from fossil fuel operations fall by around 75% by 2030. By that year, all fossil fuel producers have an emissions intensity similar to the world\u2019s best operators today. Targeted measures to reduce methane emissions are necessary even as fossil fuel use begins to decline; cutting fossil fuel demand alone is not enough to achieve the deep and sustained reductions needed.", "Full implementation of COP28 and other pledges would cut fossil fuel methane emissions by 50%\nThe COP28 climate summit in Dubai produced a host of new pledges to accelerate action on methane. Importantly, the outcome of the first Global Stocktake called for countries to substantially reduce methane emissions by 2030. Additionally, more than 50 oil and gas companies launched the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) to speed up emissions reductions within the industry, new countries joined the Global Methane Pledge, and new finance was mobilised to support the reduction of methane and greenhouse gases (GHGs) other than carbon dioxide (CO2).", "Substantial new policies and regulations on methane were also established or announced in 2023, including by the United States, Canada, and the European Union and China published an action plan dedicated to methane emission control. A series of supportive initiatives have been launched to accompany these efforts, such as the Methane Alert and Response System and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative\u2019s Satellite Monitoring Campaign.", "Taken together, we estimate that if all methane policies and pledges made by countries and companies to date are implemented and achieved in full and on time, methane emissions from fossil fuels would decline by around 50% by 2030. However, in most cases, these pledges are not yet backed up by detailed plans, policies and regulations. The detailed methane policies and regulations that currently exist would cut emissions from fossil fuel operations by around 20% from 2023 levels by 2030. The upcoming round of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, which will see countries set climate goals through 2035, presents a major opportunity for governments to set bolder targets on energy-related methane and lay out plans to achieve them.\nReductions in methane emissions from fossil fuel operations from existing policies and pledges, 2020-2030\nOpenAround 40% of today\u2019s methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost", "Methane abatement in the fossil fuel industry is one of the most pragmatic and lowest cost options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The technologies and measures to prevent emissions are well known and have already been deployed successfully around the world. Around 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and sold or used. The share is higher for oil and natural gas (50%) than for coal (15%).", "There are many possible reasons why companies are not deploying these measures even though they pay for themselves. For example, the return on investment for methane abatement projects may be longer than for other investment opportunities. There may also be a lack of awareness regarding the scale of methane emissions and the cost-effectiveness of abatement. Sometimes infrastructure or institutional arrangements are inadequate, making it difficult for companies to receive the income from avoided emissions.\nRegardless of the value of captured gas, we estimate that it would be cost-effective to deploy nearly all fossil fuel methane abatement measures if emissions are priced at about USD 20/tonne CO2\u2011equivalent. Tapping into this potential will require new regulatory frameworks, financing mechanisms and improved emissions tracking.\nDelivering the 75% cut in methane emissions requires USD 170 billion in spending to 2030", "We estimate that around USD 170 billion in spending is needed to deliver the methane abatement measures deployed by the fossil fuel industry in the NZE Scenario. This includes around USD 100 billion of spending in the oil and gas sector and USD 70 billion in the coal industry. Through 2030, roughly USD 135 billion goes towards capital expenditures, while USD 35 billion is for operational expenditures.", "Fossil fuel companies should carry the primary responsibility for financing these abatement measures, given that the amount of spending needed represents less than 5% of the income the industry generated in 2023. Nonetheless, we estimate that about USD 45 billion of spending in low- and middle-income countries requires particular attention, as sources of finance are likely to be more limited. To date, we estimate that external sources of finance targeted at reducing methane in the fossil fuel industry total less than USD 1 billion, although this should catalyse a far greater level of spending.\nNew tools to track emissions will bring a step change in transparency", "Better and more transparent data based on measurements of methane emissions is becoming increasingly accessible and will support more effective mitigation. In 2023, Kayrros, an analytics firm, released a tool based on satellite imagery that quantifies large methane emissions on a daily basis and provides country-level oil and gas methane intensities. GHGSat, another technology company, increased its constellation of satellites in orbit to 12 and started to offer targeted monitoring of offshore methane emissions, while the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) ramped up usage of satellites to detect major methane emission events and alert government authorities and involved operators.", "Despite this progress, little or no measurement-based data is used to report emissions in most parts of the world \u2013 which is an issue since measured emissions tend to be higher than reported emissions. For example, if companies that report emissions to UNEP\u2019s Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 were to be fully representative of the industry globally, this would imply that global oil and gas methane emissions in 2023 were around 5 Mt, 95% lower than our estimate. Total oil and gas emissions levels reported by countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are close to 40 Mt, about 50% lower than our 2023 estimate. There are many possible reasons for these major discrepancies, but they will only be resolved through more systematic and transparent use of measured data.\nRegardless, all assessments make clear that methane emissions from fossil fuels operations are a major issue and that renewed action \u2013 by governments, companies, and financial actors \u2013 is essential."], "title": "Key findings \u2013 Global Methane Tracker 2024 \u2013 Analysis - IEA"}, {"url": "https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/overview", "description": "The report estimates that the global energy sector emitted 135 million tonnes of methane in 2021, a 5% increase from 2020, and that emissions are about 70% higher than reported by governments. It also highlights the importance of reducing methane leaks from oil and gas operations, especially in light of high gas prices and the Global Methane Pledge.", "snippets": ["Cite report\nIEA (2022), Global Methane Tracker 2022, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nOverview\nThe 2022 update of the IEA Global Methane Tracker for the first time includes emissions from the coal sector, creating a complete set of emission estimates for the energy sector and cementing the Tracker\u2019s indispensable role in the fight to bring down methane emissions and implement the new Global Methane Pledge.\nA rapid and sustained reduction of methane emissions is both achievable and essential to limit the rise in global average temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, today\u2019s concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are higher than at any time in at least 800 000 years, and methane has contributed around 30% of observed global warming to date.\nMethane emissions from the global energy sector rebounded by almost 5% in 2021", "We estimate that the global energy sector was responsible for around 135 million tonnes of methane emitted into the atmosphere in 2021. Following the Covid-induced decline in 2020, this represents a year-on-year increase in energy-related methane emissions of almost 5%, largely due to higher fossil fuel demand and production as economies recovered from the shock of the pandemic.\nThe inclusion in the Global Methane Tracker of country-by-country estimates for coal activities, alongside those for oil and gas operations, makes the People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter \u201cChina\u201d) the largest source of global energy-related methane emissions, with 28 million tonnes (Mt), followed by Russian Federation (hereafter \u201cRussia\u201d) (18 Mt) and the United States (17 Mt).", "The energy sector is responsible for around 40% of total methane emissions attributable to human activity, second only to agriculture. Of the 135 million tonnes of energy-related emissions, an estimated 42 Mt are from coal mine methane, 41 Mt from oil, 39 Mt are from extracting, processing and transporting natural gas, 9 Mt from the incomplete combustion of bioenergy (largely when wood and other solid biomass is used as a traditional cooking fuel), and 4 Mt leaks from end-use equipment.\nThe wasteful leakage of methane, the main component of natural gas, is all the more striking given today\u2019s backdrop of very tight and volatile gas markets. Methane leaks in 2021 from fossil fuel operations, if captured and marketed, would have made an additional 180 billion cubic metres of gas available to the market, an amount similar to all the gas used in Europe\u2019s power sector. This would have been comfortably enough to ease today\u2019s price pressures.", "Global methane emissions from the energy sector over time, 2000-2021\nOpenToday\u2019s elevated natural gas prices make an overwhelming case for strong action on abatement\nThe most cost-effective opportunities for methane abatement are in the energy sector, especially in oil and gas operations. Based on recent elevated natural gas prices, almost all of the options to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations worldwide could be implemented at no net cost. Such a strong alignment of cost, reputational and environmental considerations should push the oil and gas sector to lead the way with methane emissions reductions. Forward-leaning companies need to move beyond intensity targets and adopt a zero-tolerance approach.\nIf all countries were to perform as well as Norway, global methane emissions from oil and gas operations would fall by more than 90%", "The best companies and countries are showing what can be done to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations, but the intensity of methane emissions (emissions per unit of production) ranges widely. The best performing countries are more than 100 times better than the worst. Norway and the Netherlands have the lowest emissions intensities in our updated Tracker, and countries in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also have relatively low emissions intensities; Turkmenistan and Venezuela have the highest. If all producing countries were to match Norway\u2019s emissions intensity, global methane emissions from oil and gas operations would fall by more than 90%.", "Increased attention to methane abatement in recent years, including new measurement campaigns and technologies, may be having some effect. The estimated rise in energy-related methane emissions in 2021 leaves them slightly below where they were in 2019, even though overall energy demand and fossil fuel production are both back above pre-crisis levels. However, the limited availability of measured data for most countries means we cannot state with confidence where and how abatement efforts might actually be reducing emissions.\nTotal methane emissions and methane intensity of production in selected oil and gas producers, 2021\nOpenMethane emissions from the energy sector are about 70% higher than reported in official data", "Our emissions estimates, which are based on the latest available scientific studies and measurement campaigns, are significantly higher than the picture provided by official data. As more measured data becomes available, it becomes ever clearer that almost all the national inventories have been underreporting emissions. Emissions claimed for individual producing basins, fields and facilities are also typically lower than those observed once systematic monitoring and measurement systems are put in place.\nGlobally, our analysis finds that methane emissions from the energy sector are about 70% greater than the sum of estimates submitted by national governments. Much more needs to be done to enable a better understanding of emissions sources and to allow for comprehensive methane management.\nGlobal energy-related methane emissions by region reported to the UNFCCC and estimates from the IEA, 2021\nOpenSatellites are providing much-needed transparency on super-emitting methane leaks", "Satellites are providing a major boost to overall efforts to increase transparency on emissions sources, especially for very large leaks. Satellites are contributing important insights into the size and duration of large leaks in places such as the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia and across the United States, including the main US shale plays.\nSatellite-detected methane leaks from human activities, 2021\nThe areas open to observation by satellite are increasing but the coverage they provide is still far from complete: existing satellites do not provide measurements over equatorial regions, northern areas (including the main Russian oil and gas producing areas) or for offshore operations. Other measurement-based campaigns will remain essential, and the optimal system will combine satellite measurements with drone-based and other aerial surveys, ground-based sensors and surveys, and continuous monitoring devices.", "Large leaks from oil and gas operations were detected by satellite in 15 countries in 2021, with significant emissions from the Permian basin in Texas and very large leaks in parts of Central Asia. Turkmenistan alone was responsible for one-third of the very large emissions events seen by satellites in 2021. Relatively few major leaks were seen among the major onshore producers in the Middle East. In the 15 countries where observations were made, around 6% of our total estimate of methane emissions from oil and gas operations in 2021 were ultra-emitting events seen by satellites.\nThe new Global Methane Pledge is a vital step forward, although some major emitters remain outside it", "The Global Methane Pledge was launched by the United States and the European Union in November at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). Over 110 countries have now committed to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions from human activity (across all sources, not limited to energy) by at least 30% compared with 2020 levels by 2030.\nCutting the world\u2019s methane emissions by 30% over the next decade would have the same effect on global warming by mid-century as immediately shifting the global transport sector to net zero CO2 emissions. Achieving this goal requires countries to move rapidly from high-level commitments to country-level strategies, policies and action plans. The IEA\u2019s Regulatory Roadmap and Toolkit provides a step-by-step guide for countries seeking to drive down methane leaks from the oil and gas industry.", "Broadening the coalition of countries committed to ambitious methane reductions is essential. The world\u2019s five largest methane emitters (from all sources) are China, India, the United States, Russia and Brazil. Together, they are responsible for close to half of all methane emissions globally. Of these, only the United States and Brazil are part of the Global Methane Pledge. Looking only at energy-related emissions, the five largest emitting countries are China, Russia, the United States, Iran and India. Of these, only the United States is part of the Pledge.\nTop ten emitters of methane, 2021\nOpenIf all countries adopted tried and tested abatement policies, this would cut oil and gas methane leaks by half", "Uncertainty over emissions levels is no reason to delay action on methane. If all countries implemented tried and tested policies that have already been used effectively in multiple settings, it would cut global methane emissions from oil and gas operations in half. These include banning non-emergency flaring, imposing mandatory leak detection and repair programmes, and introducing equipment standards. Many hydrocarbon producing countries have policies in place they can build on.", "Our broad reviews of policies and regulations reveal some success stories that other countries can look to for inspiration. The United States and Canada have both implemented key tried and tested approaches, although there is still room to strengthen their requirements and expand coverage further. Norway and the Netherlands have gone the furthest towards adopting a comprehensive regime, as they have robust measurement and reporting requirements, ensure best industry practice, and economic incentives that encourage abatement action. Actions under the EU Methane Strategy will broaden these efforts across Europe.", "Tackling methane emissions from coal mines \u2013 included for the first time in this year\u2019s Tracker \u2013 is more challenging than tackling emissions from oil and gas operations, but it cannot be ignored. Coal-related methane emissions from China, the world\u2019s largest coal producer and emitter of coal mine methane, are equivalent to total CO2 emissions from international shipping. Significant opportunities remain to reduce methane emissions from coal mines based on existing technology, which could be essential given the risk that coal demand remains high in the coming years.\nEmissions from bioenergy are largely due to the incomplete combustion of solid biomass used as a cooking fuel in many developing economies. Accelerated progress towards universal access to clean cooking fuels would dramatically cut these emissions.\nMethane abatement potential of policy measures, 2022\nOpenA redoubled effort on methane is integral to the pathway to net zero emissions", "The pathway set out in the IEA\u2019s Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap \u2013 which would give the world an even chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C and avoiding the worst effects of climate change \u2013 requires energy-related methane emissions to fall by 75% by 2030. Reducing fossil fuel demand alone will not do the job quickly or effectively enough, which means early and concerted abatement efforts by governments and industry are essential. By 2030, all fossil fuel producers would need to reduce their emissions intensities down towards the level of the world\u2019s best operators today.", "The launch of the Global Methane Pledge needs to be a watershed moment for accelerated action on methane, building on the leadership that some countries and companies have already shown. Increased transparency on the sources of emissions \u2013 encouraged by initiatives like the International Methane Emissions Observatory \u2013 is essential. The IEA has been a longstanding champion of stronger action in this area. Methane emissions are avoidable, the solutions are proven and even profitable in many cases.

Not all countries have prepared a detailed UNFCCC inventory for 2019, while many others reported levels that do not match what was recorded by measurement campaigns. Some countries regularly update their inventories based on longstanding reporting frameworks that require companies to submit emissions data, such as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in the United States. Companies in these countries are working to improve measurement and monitoring. Other countries do not prepare annual inventory updates and may not have conducted national inventories in many years due to capacity or resource constraints. These considerations are explicitly recognised in the UNFCCC reporting framework, which has different requirements for Annex I and non-Annex I countries.", "The lack of an accurate baseline should not deter action to begin reducing emissions. There are a number of known solutions, described here, that can be implemented immediately, even with imperfect information.\nWhat could success look like for the Global Methane Pledge?\nDespite these practical and political challenges, there is still great potential for the Global Methane Pledge to catalyse action at the national level. Even without an accurate baseline, there are measures that can gauge progress \u2013 including whether countries have implemented new policy measures to improve measurement and encourage abatement.", "Meeting the Global Methane Pledge target has the potential to make an enormous impact on climate change, similar to the entire global transport sector adopting net zero emission technologies (see Methodology). Action will be particularly important in the period up to 2030 because sharp cuts in methane can deliver a net cooling effect within a relatively short period. This could keep the door open to a 1.5 \u00b0C stabilisation in global average temperatures, while the world pursues lasting reductions in CO2.\nThe Global Methane Pledge has brought together many important players in a joint international effort, including both major consumers like the European Union, Japan, Korea, and major producers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia. For some countries, the Global Methane Pledge represents the first significant policy commitment on methane, either at the domestic or international level.\nThe Global Methane Pledge is a major step forward, but on-the-ground implementation will be key", "For those countries where data is lacking, improving their inventory methodologies and ensuring comparability \u2013 incorporating direct measurement where possible and developing facility and source specific emissions factors \u2013 will be an important marker of early progress. Indeed, the Global Methane Pledge commits countries to move \u201ctowards using the highest tier IPCC good practice inventory methodologies.\u201d As data and measurement processes improve, comparisons across countries will become easier. In the meantime, modelling-based estimates can help fill this gap and inform progress tracking. Countries should also commit to regularly updating their UNFCCC inventories, particularly those that have not done so in many years.", "The shared goal is a targeted reduction in global emissions, even though some of the most important players have not yet joined, including China, India and the Russian Federation. It will be critical for participants to engage with countries that have not joined the Pledge in order to achieve the overall target. There are substantial opportunities for engagement with these countries. For example, in the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration, China committed to develop a \u201ccomprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane, aiming to achieve a significant effect on methane emissions control and reductions in the 2020s.\u201d\nTop twelve emitters of methane with breakdown by sector, 2021", "- Participating in a super-emitter rapid response system based on satellite detections, which would establish communication channels to ensure large emissions events are addressed in a timely manner;\n- Updating national greenhouse gas inventories on a regular basis and working to improve their quality (e.g. based on UNFCCC tiers), using emissions factors based on local measurements to enable a better assessment of emission sources; and\n- Directing funding towards research and development on abatement and measurement technologies and support for verifiable mitigation projects through grants, targeted finance or other incentives.", "As always with climate action, implementation is key. The text of the Global Methane Pledge states that the participants intend to review progress through annual ministerial meetings.

However, it may be several years before most countries can comprehensively track emissions reductions with the needed confidence. Until then, there are a number of actions that could signal progress. These could include:\n- Developing national action plans or strategies that identify specific actions to encourage emissions reduction, define timelines and assess needed resources;\n- Proposing new policies or regulations aimed at methane emissions, including measures like leak detection and repair programmes, technology and equipment standards, limits on flaring and venting, and measurement and reporting requirements;\n- Adopting national reduction targets, whether economy-wide or sectoral, to establish a political commitment, signal expectations and enable better planning;", "Cite report\nIEA (2022), Global Methane Tracker 2022, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022, Licence: CC BY 4.0\nThe Global Methane Pledge\nThe Global Methane Pledge was launched at COP26 in November 2021 to catalyse action to reduce methane emissions.
