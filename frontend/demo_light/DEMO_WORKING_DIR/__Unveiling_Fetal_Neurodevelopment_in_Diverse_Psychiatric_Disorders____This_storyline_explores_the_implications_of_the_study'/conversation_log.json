By around 5 weeks, the neural plate starts to fold onto itself, eventually forming the brain and spinal cord by week 6. Brain activity is also seen as early as week 6, and by week 10, the brain begins to resemble its final structure.\n\nThese findings are particularly important in understanding the risk of developing psychiatric disorders such as autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. A study published in Molecular Autism in 2024 found that there is a correlation between fetal brain growth and later infant autistic traits. This suggests that the fetal stage is a critical time for interventions that could potentially alter the trajectory of these disorders.\n\nFurthermore, the placenta may hold clues for early autism diagnosis and intervention. Researchers at UC Davis MIND Institute have identified a novel gene linked to fetal brain development and autism spectrum disorder, which is also affected by the mother's prenatal vitamin use and placental oxygen levels. This discovery could lead to potential interventions and treatments for individuals at risk of developing these disorders.\n\nIn terms of public health approaches, understanding the importance of fetal brain development in psychiatric disorders can inform policies and interventions to support mental health. It also raises ethical questions about prenatal genetic testing and the potential impact on societal understanding and stigma surrounding mental illness.", "user_utterance": "What are the key stages of fetal brain development, and how are they believed to be connected to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders?", "search_queries": ["Stages of fetal brain development", "Connection between fetal brain development and psychiatric disorders", "Autism and fetal brain development"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://flo.health/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/fetal-development/fetal-brain-development", "description": "Fetal brain growth is the core thing in prenatal development.

Your baby's nervous system is made up of millions upon millions of neurons. Each of these microscopic cells have itty-bitty branches coming off of them so that they can connect and communicate with each other.\nWith this comes your baby's first synapses, which essentially means neurons can interact and create early fetal movements, like curling into the fetal position.\nOther movements follow quickly, with your fetus wiggling his developing limbs at around 8 weeks. By the end of the first trimester, your baby-to-be has garnered quite a repertoire of motion, though you won't be able to feel it quite yet.\nAt about the same time as your baby first wiggles his limbs, he also begins to develop the sense of touch.\nSecond trimester", "Folate is essential for fetal cell growth, tissue development and DNA. Consuming enough before (and early in) pregnancy reduces a baby's chance of serious neural tube defects (like spina bifida) by 70 percent. Research also suggests that consuming enough of the nutrient can reduce the chances of an autism spectrum disorder by up to 40 percent.\nSo take your prenatal vitamin (which should have at least 400 mcg), and make sure to eat plenty of folate-rich foods (like leafy greens and whole grains).\nAnother important nutrient for brain (and eye) development: omega-3 fatty acids, specifically DHA (aka docosahexaenoic acid). Getting enough \u2014 especially during your third trimester, when your baby's brain is developing the fastest \u2014 is vital, since it's a major structural fat in the brain and eyes.", "The good news: DHA is found in lots of safe-to-eat fatty, cold water fish (like salmon, trout and sardines), along with DHA-fortified eggs. If you\u2019re vegan, talk to your doctor about whether you should take algal oil supplements to boost your DHA intake.\nWhen does the brain stop developing?\nYour baby\u2019s brain will continue to mature throughout childhood \u2014 with researchers estimating that the brain only stops developing around age 25!\nDuring the first three to five years of your little one\u2019s life, the brain develops rapidly. By the age of 9, all of the major structures are in place.", "That certainly doesn\u2019t mean brain development is done. The prefrontal lobe is the last area of the brain to develop, starting during the teen years. The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in what you might call \u201cadulting\u201d functions: goal-oriented decision making, memory encoding and retrieval, language and even intelligence. Until it\u2019s fully developed, the amygdala (the part of the brain responsible for gut reactions like fear) tends to drive decision-making.\nThroughout pregnancy and well beyond, your baby\u2019s brain develops at an astonishing pace, from a collection of cells to a fully-functioning decision-making center. You\u2019ll be thrilled when you feel those first fetal movements initiated by your baby's brain \u2014 and enamored when it connects those little eyes with yours for the very first time.", "At the tail-end of trimester two, your little one's brainstem (controlling heart rate, breathing and blood pressure) is almost entirely mature, resting just above the spinal cord but below the cerebral cortex (the last area to mature). By now, the fetal nervous system is developed enough so your baby can detect loud noises outside the womb \u2014 and may even turn his head toward the sound of your voice!\nAnother exciting development: At 28 weeks, fetal brainwave activity features sleep cycles, including REM (the stage when dreaming occurs).\nThird trimester\nThe third trimester is brimming with rapid development of neurons and wiring. His brain roughly triples in weight during the last 13 weeks of pregnancy, growing from about 3.5 ounces at the end of the second trimester to almost 10.6 ounces at term.\nYour baby\u2019s brain is starting to look different, too: Its once smooth surface is becoming increasingly grooved and indented (like the images of brains you're used to seeing).", "A mere 16 days after conception, your fetus's neural plate forms (think of it as the foundation of your baby's brain and spinal cord). It grows longer and folds onto itself, until that fold morphs into a groove and that groove turns into a tube \u2014 the neural tube.\nOnce the neural tube closes at around week 6 of pregnancy, it curves and bulges into three sections, commonly known as the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Just to the rear of the hindbrain sits the part that will turn into your baby's spinal cord.\nSoon, these areas bubble into those five different regions of the brain that we're most familiar with: the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, pituitary gland and the hypothalamus. Of course, all of these fetal brain areas need more time to be fully up and running!", "The fetal nervous system \u2014 i.e. your baby's brain, spinal cord and nerves \u2014 is one of the very first systems to develop. In fact, it's making big strides before you even know you're pregnant.\nWhen does a fetus develop a brain?\nFetal brain development starts probably before you even realize you\u2019ve conceived. When you\u2019re just 5 weeks pregnant, the first neural cells begin to divide and differentiate into neurons and glia (the two types of cells that form the nervous system).\nAlso at about week 5 of pregnancy, the neural plate folds onto itself to form the neural tube, which closes by about week 6 of pregnancy to eventually become the brain and spinal cord.\nBy about week 10, the brain is a small, smooth structure that looks a whole lot more like the brain you\u2019re used to (minus the folds that make up the various brain regions, which develop later in pregnancy).\nWhen does a fetus have brain activity?", "At the same time, the cerebellum (chiefly responsible for motor control) is developing fast \u2014 faster now than any other area of the fetal brain. Its surface area increases 30-fold in the last 16 weeks of pregnancy!\nAll of this growth is big news for the cerebral cortex (the part responsible for thinking, remembering and feeling). Though this important area of the brain is developing rapidly during pregnancy, it really only starts to function around the time a full-term baby is born \u2014 and it steadily and gradually matures in the first few years of life, thanks to your baby's enriching environment.\nWhat food is good for your baby\u2019s brain?\nBecause your baby's nervous system starts developing right out of the gate, it's important to consume 400 micrograms of folate (aka folic acid or vitamin B9) daily before getting pregnant and up that amount to 600 mcg once you do. Ideally, aim to start taking prenatal vitamins about three months before trying to conceive.", "During the second trimester, your baby's brain is directing steady contractions of the diaphragm and chest muscles (think of them as preliminary breathing movements).\nBaby's sucking and swallowing impulses will also get some practice. By 21 weeks, your baby's natural reflexes will allow him to swallow several ounces of amniotic fluid every day. And all of that swallowing means that your baby's tasting, too, another sense that's amping up.\nAt around 18 weeks of pregnancy, you'll feel your baby's first kick! (Don't worry if it takes a few weeks longer \u2014 that's common, especially among first-time moms.)\nAround the same time, your baby's nerves become covered with myelin, a protective insulation that speeds messages between nerve cells. Myelin will continue to grow until your baby's first birthday. And around 28 weeks, another big reflex occurs: blinking.", "The first synapses in baby\u2019s spinal cord form during week 7 of pregnancy. By week 8, electrical activity begins in the brain \u2014 allowing your baby to coordinate his first (spontaneous) movements that doctors can even see on an ultrasound!\nYour baby\u2019s brain continues to develop in the coming weeks, endowing him with a remarkable range of involuntary movements like stretching, yawning and sucking by the end of the first trimester and more coordinated movements in the second trimester.\nThat said, the brainstem, which controls vital functions like heart rate and breathing, isn\u2019t mostly complete until the end of the second trimester, and the cerebral cortex doesn\u2019t take up its duties until the third trimester.\nIn fact, the cerebral cortex \u2014 which is responsible for voluntary actions, thinking and feeling \u2014 only starts to work around the end of pregnancy, with simple electrical activity detectable in regions associated with senses (like touch) and motor skills in premature babies.", "Brain development timeline\nThere are five different regions of the brain that develop, each responsible for different functions:\n- Cerebrum: The biggest part of the brain, and it's responsible for thinking, remembering and feeling. This is where the cerebral cortex and its various lobes (including the frontal and temporal lobes) reside.\n- Cerebellum: The area in charge of motor control.\n- Brain stem: The engine driving many of your baby's most vital functions, including heart rate, breathing and blood pressure.\n- Pituitary gland: This pea-sized gland releases hormones into the body that are responsible for growth, metabolism and more.\n- Hypothalamus: This area deals with body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep and emotions.\nWith the biology lesson out of the way, read on to find out how and when these various parts start developing.\nFirst trimester"], "title": "Fetal Brain Development: When Your Baby Develops a Brain - What to Expect"}, {"url": "https://www.neurosciencefoundation.org/post/brain-development-in-fetus", "description": "Article By Sucharita DesuBrain development is a complex process.

These movements are controlled by the brain stem and allow the baby to practice breathing. In addition, at around week 16, the fetus begins to gain control over swallowing and sucking. By week 21, the fetus can properly swallow amniotic fluid. At the same time, the baby starts to test out other movements controlled by the cerebellum including kicking and stretching. In this trimester, the baby\u2019s brain stem has almost entirely developed, and the nervous system is developed enough to detect loud noises. Babies can even identify voices while still in the womb at this point! Lastly, a fetus also sends out brain waves during sleep, indicating that babies experience sleep cycles that include REM sleep (stage of dreaming), even before being born.", "In the third and final trimester, the brain of the fetus triples in size, growing from 3 ounces (about 85.05 g) to almost 11 ounces (about 311.84 g). The cerebrum also develops groves and ridges, and the brain separates into the left and right brain. Fun fact, the fastest growing part in the third trimester is the cerebellum, which is responsible for motor control. Thus, this is also the trimester where the baby begins to move more, from wiggling its fingers and toes to stretching and kicking. Plus, the fetus\u2019 sensory system begins to show integration and functionality in the third trimester.\nAs you know, our brain has separate parts responsible for different things. Some of these parts are developed after you are born, but the basis of it is developed in the womb. These parts are:\nCerebrum; it is the largest part, contains the cerebral cortex and frontal and temporal lobes, and is responsible for thinking, feeling, and memory.\nCerebellum; it directs body motor control.", "Brain stem; it oversees vital functions, mainly involuntary, like heart beating, blood pressure, and breathing, as well as the digestive process.\nPituitary gland; it releases hormones in the body.\nHypothalamus; it is responsible for regulating body temperature, hunger and thirst cues, sleep, and emotion.\nTo help babies and fetuses to grow and develop healthy brains, it is important to take necessary precautions. This includes eating a balanced diet, drinking plenty of water, as well as having enough folic acid and omega 3 fatty acid intake. Sources of harm to brain growth include alcohol consumption, smoking, illness, and infection in the mother, and cleaning a cat\u2019s litter box - because feline feces can contain dangerous parasites.", "From around week 7, once the neural tube is completely closed, the brain grows rapidly. In fact, the growth rate of the brain is around 250,000 neurons per minute! This rate stays the same for about another 21 weeks (until around week 28) before slowing down. As the brain grows millions of neurons, it also begins to connect synapses to direct movement and growth. Eventually, the brain will start sending out electric impulses to the rest of the body to carry out tasks. At as early as 8 weeks (about 2 months), you can see physical evidence of the brain working (the electric impulses) as ultrasounds show the embryo moving.\nA cool fact about the brain during the first trimester is the brain makes up half the fetus\u2019 weight! To compare, when a baby is born, the brain makes up only 10% of its weight.", "In the first trimester, the embryo forms a neural plate a couple of weeks after the baby\u2019s conception. This neural plate is the base for the nervous system. As it grows and becomes longer, it folds in on itself to become a neural tube. This happens from the first month to around 6 weeks (about 1 and a half months). At one end of the tube, there is a bulge which becomes the brain, while the rest stretches and develops into the spinal cord and the rest of the nervous system.

Longitudinal ultrasound measures of fetal brain parameters showed varying rates of growth between trimesters and correlations between them (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). HC and TCD were significantly correlated, particularly in the 3rd trimester. HC increased at a stable rate from the 1st to the 3rd trimester, which was mirrored by increases in TCD between the 2nd and 3rd trimester (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).

To date only a few studies have explored the relationship between fetal brain growth and later infant autistic traits, and some have used fetal head circumference (HC) as a proxy for brain development. These findings have been inconsistent. Here we investigate whether fetal subregional brain measurements correlate with autistic traits in toddlers.\nMethods", "When the infants were between 18 and 20 months (mean age; 18 months\u2019 and 22 days), parents completed an online version of the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT, validated in ages 18\u201330 months , suggested threshold of clinical significance > 39). 179 parents completed this online follow-up, corresponding to 92 female (mean score: 29.6, SD:7.6), 87 male (mean score: 30.0, SD:7.8) children (Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). 40 families (18.2% from the initial sample) did not participate in the postnatal follow-up section of the study.\nStatistics\nAnalysis", "There was no association between Q-CHAT scores and VA as measured at 20- or at 28 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks gestation, there was a significant positive association between TCD and Q-CHAT score (Pearson\u2019s correlation: r = 0.23, p = 0.003) (Fig. 3). This remained significant after standardizing TCD measurements for GA (Table 2) and when controlling for fetal sex, birth weight and maternal age in a multiple regression model (Model 3). The same trend was noted for TCD at 28 weeks\u2019 gestation, but this was no longer statistically significant when adjusting for GA (Model 2) or controlling for other covariates, such as sex and birth weight (Model 3)(Table 2). The opposite pattern was found for HC, which was significantly associated with Q-CHAT scores when measured at 28 weeks gestation in all models, but not when measured at 20 weeks gestation.\nDiscussion", "Cherskov A, Pohl A, Allison C, Zhang H, Payne RA, Baron-Cohen S.

Specifically, we found that a larger TCD as early as week 20 is associated with autistic traits in both males and females at 18\u201320 months. This finding further supports the potential inclusion of prenatal TCD as an early marker of later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The observed positive relationship between prenatal TCD size at 20 weeks\u2019 gestation and Q-CHAT score at 18\u201320 months could be introduced into early postnatal screening as a potential early marker for autism. In the future this could aid with early diagnosis and therefore could improve access to interventions and/or support early in development for those that want these services. However further longitudinal exploration is needed to validate this potential early marker, as well as its specificity to autistic traits", "Muller F, O\u2019Rahilly R.

During various stages of fetal development, standard ultrasound measurements were taken (Table 1). Fetal brain measures included HC, VA and TCD. These measurements are part of routine prenatal care in the UK and were taken by trained sonographers using standard ultrasound planes specific to each fetal measurement (Fig. 1).

But excessive oxidative stress may come from environmental exposures linked to ASD such as air pollution, pesticides, maternal obesity and inflammation,\u201d LaSalle said.", "Finally, they performed whole genome sequencing on 41 ASD and 37 TD MARBLES children.\nPlacenta to reveal insights into genes related to ASD\nThe researchers identified a block of differential methylation in ASD at 22q13.33, a region in chromosome 22 not previously linked to ASD. They located and characterized a novel gene known as LOC105373085 within that region and renamed it NHIP (neuronal hypoxia inducible, placenta associated).\nTo understand the function of this gene, they detected the levels of NHIP expression in human cell lines and brain tissue. They tested the responsiveness of NHIP to hypoxia, a state of low oxygen levels in the tissues. The researchers found that NHIP is a gene that gets turned on in neurons following hypoxia and regulates other gene pathways with functions in neuronal development and response to oxidative stress. Higher NHIP levels increased the cell division in an embryonic cell line.", "This is important because in the placenta, hypoxia triggers placental cell division to make further contact with maternal blood vessels to supply enough oxygen for the developing brain.\nThe researchers also discovered that NHIP was less activated in ASD placenta and brain compared to TD samples, supporting a protective role for NHIP in preventing ASD.\n\u201cWe found that the NHIP gene is active in the brain, responsive to oxidative stress, and influences expression of other known genes associated with autism,\u201d LaSalle said. \u201cIn most pregnancies, the placenta experiences some inevitable levels of stress.

Prenatal vitamins are high in folic acid and can reduce oxidative stress.", "Prenatal vitamins use during the first month of pregnancy showed a significant protective effect among individuals with genetic differences at 22q13.33 NHIP region.

This signature mark was linked to early fetal neurodevelopment.\n\u201cBy taking an unbiased approach to investigating placental DNA methylation differences, we discovered a novel gene in a poorly mapped region of the genome associated with autism, \u201d said Janine LaSalle, lead author on the study and professor of microbiology and immunology at UC Davis Health.", "The epigenome is a set of chemical compounds and proteins that tell the DNA what to do.

The neonatal epigenome can reflect past interactions between genetic and environmental factors during early development. It may also influence future health outcomes.\nThe placenta is a promising tissue for identifying DNA methylation changes at genes that also function in the fetal brain.

The first concerns the unexpected specificity of effects observed in neuroimaging studies. Glucocorticoid receptors are expressed throughout the developing nervous system. Why, then, are effects of maternal mental health or maternal glucocorticoid levels specific to the amygdala, and largely the right amygdala, as well as cortical regions? Why is there such little evidence from clinical studies for effects on the hippocampus, when the rodent and nonhuman primate studies reveal consistent effects on hippocampal structure? The issue here again may be that of the timing of human corticolimbic development, although existing studies suggest that the hippocampus and amygdala show comparable developmental trajectories. Likewise, the issue of asymmetric effects, most notably in measures of amygdala volume, remains a puzzle.", "Second, glucocorticoids are strongly linked to fetal growth, and there is compelling evidence for the association between maternal cortisol levels and neurodevelopment. However, there is surprisingly little evidence for an association between levels of maternal emotional well-being and increased HPA axis activity. Maternal anxiety or depression may increase transplacental passage of glucocorticoids (e.g.,\n76,\n88), but this possibility awaits direct study. Studies of glucocorticoids or any candidate mechanisms must also account for the unexpected specificity in the effects of antenatal maternal mental health as well as for the prominent effects of gender (\nFigure 1). Future research will need to resolve why a glucocorticoid treatment regimen sufficient to produce a decrease in birth weight does not necessarily affect neurodevelopment. It will also need to investigate why the amygdala, and in particular the right hemisphere, is so sensitive to the influences of antenatal maternal mood.", "53). This finding may reflect greater access to resources for pregnant women in developed countries, such as better nutrition and prenatal health services, that buffer against compromised birth outcomes that would otherwise be apparent. Nevertheless, the existing findings suggest that while clinical levels of maternal psychopathology may be associated with low birth weight, across nonclinical populations the level of depressive symptoms or anxiety is unrelated to birth outcomes. The assumption that birth weight necessarily reflects maternal stress/adversity across the normal population, especially in developed countries, is not yet justified by the existing literature. Low birth weight seems most reasonably interpreted as reflecting a less-than-optimal intrauterine environment (\n4).\nAntenatal Glucocorticoid Effects", "15). After controlling for multiple potential confounders, children of mothers with increased antenatal anxiety show a twofold increase in behavioral problems. Importantly, these effects equate to an approximate doubling of the population prevalence of childhood psychiatric disorders (\n15). A similar analysis showed that prenatal maternal stress accounted for 17% of the variance in childhood cognitive abilities (\n77). The situation is less clear for birth weight. Individuals born small show worse outcomes in terms of school achievement test scores, use of disability programs, residence in high-income areas, and wages (\n10). These findings suggest an economic impact. However, children born small are also more likely to be born into poverty to mothers of lower education (", "51). However, these effects are independent of maternal mental health, further underscoring the distinct influences of specific forms of maternal adversity. An extensive review (\n52) reveals an influence of severe stress (e.g., death of a spouse) on offspring birth weight, as well as of factors such as social support that moderate the impact of stress, but no consistent evidence for the influence of maternal anxiety or depression (also see reference\n53). The exceptions are studies showing an association between \u201cpregnancy-associated anxiety\u201d and birth outcomes, which again underscores the specificity of different forms of maternal \u201cadversity.\u201d\nWhile extremely stressful conditions may affect birth outcomes, large epidemiological studies with community samples (e.g.,\n45) have reported no association between maternal levels of depression, anxiety, or stress and either birth weight or gestational age. Likewise, a meta-analysis examining maternal depression and birth weight (", "This issue is of considerable importance for the evaluation of treatment outcomes of prevention/intervention programs, as the failure to account for differential vulnerability could underestimate the \u201ctreatment\u201d effect among more vulnerable individuals. These considerations also underscore the importance of longitudinal approaches with sample sizes sufficient to effectively stratify subjects according to risk factors. Such studies might better address the issue of clinical significance, as environmental effects could be evaluated on the basis of adversity in earlier developmental periods.\nConclusions", "While antenatal maternal cortisol levels may be associated with HPA function in offspring, the interpretation is subject to concerns of heritable genetic influences. HPA function shows an intriguing, context-dependent heritability (", "10), as well as to mothers with high-risk lifestyles that include smoking and increased alcohol consumption, which predict low birth weight. In the 1958 British cohort study of 10,845 children, birth weight accounted for 0.5%\u22121.0% of the variation in math scores, whereas social class accounted for 2.9%\u221212.5% (\n78). Another study (\n15) showed that obstetric outcomes (birth weight and gestation age) explained <1% of additional variance in child emotional/behavioral difficulties when maternal mental health and socioeconomic status variables were accounted for. These studies suggest that although the impairments in neurodevelopment associated with low birth weight are functionally relevant, the magnitude of the impact uniquely associated with fetal growth per se remains unclear.", "Research on the fetal origins of individual differences in neurodevelopment has attracted attention to a period of development previously undervalued in importance for later mental health. DOHaD studies provide an empirical basis for multidisciplinary programs across obstetrics/gynecology, neonatology, pediatrics, neuroscience, and psychiatry/psychology and are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the relation between maternal health, fetal growth, and neurodevelopment. This same partnership is critical for clinical programs that target maternal health.", "81). The effect of breastfeeding on cognitive development is greater in low compared with normal birth weight children (\n85). Likewise, there is evidence for the idea that the impact of interventions or of high-quality day-care programs may be greater among children born at low birth weight (e.g.,\n86). This meta-plasticity may extend to the influence of antenatal glucocorticoids. The effect of socioeconomic status on long-term memory is greater among children exposed to antenatal glucocorticoid treatment (\n87).", "72), and stratification by genotype yielded effect sizes beyond those commonly reported for studies of birth weight alone. Qiu et al. (\n22) reported that offspring\nCOMT genotype actually determined the nature and regional specificity of the influence of antenatal maternal anxiety on cortical morphology.\nOne approach to examining genetic variation is to compare the moderating influence of the maternal and offspring genotypes. For example, the\nBDNF genotype of the infant, but not that of the mother, moderates the influence of antenatal maternal anxiety on genome-wide DNA methylation (\n21). Indeed, a survey of interindividual variability in DNA methylation across the genome in umbilical cord samples shows that the vast majority (\u223c80%) of such variation is principally determined by an interaction between maternal condition or birth outcome and infant genotype (", "73). The increased risk of major depressive disorder among individuals born small (<2.5 kg) is greater among children of depressed than nondepressed parents (\n74). The implication is that the effect of birth weight on later depression is greater among those with a depressed parent, which suggests moderation by genetic influences. A polygenic risk score calculated from genome-wide association studies of major depressive disorder could be used in such studies as a measure of individual cumulative genetic vulnerability (\n75). Studies of the relation between maternal conditions and birth outcomes might likewise benefit from genetically informed designs. Hypofunctional 11\u03b2-HSD-2 variants, for example, might define instances where increased maternal stress is more likely to be associated with increased fetal cortisol exposure (\n35,\n37,", "developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, which suggests that the quality of fetal development shapes individual differences in the risk for chronic illness over the lifespan. The DOHaD theme is familiar in psychiatry/psychology, which emphasizes the importance of early developmental influences as determinants of mental health and human capacity. DOHaD studies reflect the importance of antenatal maternal well-being and fetal growth for individual differences in vulnerability to adverse mental health outcomes, which could inform precision medicine and intervention programs in psychiatry (\n3). We briefly review the evidence for the importance of the antenatal period for neurodevelopment outcomes and suggest challenges for future research, including studies that enable the integration of findings from DOHaD studies into clinical practice and public policy.\nChallenges for DOHaD Models of Mental Health\nThe Term \u201cMaternal Adversity\u201d", "82). These findings reveal that the consequences of fetal adversity on child development are dependent on the quality of the postnatal environment.\nIndeed, various forms of prenatal adversity may actually increase the sensitivity of the developing organism to the influences of the postnatal environment (\n83). This \u201cmeta-plasticity\u201d refers not to the influence of antenatal adversity on any specific outcome, but rather to the degree to which the developing organism is susceptible to subsequent environmental influences. The quality of intrauterine environment might explain, in part, the wide diversity among children in the degree to which developmental outcomes are influenced by prevailing context (\n84), a possibility that could inform and improve early interventions strategies.\nIn the studies noted above, the effects of socioeconomic status or maternal care are greater among low compared with normal birth weight offspring (\n27,\n78\u2013", "Third, future research must clearly assess the clinical relevance of the individual antenatal factors that influence fetal neurodevelopment. Nanni et al. (\n89) have provided evidence for the role of childhood maltreatment as a significant predictor of illness course and treatment outcomes in depression: childhood maltreatment predicts treatment resistance to antidepressant medications, although not psychotherapy. A comparable level of evidence is lacking for antenatal exposures and should assess the degree to which such factors independently account for variation in mental health outcomes as well as the degree to which such factors might inform clinical practice (\n14). Future research should also focus on the potential importance of antenatal factors for the effective identification of high-risk individuals in early childhood for prevention programs.", "Fetal development clearly matters. Nevertheless, the science of fetal origins of psychopathology faces important challenges. First, current models suffer from the inclusion of multiple antenatal maternal conditions in the broad category of \u201cadversity.\u201d Symptoms of depression or anxiety or responses to stressful circumstances are not synonymous in their underlying biology. Nor do these conditions readily map onto variations in fetal growth. Studies that relate specific maternal conditions and birth outcomes to specific neurodevelopmental consequences bear greater promise in our studies of underlying mechanisms.", "76) and thus greater effects on birth weight and neurodevelopment. These considerations suggest that the transition of DOHaD science from observational studies to those of biological mechanisms will require the integration of genetic information into developmental models. Since vulnerability is seemingly best defined by measures of both environmental risk and genetic predisposition, the inclusion of genetic information is also important for the most precise targeting of interventions.\nClinical Significance\nMaternal mental health and birth outcomes predict child health and development. But are these effects functionally relevant and clinically informative? The impact of maternal emotional well-being on child outcomes has been assessed (\n14,", "Mothers with female fetuses at risk for virilization through congenital adrenal hyperplasia are treated with synthetic glucocorticoids in the first trimester to suppress endogenous pituitary-adrenal activity. The offspring show altered cognitive performance, including inattention, as well as increased fearfulness (for a review, see reference\n54). Antenatal treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids predicts increased HPA reactivity to stress in neonates born at term (\n55). Antenatal glucocorticoid treatment is also associated with increased cortisol responses to the Trier social stress test in older children, an effect unique to female offspring (\n56). These findings are consistent with studies reporting an association between increased maternal antenatal cortisol levels and infant HPA reactivity to stress (e.g.,\n57,\n58).", "Measures of stressful life events, the perception of stress, depressive symptoms, and levels of state, trait, or pregnancy-related anxiety are commonly used to indicate maternal adversity. This clustering implies an assumption of common influences and/or underlying mechanisms. The evidence suggests otherwise. When studied across the normal range, maternal anxiety appears to more consistently predict neurodevelopmental outcomes than do depressive symptoms (\n14,\n40), although a direct comparison is difficult to operationalize. And subtle distinctions within specific forms of \u201cadversity\u201d seem important. For example, while trait anxiety accounts for a proportion of pregnancy-related anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety may have greater predictive value for obstetric or child outcomes than more global measures of maternal anxiety (e.g.,\n41,\n42).", "69). High heritability of HPA reactivity is evident among children in families with low adversity, but not in families with high adversity. High familial adversity is associated with greater cortisol reactivity to stress. Since the majority of children enrolled in community-based studies are likely drawn from low-adversity settings, the association between antenatal maternal cortisol and HPA function in the offspring may reflect heritable genetic influences. Moreover, since glucocorticoids are a well-established mechanism for low birth weight, these same considerations might influence the interpretation of associations between birth weight and HPA function. The concern for genetic mediation is underscored by a study showing that among seven confirmed genome-wide loci that account for variance in birth weight, with effects comparable to maternal smoking, three are also associated with cardiovascular (\nADRB1) or metabolic disease (\nADCY5, CDKAL1) (", "66), suggesting that the well-documented relation between birth weight and cardiometabolic outcomes may partly reflect common underlying genetic features.\nThere has been surprisingly little emphasis on the moderating effect of offspring genotype in studies linking birth weight or maternal stress to neurodevelopment. The consideration of heritable genetic variation is not simply an issue for the interpretation of epidemiological studies. The inclusion of genetics in DOHaD research models provides the opportunity to expand the breadth of research focusing on antenatal environmental influences to discern the degree to which such effects are moderated by offspring genotype. Existing studies reveal that associations between birth weight and child socioemotional development are moderated by variants in multiple genes implicated in serotonergic or dopaminergic function (e.g.,\nTPH2,\nHTR2A,\nSCL6A4, DRD4) (\n70\u2013", "68) examined this issue using a variation of a prenatal cross-fostering study in humans in which pregnant mothers were genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of in vitro fertilization. Associations between antenatal stress and offspring outcome that are environmental in origin should be observed in both unrelated and related mother-child pairs. Antenatal stress in late pregnancy is associated with birth weight, anxiety, and antisocial behavior in both related and unrelated mother-offspring pairs, consistent with an environmental influence. In contrast, the link between prenatal stress and ADHD-like features is present only in related mother-offspring pairs and is therefore potentially attributable to heritable genetic influences or gene-environment interplay.", "One potential source of confusion is the assumption that various forms of maternal adversity, including depression, anxiety, and stress, are associated with increased glucocorticoid levels and thus reduced birth weight and birth weight\u2013associated outcomes. There is indeed compelling evidence for the role of glucocorticoids in fetal growth restriction. However, only a subset of patients with clinical depression show hypercortisolemia, and to our knowledge there are conflicting data on the association of anxiety with cortisol levels. Studies employing momentary assessments of maternal mood states show covariation between negative mood in pregnancy and salivary cortisol (e.g.,\n43); however, a number of studies find little or no association between maternal cortisol levels and measures of maternal stress, anxiety, or depression (\n25,\n44\u2013", "There is considerable evidence that the influence of intrauterine factors on neurodevelopment is modified by postnatal environmental conditions. Low birth weight predicts adolescent depression more strongly in girls with a history of adverse postnatal experiences, which suggests that the effects of prenatal experiences are conditional on the postnatal environment (\n11). Likewise, the association between birth weight and hippocampal volume is moderated by the quality of parental care (\n27). Socioeconomic status appears to moderate the effects of fetal growth restriction on irritability and impulsivity (\n79). The well-established association between birth weight and ADHD is absent in suburban communities (\n80), suggesting effects that are context dependent, and an enhanced quality of maternal care eliminates the association between birth weight and ADHD symptoms (\n81). Likewise, mother-infant attachment moderates the influence of maternal glucocorticoids on socioemotional development (", "47). Indeed, pregnancy in humans and other mammals is associated with dampened HPA stress reactivity. Detailed studies reveal no association of maternal salivary (\n19), plasma, or amniotic cortisol levels (\n46,\n47) with either maternal stress or anxiety. Sarkar et al. (\n47) reported a weak correlation between maternal anxiety and plasma cortisol, and only in early pregnancy. In contrast, O\u2019Connor et al. (\n48) reported an association between maternal depression and diurnal cortisol levels in a low-socioeconomic-status sample, while one study (\n49) has reported increased cortisol levels in pregnant women with comorbid anxiety and depression. These findings suggest that the relation between maternal mental health and glucocorticoid exposure may lie within specific subgroups, including women with more severe mental health conditions.", "Finally, it is difficult to imagine how environmental influences could operate in the absence of genetic moderation. Environmental signals influence brain development and function through effects on intracellular signaling pathways, the activity of which inevitably varies across individuals in part as a result of sequence-based, heritable genetic variation. Thus, the influence of antenatal maternal conditions on neurodevelopment will vary as a function of the genotype of the offspring. Studies that incorporate the analysis of genomic variation may identify gene networks that moderate the impact of antenatal environmental influences and thus elucidate the underlying biological pathways.", "53) revealed a relation using categorical measures of depression, reflecting symptoms in the clinical range, but little or no association between birth weight and continuous measures of depressive symptoms, despite the fact that these same measures predict neurodevelopmental outcomes (see above). Interestingly, the association between clinical depression and birth outcome is strong in developing but not developed countries (", "The association between birth weight and cardiometabolic health catalyzed interest in the fetal origins of noncommunicable disease (\n1,\n2). Importantly, the relation between birth weight and metabolic health is broadly continuous: the risk of metabolic disease declines with increasing birth weight up to the point of macrosomia, where it once again increases. More successful pregnancies (i.e., optimal fetal growth) are associated with better metabolic health. These studies (\n1,\n2) contributed to the emphasis on maternal health as a global priority for the World Health Organization (\nhttp://www.who.int/pmnch) and the International Monetary Fund (\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/mdg.htm).\nStudies of fetal growth and adult health outcomes spawned the idea that intrauterine signals \u201cprogram\u201d the development of tissue function in a manner that predisposes to specific health outcomes. This idea is framed as the", "Antenatal maternal mood, cortisol levels, and stress all predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, but the evidence to date suggests that these factors are not necessarily associated with each other, and there is even less evidence to suggest that maternal glucocorticoid levels\nmediate the effects of maternal adversity on neurodevelopment. Rather, the evidence suggests that these effects may operate through different pathways, and thus a broader survey of potential mediating mechanisms is called for (\n50). Indeed, studies of the specific outcomes associated with distinct antenatal influences should enhance our ability to elucidate specific mechanisms.\nRelation Between Maternal Mental Health and Birth Outcomes\nIntense maternal stress, such as exposure to Hurricane Katrina, is associated with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) (", "Glucocorticoids are also used clinically in the third trimester to advance pulmonary development in the fetus when there is a risk for preterm delivery. In contrast to the congenital adrenal hyperplasia findings, clinical trials report surprisingly few effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment on neurodevelopmental outcomes. These studies involve powerful synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonists, such as dexamethasone and betamethasone, which, unlike cortisol, are poor substrates for placental 11\u03b2-HSD-2. A randomized controlled trial comparing antenatal betamethasone with placebo with follow-up in adulthood found no differences between groups exposed to betamethasone and placebo in cognitive functioning, working memory and attention, psychiatric morbidity, or health-related quality of life (\n59). Similarly, a trial comparing single versus multiple antenatal glucocorticoid treatments found no differences in measures of neurocognitive function (", "60). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that chronic glucocorticoid treatment during pregnancy reduced fetal growth, but with no discernible effects on neurodevelopment (\n61,\n62). These findings contrast with those described above, and especially noteworthy is the absence of effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment designed to enhance pulmonary maturation compared with treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Importantly, the latter routinely involves treatment in the first trimester, whereas the former targets mid to late pregnancy. The timing of glucocorticoid treatment or exposure over the course of pregnancy, at various stages of neurodevelopment, could potentially explain seemingly conflicting findings (\n63). Nevertheless, in relation to the broader DOHaD hypothesis, it should be noted that a glucocorticoid treatment in later pregnancy that reliably reduces birth weight is not consistently associated with long-term effects on neurodevelopment.", "The relevance of variation in fetal growth across the population for clinical medicine and intervention programs must be determined. This issue is not unique to the study of mental health outcomes. Despite the many years since the initial reports linking fetal growth to the metabolic syndrome, it remains unclear to what extent fetal development might account for clinical cases of metabolic or cardiovascular disease: What percentage of the patients with the metabolic syndrome were born small? Does fetal growth retardation predict differential clinical outcomes or, importantly, suggest alternative treatment strategies?

However, progress in our understanding of the origins of mental health will depend on our ability to successfully meet the demands of research that focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes at the level of the individual child.", "A second issue is the consistent finding of gender differences. A variety of studies have reported effects of maternal cortisol levels or birth weight that are apparent only in female offspring (\n11,\n27,\n64). Models that rely on the importance of stress mediators will need to be expanded to explain the specificity of effects in terms of gender or neurodevelopmental outcome.\nGenetic Influences\nThe study of antenatal influences relies on measures of maternal conditions or birth outcomes that are linked to genetic variation (e.g.,\n65,\n66). Yet few studies have addressed the possibility that the reported associations share a common genetic basis. For example, perceived stress is a heritable trait (\n67), suggesting that the effects of heritable genetic variants may account, in part, for reported associations between maternal stress and measures of child temperament, including stress reactivity, or more generally the risk for psychopathology in the offspring.

The potential for a fetus to be affected by genetic disorders that are not evaluated by the screening or diagnostic test should also be reviewed. Even if patients have a negative screening test result, they may choose diagnostic testing later in pregnancy, particularly if additional findings such as fetal anomalies identified on ultrasound examination become evident.\n- Patients whose cell-free DNA screening test results are not reported by the laboratory or are uninterpretable (a no\u2010call test result) should be informed that test failure is associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, receive further genetic counseling and be offered comprehensive ultrasound evaluation and diagnostic testing.", "- Cell-free DNA screening can be performed in twin pregnancies. Overall, performance of screening for trisomy 21 by cell-free DNA in twin pregnancies is encouraging, but the total number of reported affected cases is small. Given the small number of affected cases it is difficult to determine an accurate detection rate for trisomy 18 and 13.\n- Because preimplantation genetic testing is not uniformly accurate, prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis should be offered to all patients regardless of previous preimplantation genetic testing.\n- The use of multiple serum screening approaches performed independently (eg, a first-trimester screening test followed by a quad screen as an unlinked test) is not recommended because it will result in an unacceptably high positive screening rate and could deliver contradictory risk estimates.", "- In clinical situations of an isolated soft ultrasonographic marker (such as echogenic cardiac focus, choroid plexus cyst, pyelectasis, short humerus or femur length) where aneuploidy screening has not been performed, the patient should be counseled regarding the risk of aneuploidy associated with the finding and cell-free DNA, quad screen testing, or amniocentesis should be offered. If aneuploidy testing is performed and is low risk, then no further risk assessment is needed. If more than one marker is identified, then genetic counseling, maternal\u2013fetal medicine consultation, or both are recommended.\n- No method of aneuploidy screening that includes a serum sample is as accurate in twin gestations as it is in singleton pregnancies; this information should be incorporated into pretest counseling for patients with multiple gestations.", "Policy Priorities\nCurrent ACOG Guidance\nNIPT Summary of Recommendations\n- Prenatal genetic screening (serum screening with or without nuchal translucency [NT] ultrasound or cell-free DNA screening) and diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling [CVS] or amniocentesis) options should be discussed and offered to all pregnant patients regardless of maternal age or risk of chromosomal abnormality. After review and discussion, every patient has the right to pursue or decline prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing.\n- If screening is accepted, patients should have one prenatal screening approach, and should not have multiple screening tests performed simultaneously.\n- Cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for the common fetal aneuploidies.

It aims to answer the following questions, in a global context: For women in the perinatal period, do screening programmes for perinatal depression and anxiety compared with no screening improve maternal mental health and infant outcomes?A series of meta-analyses reveal a reduction in perinatal depression and anxiety among perinatal women undergoing screening programmes. For the outcome of depressive disorder, meta-analysis indicates a positive impact in favour of the intervention group (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.66, n = 9009), with moderate quality of evidence. A significant improvement (high quality) was also observed in symptoms of anxiety among perinatal women (SMD = - 0.18, 95% CI: - 0.25 to - 0.12, n = 3654).", "Postpartum depression and anxiety are highly prevalent worldwide. Fisher et al., estimated the prevalence of depression and anxiety at 15.6% during the antenatal and 19.8% during the postpartum period. Their impact on maternal and child health is well-recognized among the public health community, accounting for high societal costs. The public health impact of these conditions has highlighted the need to focus on the development and provision of effective prevention and treatment strategies.In recent decades, some advances have been made in the development of effective universal and targeted screening programmes for perinatal depression and anxiety disorders. Recent research has shown potential benefits of universal and targeted screening for perinatal depression, to identify and treat undiagnosed cases, and help thwart its deleterious consequences.

Currently, there are two types of prenatal tests for genetic disorders: prenatal screening tests and invasive tests. Noninvasive screening tests, such as ultrasonography and blood tests, are often the first step in detecting any abnormalities. However, if results are abnormal, a pregnant woman may choose to undergo more accurate invasive tests such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests involve a small risk of harm to the fetus, so it is crucial for expectant parents to weigh the benefits and risks before making a decision.\n\nIn the future, as we gain a deeper understanding of the role of fetal neurodevelopment in psychiatric disorders, it is possible that prenatal screening tests may evolve to include screening for genetic predispositions to these disorders. This could have implications for early intervention and potential alterations in life trajectories for those at risk. However, as with any advancements in prenatal testing, there may be ethical considerations to be addressed, such as the potential for discrimination or stigmatization of individuals with a genetic predisposition to a mental health disorder.\n\nIt is also important to recognize the impact of mental health on perinatal experiences. While postpartum depression is increasingly recognized, there is still a lack of awareness and understanding surrounding perinatal suicide risk. The American Journal of Psychiatry recently published a journal that explores the need for increased awareness and identification of perinatal suicide risk, highlighting the importance of addressing this critical issue.\n\nIn conclusion, as we delve deeper into the connections between fetal neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders, it is essential to consider how this may influence prenatal screening practices and healthcare policies.

The most common risk is that of miscarriage, which occurs in about 1 in 500 procedures.\nRarely, the genetic diagnosis is unclear after chorionic villus sampling, and amniocentesis may be necessary. In general, the accuracy of the two procedures is comparable.\nPercutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling\nIn percutaneous (through the skin) umbilical blood sampling, the doctor first anesthetizes an area of skin over the abdomen. Guided by ultrasonography, the doctor then inserts a needle through the abdominal wall and uterus into the umbilical cord. A sample of the fetus\u2019s blood is withdrawn and analyzed, and the needle is removed. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling is an invasive procedure. It may cause miscarriage in about 1 in 100 procedures.", "For both procedures, doctors use ultrasonography to guide them as they insert the catheter or needle and suction out the tissue sample with a syringe. The sample is then sent for analysis. Many women have light spotting for a day or two after either of these procedures.\nAfter chorionic villus sampling, women who have Rh-negative blood and who do not have antibodies to Rh factor are given an injection of Rho(D) immune globulin to prevent them from producing antibodies to Rh factor. When a woman with Rh-negative blood has a fetus with Rh-positive blood (called Rh incompatibility), she may produce these antibodies if the fetus's blood comes into contact with her blood, as it may during chorionic villus sampling. These antibodies can cause problems in the fetus. The injection is not needed if the father also has Rh-negative blood because in such cases, the fetus always has Rh-negative blood.", "Prenatal testing for genetic disorders and birth defects involves testing a pregnant woman or fetus before birth (prenatally) to determine whether the fetus has certain abnormalities, including certain hereditary or spontaneous genetic disorders. Noninvasive screening tests (such as ultrasonography or blood tests) are often done first, and if the results are abnormal, a pregnant woman can decide whether to have invasive testing. Invasive tests, such as chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, and percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, use a sample of the fetus's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are more accurate. However, they may involve a low risk of losing the pregnancy or harm to the fetus.", "Serum marker testing of the mother's blood may test for chromosomal abnormalities, neural tube defects, or both.\nThe choice of which serum marker testing to use may depend on timing (getting test results early in pregnancy), other preferences of the prospective parents, or which test a clinic or hospital usually uses. Important markers include the following:\nAlpha-fetoprotein: A protein produced by the fetus\nPregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A): A protein produced by the placenta\nEstriol: A hormone formed from substances produced by the fetus\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin: A hormone produced by the placenta\nInhibin A: A hormone produced by the placenta\nSerum marker screening can consist of different combinations of tests. Markers are usually measured at 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy (first-trimester screening). Other markers are measured at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy (second-trimester screening).", "If women have Rh-negative blood, they are given Rho(D) immune globulin after the procedure to prevent them from producing antibodies to Rh factor.

These antibodies can cause problems in a fetus with Rh-positive blood. The injection is not needed if the father also has Rh-negative blood because in such cases, the fetus always has Rh-negative blood.\nAmniocentesis rarely causes any problems for the woman or the fetus. The following may occur:\nSoreness: Some women feel slightly sore for an hour or two afterward.\nSpotting of blood or leakage of amniotic fluid from the vagina: About 1 to 2% of the women have these problems, but the problems do not last long and usually stop without treatment.", "Ultrasonography is commonly done as a routine test during pregnancy. It has no known risks for the woman or fetus. Ultrasonography can do the following:\nIndicate whether the fetus is alive\nDetermine if more than one fetus is present\nConfirm the age of the fetus (gestational age)\nLocate the placenta\nIn the second trimester, detect certain obvious structural birth defects, including those of the brain, spinal cord, heart, kidneys, stomach, abdominal wall, and bones, some of which may indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus", "In this procedure, a sample of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniotic fluid) is removed and analyzed. Amniocentesis is usually done at 15 weeks of pregnancy or later. The fluid contains cells that have been shed by the fetus. These cells are grown in a laboratory so that the chromosomes in them can be analyzed. Amniocentesis enables doctors to measure the level of alpha-fetoprotein (a protein produced by the fetus) in the amniotic fluid. This measurement more reliably indicates whether the fetus has a brain or spinal cord defect than does measurement of this level in the woman\u2019s blood.\nDetecting Abnormalities Before Birth\nBefore the procedure, ultrasonography is done to evaluate the heart of the fetus, to confirm the length of the pregnancy, to locate the placenta and amniotic fluid, and to determine how many fetuses are present.", "Targeted ultrasonography using high-resolution equipment can be done at some specialized centers. It provides more detail and may be more accurate than standard ultrasonography, particularly for small birth defects. Targeted ultrasonography done during the second trimester can help estimate the risk of a chromosomal abnormality. Targeted ultrasonography aims to identify certain structural birth defects that indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality. This test can also detect certain variations in organs that do not affect function but may indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality. However, normal results do not necessarily mean that there is no risk of a chromosomal abnormality.\nInvasive Tests for Prenatal Diagnosis", "If pregnancy is to be achieved using in vitro fertilization, genetic disorders can sometimes be diagnosed before the fertilized egg is transferred from the culture dish to the uterus (called preimplantation genetic diagnosis). (See also Overview of Chromosome and Gene Disorders and Overview of Birth Defects.)\nProspective parents should remember that screening tests are not always accurate. Screening tests may miss abnormalities or may indicate abnormalities when none are present.\nCell-Free DNA Screening Test\nA common method of screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, is analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the mother's blood, which can be done as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy. For this test, small fragments of the fetus's DNA, which are present in the mother's blood in tiny amounts, are analyzed. Detection rates using this technology are higher than most other noninvasive methods.\nSerum Marker Screening Test", "Ultrasonography is done if blood tests detect an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein level in a pregnant woman.\nAmniocentesis is an invasive test done if further testing is needed. It enables doctors to measure the alpha-fetoprotein level in the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniotic fluid), to analyze the fetus\u2019s chromosomes, and to determine whether the amniotic fluid contains an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. Knowing what the alpha-fetoprotein level is and whether acetylcholinesterase is present helps doctors better assess risk for a neural tube defect or other abnormality.\nA high alpha-fetoprotein level or the presence of acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid suggests\nA neural tube defect\nAn abnormality in another structure, such as the esophagus, kidneys, or abdominal wall\nA high alpha-fetoprotein level plus acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid indicates a high risk of\nA neural tube defect, such as anencephaly or spina bifida\nUltrasonography", "If a pregnant woman has abnormal results on a prenatal blood test or a family history of birth defects (such as heart birth defects or cleft lip and palate), ultrasonography can be done to evaluate the fetus. However, normal results do not guarantee the fetus has no abnormalities, because not all abnormalities can be detected. Certain conditions, such as neural tube defects, are still possible. Results of ultrasonography may suggest chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, but ultrasonography cannot identify the specific problem. In such cases, amniocentesis may be recommended.", "Several procedures can be used to directly test fetal genetic material for genetic and chromosomal abnormalities. These tests are invasive (that is, they require insertion of an instrument into the body) and have a slight risk of miscarriage or harm to the fetus.\nAmniocentesis\nOne of the most common procedures for detecting abnormalities before birth is amniocentesis. It is often offered to women over age 35 because they have a higher risk of having a fetus with chromosomal abnormalities than younger women. However, many doctors offer this test to all pregnant women, and any pregnant woman can request it, even if her risk is not higher than normal.", "If pregnancy is to be achieved using in vitro (test tube) fertilization, doctors can sometimes diagnose genetic disorders in the embryo before it is transferred to the woman\u2019s uterus. Preimplantation genetic testing requires technical expertise and is expensive. These tests are used mainly for prospective parents with a high risk of having a baby with certain genetic disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) or chromosomal abnormalities. However, newer techniques may reduce costs and make the tests more widely available.\nMore Information\nThe following English-language resource may be useful. Please note that THE MANUAL is not responsible for the content of this resource.\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: Genetic Disorders: This website provides definitions of genes and chromosomes and basic information about inheritance, risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and testing for genetic and chromosomal abnormalities.", "In the past, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling was used when rapid chromosome analysis was needed, particularly toward the end of pregnancy when ultrasonography detected abnormalities in the fetus. However, this procedure is now rarely used for this purpose. Instead, doctors analyze the genes in amniotic fluid cells (obtained during amniocentesis), or they analyze part of the placenta (obtained during chorionic villus sampling). These tests are less dangerous and provide results more quickly.\nCurrently, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling is occasionally done when doctors suspect that a fetus has anemia. If the fetus has severe anemia, blood can be transfused to the fetus through the needle while it is still inserted in the umbilical cord.\nPreimplantation Genetic Testing", "Ultrasonography to measure a specific fetal part (such as a fluid-filled space near the back of the fetus\u2019s neck, called fetal nuchal translucency)\nDuring pregnancy, some substances pass from the fetus to the mother and can be tested by doing blood tests on the mother. This includes some fetal DNA. Also, for certain fetal abnormalities, the fetus produces abnormal levels of certain serum markers.\nDoctors usually offer to do blood tests to screen for fetal abnormalities as part of routine prenatal care. However, some prospective parents decide not to have any testing done.\nSometimes prospective parents decide to skip these noninvasive tests and proceed directly to invasive prenatal genetic testing (such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis), especially if the couple is at increased risk of having a baby with a genetic abnormality.", "Through the cervix: The woman lies on her back with her hips and knees bent, usually supported by heel or knee stirrups, as for a pelvic examination. The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through the vagina and cervix into the placenta. For most women, the procedure feels very similar to a Papanicolaou (Pap) test, but a few women find it more uncomfortable.

Such blood may increase the alpha-fetoprotein level, making the results hard to interpret.", "The main advantage of chorionic villus sampling is that its results are available much earlier in the pregnancy than those of amniocentesis. Thus, if no abnormality is detected, the couple\u2019s anxiety can be relieved earlier. If an abnormality is detected earlier and if the couple decides to terminate the pregnancy, simpler, safer methods can be used. Also, early detection of an abnormality may give the couple more time to prepare for the birth of a child with special medical needs.\nBefore chorionic villus sampling, ultrasonography is done to determine whether the fetus is alive, to confirm the length of the pregnancy, to check for obvious abnormalities, and to locate the placenta.\nA sample of the chorionic villi can be removed through the cervix (transcervically) or the abdominal wall (transabdominally).", "Sometimes serum testing is done along with a test that measures fetal nuchal translucency. With this test, doctors use ultrasonography to look at a fluid-filled space near the back of the fetus\u2019s neck.\nTesting for Neural Tube Defects\nThe alpha-fetoprotein level in blood is usually measured in all pregnant women, if other testing did not include this marker (eg, some first-trimester serum marker options, chorionic villus sampling, or amniocentesis). A high level may indicate an increased risk of having\nA baby with a neural tube defect of the brain (such as anencephaly) or spinal cord (such as spina bifida)\nThe alpha-fetoprotein level may also be elevated for other reasons, including\nA baby with a birth defect of the abdominal wall\nLater pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, or a newborn who is small for gestational age (small for how long the pregnancy has lasted), or death of the fetus", "Miscarriage: The chance of miscarriage due to amniocentesis is about 1 in 500 to 1,000.\nNeedle injuries to the fetus: These injuries are very rare.\nAmniocentesis can usually be done when a woman is pregnant with twins or even more fetuses.\nChorionic Villus Sampling\nIn chorionic villus sampling, a doctor removes a small sample of the chorionic villi, which are tiny projections that make up part of the placenta. This procedure is used to diagnose some disorders in the fetus, usually between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nUnlike amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling does not enable doctors to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid. Consequently, doctors cannot measure the alpha-fetoprotein level in amniotic fluid to check for brain and spinal cord defects (neural tube defects).

Remember that a positive screening test tells you only that you are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome or another aneuploidy. A diagnostic test should be done if you want to know a more certain result. Some parents want to know beforehand that their baby will be born with a genetic disorder. This knowledge gives parents time to learn about the disorder and plan for the medical care that the child may need. Some parents may decide to end the pregnancy in certain situations.\nOther parents do not want to know this information before the child is born.

The research methods and technologies used to study fetal brain development and its implications for psychiatric disorders have been rapidly advancing in recent years.

This raises ethical concerns about the use of this information for early interventions and the potential impact on life trajectories for those at risk.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that a better understanding of fetal brain development can lead to early interventions and improved healthcare policies for mental health.

The technique overcomes the biggest problem in functional MRI \u2013 if the subject moves during scanning, the picture is distorted.\nBecause there\u2019s no way to make a squirmy fetus in a mother\u2019s uterus hold still, the researchers developed a method that creates a four-dimensional reconstruction of brain activity.\nLed by Colin Studholme, UW joint professor of pediatrics and bioengineering, the team published its work in two papers last fall in Human Brain Mapping (online August 2016) and Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (online October 2016).", "When using MRI to measure brain function, estimating the intensity of the imaging signal is critical. As part of the brain activates, blood vessels in the area react and supply those brain cells with more oxygen, which causes slight changes in intensity in the MRI image. But if the subject moves, this intensity change can be corrupted and its location in the brain is lost.\n\u201cTo get around some of the motion problems in fetal imaging, we acquire multiple echoes, each from a different perspective, at each location and time point, and then we use those different echoes to calculate a quantitative map of the tissue activity within the brain,\u201d Dr. Studholme says. Using the physical measurements, the team was able to calculate the activation signals over a few minutes, accommodating the baby\u2019s movement.\nThe method allows the mapping of the brain\u2019s default mode network and other regions that are active when the brain is at rest, daydreaming or not concentrating on a specific task.", "\u201cThis research is in its infancy, but it promises to allow us to get a better understanding of what influences brain development and fetal development \u2013 everything from alcohol exposure to stress to diet during pregnancy and how that affects brain development,\u201d Dr. Studholme says. \u201cThere\u2019s a world of new studies that we could be doing. By being able to image babies\u2019 brains before birth, we can begin also to look more accurately at what might cause less common but more extreme clinical cases of abnormal brain development that are challenging to diagnose and treat.\u201d\nThe researchers are looking for additional pregnant volunteers to participate in the fetal imaging studies.

In one project, they are examining the effects of the mother\u2019s diet during pregnancy, specifically looking at protein levels and what might happen if, for example, protein is restricted. In another study, the researchers are looking at the influence of fetal alcohol exposure on fetuses\u2019 developing brains.", "Dr. Studholme is also part of a UW-led team that used different but related motion correction techniques to study the Zika virus in fetal monkey brains.

It could be used to study differences between developing brains in premature and full-term babies. Dr. Studholme and his colleagues Dr. Michael Portman and Dr. Matthew Files at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital are seeking funding to study brain development in babies who have abnormally developing hearts. Babies with heart defects before birth often can have poorer early language skills. \u201cIn these babies with impaired heart development, it appears that the brain, even before birth, is actually developing abnormally, so we\u2019re trying to use these functional imaging techniques to look at brain oxygenation and activity as well as tissue microstructure. We want to see whether we can identify early on which babies are going to have developmental problems, even after their heart defects have been treated, so we can direct early neurodevelopmental interventions after birth.\u201d", "The researchers, from the departments of bioengineering, pediatrics and radiology, now are also imaging structural connectivity of the brain, which Dr. Studholme likens to the brain\u2019s hardware. \u201cNow we\u2019re trying to understand how the wiring inside the brain is being constructed as the software is developing,\u201d he says. The team is studying the fetal brain over 20 weeks, when both brain anatomy and function are changing dramatically. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand how the physical wiring of the brain is being developed and its increasing connectivity, as well as the pruning of connections and how the connections get refined before birth.\u201d\nThe first two papers last fall provided a baseline for healthy brain development.
