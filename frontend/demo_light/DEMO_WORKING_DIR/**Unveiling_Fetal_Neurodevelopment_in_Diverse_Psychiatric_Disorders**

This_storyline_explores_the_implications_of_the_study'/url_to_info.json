These considerations suggest that the transition of DOHaD science from observational studies to those of biological mechanisms will require the integration of genetic information into developmental models. Since vulnerability is seemingly best defined by measures of both environmental risk and genetic predisposition, the inclusion of genetic information is also important for the most precise targeting of interventions.\nClinical Significance\nMaternal mental health and birth outcomes predict child health and development. But are these effects functionally relevant and clinically informative? The impact of maternal emotional well-being on child outcomes has been assessed (\n14,", "These are formidable challenges, and they are not unique to studies of environmental influences occurring during fetal development. However, progress in our understanding of the origins of mental health will depend on our ability to successfully meet the demands of research that focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes at the level of the individual child.", "Research on the fetal origins of individual differences in neurodevelopment has attracted attention to a period of development previously undervalued in importance for later mental health. DOHaD studies provide an empirical basis for multidisciplinary programs across obstetrics/gynecology, neonatology, pediatrics, neuroscience, and psychiatry/psychology and are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the relation between maternal health, fetal growth, and neurodevelopment. This same partnership is critical for clinical programs that target maternal health.", "72), and stratification by genotype yielded effect sizes beyond those commonly reported for studies of birth weight alone. Qiu et al. (\n22) reported that offspring\nCOMT genotype actually determined the nature and regional specificity of the influence of antenatal maternal anxiety on cortical morphology.\nOne approach to examining genetic variation is to compare the moderating influence of the maternal and offspring genotypes. For example, the\nBDNF genotype of the infant, but not that of the mother, moderates the influence of antenatal maternal anxiety on genome-wide DNA methylation (\n21). Indeed, a survey of interindividual variability in DNA methylation across the genome in umbilical cord samples shows that the vast majority (\u223c80%) of such variation is principally determined by an interaction between maternal condition or birth outcome and infant genotype (", "60). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that chronic glucocorticoid treatment during pregnancy reduced fetal growth, but with no discernible effects on neurodevelopment (\n61,\n62). These findings contrast with those described above, and especially noteworthy is the absence of effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment designed to enhance pulmonary maturation compared with treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Importantly, the latter routinely involves treatment in the first trimester, whereas the former targets mid to late pregnancy. The timing of glucocorticoid treatment or exposure over the course of pregnancy, at various stages of neurodevelopment, could potentially explain seemingly conflicting findings (\n63). Nevertheless, in relation to the broader DOHaD hypothesis, it should be noted that a glucocorticoid treatment in later pregnancy that reliably reduces birth weight is not consistently associated with long-term effects on neurodevelopment.", "developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, which suggests that the quality of fetal development shapes individual differences in the risk for chronic illness over the lifespan. The DOHaD theme is familiar in psychiatry/psychology, which emphasizes the importance of early developmental influences as determinants of mental health and human capacity. DOHaD studies reflect the importance of antenatal maternal well-being and fetal growth for individual differences in vulnerability to adverse mental health outcomes, which could inform precision medicine and intervention programs in psychiatry (\n3). We briefly review the evidence for the importance of the antenatal period for neurodevelopment outcomes and suggest challenges for future research, including studies that enable the integration of findings from DOHaD studies into clinical practice and public policy.\nChallenges for DOHaD Models of Mental Health\nThe Term \u201cMaternal Adversity\u201d", "66), suggesting that the well-documented relation between birth weight and cardiometabolic outcomes may partly reflect common underlying genetic features.\nThere has been surprisingly little emphasis on the moderating effect of offspring genotype in studies linking birth weight or maternal stress to neurodevelopment. The consideration of heritable genetic variation is not simply an issue for the interpretation of epidemiological studies. The inclusion of genetics in DOHaD research models provides the opportunity to expand the breadth of research focusing on antenatal environmental influences to discern the degree to which such effects are moderated by offspring genotype. Existing studies reveal that associations between birth weight and child socioemotional development are moderated by variants in multiple genes implicated in serotonergic or dopaminergic function (e.g.,\nTPH2,\nHTR2A,\nSCL6A4, DRD4) (\n70\u2013", "69). High heritability of HPA reactivity is evident among children in families with low adversity, but not in families with high adversity. High familial adversity is associated with greater cortisol reactivity to stress. Since the majority of children enrolled in community-based studies are likely drawn from low-adversity settings, the association between antenatal maternal cortisol and HPA function in the offspring may reflect heritable genetic influences. Moreover, since glucocorticoids are a well-established mechanism for low birth weight, these same considerations might influence the interpretation of associations between birth weight and HPA function. The concern for genetic mediation is underscored by a study showing that among seven confirmed genome-wide loci that account for variance in birth weight, with effects comparable to maternal smoking, three are also associated with cardiovascular (\nADRB1) or metabolic disease (\nADCY5, CDKAL1) (", "82). These findings reveal that the consequences of fetal adversity on child development are dependent on the quality of the postnatal environment.\nIndeed, various forms of prenatal adversity may actually increase the sensitivity of the developing organism to the influences of the postnatal environment (\n83). This \u201cmeta-plasticity\u201d refers not to the influence of antenatal adversity on any specific outcome, but rather to the degree to which the developing organism is susceptible to subsequent environmental influences. The quality of intrauterine environment might explain, in part, the wide diversity among children in the degree to which developmental outcomes are influenced by prevailing context (\n84), a possibility that could inform and improve early interventions strategies.\nIn the studies noted above, the effects of socioeconomic status or maternal care are greater among low compared with normal birth weight offspring (\n27,\n78\u2013", "51). However, these effects are independent of maternal mental health, further underscoring the distinct influences of specific forms of maternal adversity. An extensive review (\n52) reveals an influence of severe stress (e.g., death of a spouse) on offspring birth weight, as well as of factors such as social support that moderate the impact of stress, but no consistent evidence for the influence of maternal anxiety or depression (also see reference\n53). The exceptions are studies showing an association between \u201cpregnancy-associated anxiety\u201d and birth outcomes, which again underscores the specificity of different forms of maternal \u201cadversity.\u201d\nWhile extremely stressful conditions may affect birth outcomes, large epidemiological studies with community samples (e.g.,\n45) have reported no association between maternal levels of depression, anxiety, or stress and either birth weight or gestational age. Likewise, a meta-analysis examining maternal depression and birth weight (", "There is considerable evidence that the influence of intrauterine factors on neurodevelopment is modified by postnatal environmental conditions. Low birth weight predicts adolescent depression more strongly in girls with a history of adverse postnatal experiences, which suggests that the effects of prenatal experiences are conditional on the postnatal environment (\n11). Likewise, the association between birth weight and hippocampal volume is moderated by the quality of parental care (\n27). Socioeconomic status appears to moderate the effects of fetal growth restriction on irritability and impulsivity (\n79). The well-established association between birth weight and ADHD is absent in suburban communities (\n80), suggesting effects that are context dependent, and an enhanced quality of maternal care eliminates the association between birth weight and ADHD symptoms (\n81). Likewise, mother-infant attachment moderates the influence of maternal glucocorticoids on socioemotional development (", "This issue is of considerable importance for the evaluation of treatment outcomes of prevention/intervention programs, as the failure to account for differential vulnerability could underestimate the \u201ctreatment\u201d effect among more vulnerable individuals. These considerations also underscore the importance of longitudinal approaches with sample sizes sufficient to effectively stratify subjects according to risk factors. Such studies might better address the issue of clinical significance, as environmental effects could be evaluated on the basis of adversity in earlier developmental periods.\nConclusions", "Finally, it is difficult to imagine how environmental influences could operate in the absence of genetic moderation. Environmental signals influence brain development and function through effects on intracellular signaling pathways, the activity of which inevitably varies across individuals in part as a result of sequence-based, heritable genetic variation. Thus, the influence of antenatal maternal conditions on neurodevelopment will vary as a function of the genotype of the offspring. Studies that incorporate the analysis of genomic variation may identify gene networks that moderate the impact of antenatal environmental influences and thus elucidate the underlying biological pathways.", "Fetal development clearly matters. Nevertheless, the science of fetal origins of psychopathology faces important challenges. First, current models suffer from the inclusion of multiple antenatal maternal conditions in the broad category of \u201cadversity.\u201d Symptoms of depression or anxiety or responses to stressful circumstances are not synonymous in their underlying biology. Nor do these conditions readily map onto variations in fetal growth.

Screening tests may miss abnormalities or may indicate abnormalities when none are present.\nCell-Free DNA Screening Test\nA common method of screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, is analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the mother's blood, which can be done as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy. For this test, small fragments of the fetus's DNA, which are present in the mother's blood in tiny amounts, are analyzed. Detection rates using this technology are higher than most other noninvasive methods.\nSerum Marker Screening Test", "If pregnancy is to be achieved using in vitro (test tube) fertilization, doctors can sometimes diagnose genetic disorders in the embryo before it is transferred to the woman\u2019s uterus. Preimplantation genetic testing requires technical expertise and is expensive. These tests are used mainly for prospective parents with a high risk of having a baby with certain genetic disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) or chromosomal abnormalities.

Maternal factors such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), high BMI and age in the mother were not significantly associated with Q-CHAT score in the child.

The Q-CHAT is not specific to or diagnostic of autism, but rather captures a wider spectrum of early neurodevelopmental traits. Similarly, there was no observed sex difference in autistic traits at 18\u201320 months of age, which could be attributed to a smaller sample size compared with previous studies or that effect sizes related to sex differences have been small ", "Prenatal brain growth is associated with toddler autistic traits and this can be ascertained via ultrasound starting at 20 weeks gestation.\nBackground\nApproximately four weeks after conception, the formation of the cerebral hemispheres can be observed , with spontaneous movements of the head and trunk being seen from as early as 9 weeks\u2019 gestation age (GA) .

Specifically, we found that a larger TCD as early as week 20 is associated with autistic traits in both males and females at 18\u201320 months. This finding further supports the potential inclusion of prenatal TCD as an early marker of later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The observed positive relationship between prenatal TCD size at 20 weeks\u2019 gestation and Q-CHAT score at 18\u201320 months could be introduced into early postnatal screening as a potential early marker for autism. In the future this could aid with early diagnosis and therefore could improve access to interventions and/or support early in development for those that want these services. However further longitudinal exploration is needed to validate this potential early marker, as well as its specificity to autistic traits", "A total of 219 fetuses (104 males and 115 females) from neurotypical healthy pregnancies were recruited prospectively from the Rosie Hospital Cambridge, UK (Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).

Fetal biometrics are used to predict which newborn infants may be at risk for low birth weight due to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or are small or large for gestation age (SGA, LGA). These biometrics are predictors of adverse fetal and infant outcomes. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between deviation in fetal growth (e.g., SGA, LGA) and birth weight, with mixed findings for later child outcomes (e.g., increased likelihood of developing sensory issues , autism  and increased incidence of cognitive disabilities ). However, most research examining the relationship between the prenatal period and later outcomes has only measured pregnancy outcomes or overall growth (e.g., birthweight, IUGR and LGA), with few studies measuring the longitudinal relationship between fetal growth and development of outcomes in infancy.", ".
