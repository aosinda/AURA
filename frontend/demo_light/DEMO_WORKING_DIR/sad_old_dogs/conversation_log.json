This can lead to changes in their behavior, such as disorientation and confusion. Adapting the sustained gaze test, used in laboratory settings, for use at home can help detect CDS earlier and provide appropriate care for aging dogs.\n\nSome common signs of aging in dogs may include cloudy eyes, difficulty seeing, and changes in behavior [4].

As they age, our furry friends go through many physical and emotional changes, just like humans. It is important for us as pet owners to be aware of these changes and to provide the best care and support for our senior pups.\n\nAccording to [1], one of the most common signs of emotional distress in older dogs is withdrawal and sadness. Just like humans, dogs can become stressed and depressed if they are experiencing emotional turmoil for a prolonged period of time. As responsible pet owners, it is important for us to monitor our dog's behavior and seek help from a veterinarian if necessary.\n\n[2] also mentions that it can be difficult to read our dog's emotions because they cannot communicate with words. However, we can observe their body language and behavior to get a sense of their mood. Some other signs of emotional distress in older dogs include decreased appetite, increased sleep, and a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed.\n\nIn [5], it is highlighted that as dogs age, they become more susceptible to certain diseases and health conditions. These can also have an impact on their emotional well-being. Regular veterinary checkups can help to detect and manage these conditions, keeping your older dog comfortable and happy.\n\nAccording to [6], as dogs age, they may experience changes in their cognitive function, just like humans. This can affect their memory, awareness, and ability to learn. As pet owners, we need to be their advocates and monitor their behavior for any changes so we can provide the best care for them.\n\nIn [7], it is mentioned that dogs age at different rates depending on their breed and size. Smaller breeds, like Chihuahuas, may not be considered old until they are 7 to 10 years old. It is important to be aware of the signs of aging in dogs so we can help them age gracefully.\n\nLastly, [8] and [9] emphasize the importance of our role as pet owners in the emotional well-being of our dogs. Changes in their environment, routine, or family dynamics can cause stress, anxiety, and even depression in our furry companions.

These studies have found that as dogs age, they may experience changes in their behavior and mood, similar to how humans experience changes in their mental health as they age.\n\nOne study, published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior, found that 74.3% of dogs aged 10 years or older showed at least one sign of cognitive dysfunction, including depression-like behavior such as decreased activity and social interactions [2]. Another study, published in Animals, found that older dogs were more likely to have behavioral changes such as aggression and fearfulness, which can also be signs of depression [3].\n\nBut how do we know if a dog is truly experiencing depression or sadness? According to Dr. Jennifer Coates, a veterinarian and author, changes in a dog's normal behavior can be a sign of depression. For example, if a dog who used to love playing suddenly loses interest in their favorite activities, this could be a sign of depression [5].\n\nBut can dogs really experience emotions like sadness and depression? According to research conducted by Dr. Gregory Burns, a neuroscientist at Emory University, the answer is yes. Dr. Burns has found that certain areas of the canine brain are activated during emotions such as happiness and sadness, similar to how these areas are activated in humans [6].\n\nIn terms of treatment, it's important to first rule out any underlying medical issues that could be causing changes in behavior. If a dog is experiencing depression, it's important for their owner to provide love and support, as well as engage them in activities they enjoy [7].\n\nInterestingly, research has also found that pet ownership, particularly dog ownership, can have a positive impact on mental health. A study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that pet owners, especially those with severe levels of mental health symptoms, were less likely to experience depression and anxiety during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic [8]. Another study found that having a dog as a companion can reduce depression in older adults [9].\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact prevalence of depression and sadness in older dogs is not known, research has shown that these emotions can be experienced by our canine companions.
