Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson's in the general population.\nConversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson's with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don't have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analyzing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people.", "Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson's disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that influence the risk of developing Parkinson's, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease.\nMore patients and families participating in genetic research are needed to find additional components of the engine behind Parkinson's. Each person's genome has about 27 million variants of the 6 billion building blocks that make up their genes. There are many more genetic components for Parkinson's that have yet to be found.\nAs our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson's.", "Parkinson's disease genes\nUsing linkage analysis, my team and I identified a new genetic mutation for Parkinson's disease called RAB32 Ser71Arg.

This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify.\nWith further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson's disease.

It gradually impairs a person's ability to function until they ultimately become immobile and often develop dementia. In the U.S. alone, over a million people are afflicted with Parkinson's, and new cases and overall numbers are steadily increasing.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease.\nHowever, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \"linked\" and \"associated\" discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson's. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson's? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "There is currently no treatment to slow or halt Parkinson's disease. Available drugs don't slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson's, it's improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.\nMany factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson's, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson's aren't inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.", "Nevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson's disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson's that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations\nIn the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson's might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson's: linkage analysis and association studies.", "While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell's trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell's immune system recognizes as \"self\" rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson's is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease. Like the owner's manual to your car's engine, it provides a practical guide of what to check when the motor fails.", "Linkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson's, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson's appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.\n\"Linkage\" between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes.", "Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is lost in Parkinson's as the cells that produce it progressively die. Together, these linked genes and the proteins they encode regulate specialized autophagy processes. In addition, these encoded proteins enable immunity within cells.\nSuch linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson's in later life.\nRAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries.

Around 1,500 years ago, about eight percent of people living in Spain were of Jewish descent. Within a couple of hundred years, the Jewish population split, with the Ashkenazi group settling in Germany, France, and Eastern Europe and speaking Yiddish. Meanwhile, the Iberian-Arab Jews, later known as the Sephardic Jews, moved to and from North Africa to Spain and Portugal over the next hundreds of years.", "\u201cThe fact that the LRRK2 G2019S variant is found in North African Arabs, Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, and populations in Latin America and the Caribbean tells a story of our shared genetic roots,\u201d said Lucy Norcliffe-Kaufmann, Ph.D., Principal Scientist with 23andMe\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s Disease Research program.\nThe Founder Mutation\nStudying specific genes, like LRRK2, can teach us much.

A founder mutation refers to genetic variants arising from a population\u2019s loss of genetic variation. This happens when a distinctive population emerges from a small number of people isolated by geography or culture for a considerable time.\nThe isolation of small populations can result in a higher-than-average frequency for specific genetic variants within that population.", "Loss of smell, another common symptom of Parkinson\u2019s, is also less common in those with the LRRK2 variant. This is important because when we look for people with early Parkinson\u2019s disease, we ask about loss of smell and RBD to determine whether there are early signs of neurodegeneration in the brain. We might be underestimating the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease in someone with the LRRK2 variant because they are less likely to have sleep and smell problems.", "\u201cThis explains why the variant can be harbored in a community and flourish in subsequent generations, particularly in communities that remain isolated by persecution or geography,\u201d Lucy said.\nThese differences beg many questions, but they also offer potential avenues of inquiry that could give researchers insights into how to treat different types of Parkinson\u2019s disease better. The majority of Parkinson\u2019s cases do not have a known cause, but in the case of LRRK2, because the association is known, knowing that you have the variant sooner can lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes.\nTo develop new therapies, scientists need to learn more about who is at risk, why, and the earliest signs of the disease.\nThe Origins of LRRK2 Variant\nBeyond that, tracing where and when the LRRK2 G2019S founder mutation originated offers other opportunities to find carriers in diverse populations and build community among those people.", "Understanding this history and the significance of a person\u2019s ancestry related to the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and its link to a higher risk for Parkinson\u2019s disease allows researchers to build awareness within these communities.\nThis, in turn, may help improve how we screen for the disease and how to build a broader community around this specific type of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThe LRRK2 study, known as our Parkinson\u2019s Impact Project, or PIP, has already produced tremendous insights into the disease. It helps scientists better understand the progression of Parkinson\u2019s and how LRRK2 PD differs from idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s, for which there is no known cause.\nThis study is just one of many aspects of 23andMe\u2019s long-standing commitment to studying Parkinson\u2019s, the second most common neurodegenerative condition behind Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "For example, over generations, the geographic isolation of Finnish people led to a founder mutation that puts them at a higher risk for a kidney condition known as congenital nephrotic syndrome. The isolation of French Canadians in Quebec offers another example. That isolation led to a founder mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that puts them at higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer.\nSome of the most well-known founder mutations are among people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Isolated over time by culture, religion, and, in some cases, geography led to higher incidences of specific genetic variants within Ashkenazi populations. These genetic variants put them at higher genetic risk for breast and ovarian cancer.\nBut people of Ashkenazi ancestry are also more likely to have the LRRK2 G2019S founder mutation that puts them at more risk for a specific type of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nLRRK2-Associated Parkinson\u2019s", "Why is LRRK2 also found in higher frequency in North Africa and parts of Spain, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and Puerto Rico? That latter finding for a higher frequency of people in the Latin Caribbean community with higher rates of this variant is a new finding from this research by 23andMe, and it begs the question of why we see those higher rates.\nThe answer lies in the unique history of people of Jewish ancestry, shaped by trade routes around the Mediterranean and historical events like the Muslim Arab expansion, the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the colonization and migration into the Americas.\nTracing LRRK2\nScientists believe the LRRK2 founder mutation originated in the Berber populations of North Africa and then passed through the Maghrebi into the Jewish communities that arrived there, having fled the Roman invasions of Jerusalem.", "Looking specifically at LRRK2 G2019S, the variant doesn\u2019t just convey an increased risk for Parkinson\u2019s. People who develop the disease who have the variant also have different types of symptoms than others with Parkinson\u2019s but who do not have the LRRK2 variant.\n23andMe researchers recently published data in Brain, that looks at some of those differences.\nPeople with LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease, with symptoms more related to motor dysfunction. People with this LRRK2 variant also have lower rates of REM sleep behavior disorder or RBD, which is a common symptom of Parkinson\u2019s, particularly in the early stages. RBD includes sleep interrupted by acting out dreams and is much more common in people with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, or Parkinson\u2019s, in which the cause is unknown.\nDifferent Types of Symptoms", "Using data from 23andMe research participants who consented to participate in this research, 23andMe scientists plotted on a map where those with the LRRK2 variant trace their ancestry.\nThe maps note the fingerprints of that migration history with the highest concentrations for the mutation in people with genetic ancestry from North Africa, Eastern Europe, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and parts of South America.\n\u201cThe fact that we see the LRRK2 G2019S variant signal in the Caribbean maps fits with the history of the Jewish Conquistadors who sailed with Columbus on his voyages to the New World,\u201d said Lucy.\nWe also see strong signals in Brazil, one of the first South American countries to allow Jewish people to live and practice freely.\n\u201c(The finding) extends beyond the classic assumption that LRRK2 PD occurs in North African Berbers and the Ashkenazi Jews,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cIt is an example of how mutations migrate and can spring up in new founding communities.\u201d\n23andMe\u2019s Ongoing Parkinson\u2019s Research", "23andMe researchers have studied the genetic underpinnings of Parkinson\u2019s disease since 2009.

This report is included in the 23andMe Health + Ancestry Service.\nNote", "In addition, people with LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s have fewer cognitive issues and seem to be at a lower risk for developing dementia. This suggests that the LRRK2 variant leads to a slowly primarily progressive motor form of Parkinson\u2019s disease, in which the neurodegenerative process appears to be restricted to areas of the brain that control movement. The data suggests that in LRRK2 Parkinson\u2019s disease, the areas outside the motor control regions are spared from the neurodegenerative process, so we see fewer autonomic, cognitive, sleep, and smell issues in carriers that develop the disease.\nThe researchers point out that it\u2019s unusual to see a dominant mutation like LRRK2 so prevalent across different communities, but that may be partly because of the later onset of LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s. Symptoms tend to show when people are in their 60s and well past reproductive years.", "Looking at the history of the LRRK2 founder mutation also offers insight into human migration and some of the people most impacted by it. One of the novel findings of this study is the identification of \u201chotspots\u201d of people from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil who carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation at higher rates.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target.

Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, and PKC can modulate the rate at which the transporter moves dopamine or cause the internalization of DAT. Co-localized TAAR1 is an important regulator of the dopamine transporter that, when activated, phosphorylates DAT through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization (non-competitive reuptake inhibition), but PKC-mediated phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine efflux). Dopamine autoreceptors also regulate DAT by directly opposing the effect of TAAR1 activation.", "In a study performed by Sommer et al. (2014), healthy rats treated with the selective dopamine transport (DAT) inhibitor MRZ-9547 (Fig. 1) chose high effort, high reward more often than their untreated matched controls.

As a result of DAT\u2013Cav coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release.\nProtein structure", "- ^ Torres GE, Gainetdinov RR, Caron MG (January 2003). \"Plasma membrane monoamine transporters: structure, regulation and function\".

In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to TAAR1 or enters synaptic vesicles through VMAT2. When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKII\u03b1-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine.", "Staining in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the mesolimbic pathway was dense and heterogeneous. In the striatum, DAT is localized in the plasma membrane of axon terminals. Double immunocytochemistry demonstrated DAT colocalization with two other markers of nigrostriatal terminals, tyrosine hydroxylase and D2 dopamine receptors. The latter was thus demonstrated to be an autoreceptor on cells that release dopamine. TAAR1 is a presynaptic intracellular receptor that is also colocalized with DAT and which has the opposite effect of the D2 autoreceptor when activated; i.e., it internalizes dopamine transporters and induces efflux through reversed transporter function via PKA and PKC signaling.\nSurprisingly, DAT was not identified within any synaptic active zones. These results suggest that striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of synaptic specializations once dopamine diffuses from the synaptic cleft.", "The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. In contrast, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) do not contain zinc binding sites. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nBiological role and disorders\n[edit]The rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell. This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters. These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of ADHD.", "[edit]DAT is a symporter that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and co-transport of two Na+ ions and one Cl\u2212 ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase.\nIn the most widely accepted model for monoamine transporter function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane.", "- ^ Salamone JD, Correa M, Ferrigno S, Yang JH, Rotolo RA, Presby RE (October 2018). \"The Psychopharmacology of Effort-Related Decision Making: Dopamine, Adenosine, and Insights into the Neurochemistry of Motivation\".

The research suggests that this single genetic variant could have a significant impact on dopamine regulation and crucial brain functions related to movement and mood.\n\nSymptoms and clinical manifestations observed in patients with the DAT-K619N mutation have been reported to vary depending on the disorder they are experiencing. For instance, in early-onset parkinsonism, patients may experience tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement. In ADHD, symptoms may include hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. In bipolar disorder and depression, symptoms may include mood swings, changes in energy levels, and difficulty with emotional regulation.\n\nIt is essential to note that while this discovery holds promise for earlier diagnosis and potentially new treatments for these conditions, there are also ethical considerations to be discussed.

This protein, coded for by the SLC6A3 gene, pumps dopamine out of the synapse and back into the cytosol where it can be recycled and used again.

In the cytosol, other transporters sequester the dopamine into vesicles for storage and later release. Dopamine reuptake via DAT provides the primary mechanism through which dopamine is cleared from synapses, although there may be an exception in the prefrontal cortex, where evidence points to a possibly larger role of the norepinephrine transporter.", "DAT is implicated in a number of dopamine-related disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, eating disorders, and substance use disorders. The gene that encodes the DAT protein is located on chromosome 5, consists of 15 coding exons, and is roughly 64 kbp long. Evidence for the associations between DAT and dopamine related disorders has come from a type of genetic polymorphism, known as a variable number tandem repeat, in the SLC6A3 gene, which influences the amount of protein expressed.\nFunction\n[edit]DAT is an integral membrane protein that removes dopamine from the synaptic cleft and deposits it into surrounding cells, thus terminating the signal of the neurotransmitter. Dopamine underlies several aspects of cognition, including reward, and DAT facilitates regulation of that signal.\nMechanism", "[edit]DAT is a symporter that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and co-transport of two Na+ ions and one Cl\u2212 ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase.\nIn the most widely accepted model for monoamine transporter function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane.", "Studies using electrophysiology and radioactive-labeled dopamine have confirmed that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane with one or two sodium ions. Chloride ions are also needed to prevent a buildup of positive charge. These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient.\nBecause of the tight coupling of the membrane potential and the sodium gradient, activity-induced changes in membrane polarity can dramatically influence transport rates. In addition, the transporter may contribute to dopamine release when the neuron depolarizes.\nDAT\u2013Cav coupling", "[edit]Preliminary evidence suggests that the dopamine transporter couples to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (particularly Cav1.2 and Cav1.3), which are expressed in virtually all dopamine neurons. As a result of DAT\u2013Cav coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release.\nProtein structure", "[edit]The initial determination of the membrane topology of DAT was based upon hydrophobic sequence analysis and sequence similarities with the GABA transporter. These methods predicted twelve transmembrane domains (TMD) with a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth TMDs. Further characterization of this protein used proteases, which digest proteins into smaller fragments, and glycosylation, which occurs only on extracellular loops, and largely verified the initial predictions of membrane topology. The exact structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter (dDAT) was elucidated in 2013 by X-ray crystallography.\nLocation and distribution\n[edit]", "Regional distribution of DAT has been found in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry, including the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. The nuclei that make up these pathways have distinct patterns of expression. Gene expression patterns in the adult mouse show high expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta.\nDAT in the mesocortical pathway, labeled with radioactive antibodies, was found to be enriched in dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. This pattern makes sense for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the synapse.", "Staining in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the mesolimbic pathway was dense and heterogeneous. In the striatum, DAT is localized in the plasma membrane of axon terminals. Double immunocytochemistry demonstrated DAT colocalization with two other markers of nigrostriatal terminals, tyrosine hydroxylase and D2 dopamine receptors. The latter was thus demonstrated to be an autoreceptor on cells that release dopamine. TAAR1 is a presynaptic intracellular receptor that is also colocalized with DAT and which has the opposite effect of the D2 autoreceptor when activated; i.e., it internalizes dopamine transporters and induces efflux through reversed transporter function via PKA and PKC signaling.\nSurprisingly, DAT was not identified within any synaptic active zones. These results suggest that striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of synaptic specializations once dopamine diffuses from the synaptic cleft.", "In the substantia nigra, DAT is localized to axonal and dendritic (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes.\nWithin the perikarya of pars compacta neurons, DAT was localized primarily to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation.\nGenetics and regulation\n[edit]The gene for DAT, known as DAT1, is located on chromosome 5p15. The protein encoding region of the gene is over 64 kb long and comprises 15 coding segments or exons. This gene has a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the 3\u2019 end (rs28363170) and another in the intron 8 region. Differences in the VNTR have been shown to affect the basal level of expression of the transporter; consequently, researchers have looked for associations with dopamine-related disorders.", "Nurr1, a nuclear receptor that regulates many dopamine-related genes, can bind the promoter region of this gene and induce expression. This promoter may also be the target of the transcription factor Sp-1.", "While transcription factors control which cells express DAT, functional regulation of this protein is largely accomplished by kinases. MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, and PKC can modulate the rate at which the transporter moves dopamine or cause the internalization of DAT. Co-localized TAAR1 is an important regulator of the dopamine transporter that, when activated, phosphorylates DAT through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization (non-competitive reuptake inhibition), but PKC-mediated phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine efflux). Dopamine autoreceptors also regulate DAT by directly opposing the effect of TAAR1 activation.", "The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. In contrast, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) do not contain zinc binding sites. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nBiological role and disorders\n[edit]The rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell. This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters. These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of ADHD.", "Differences in the functional VNTR have been identified as risk factors for bipolar disorder and ADHD. Data has emerged that suggests there is also an association with stronger withdrawal symptoms from alcoholism, although this is a point of controversy. An allele of the DAT gene with normal protein levels is associated with non-smoking behavior and ease of quitting. Additionally, male adolescents particularly those in high-risk families (ones marked by a disengaged mother and absence of maternal affection) who carry the 10-allele VNTR repeat show a statistically significant affinity for antisocial peers.\nIncreased activity of DAT is associated with several different disorders, including clinical depression.\nMutations in DAT have been shown to cause dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, an autosomal recessive movement disorder characterized by progressively worsening dystonia and parkinsonism.\nPharmacology", "[edit]The dopamine transporter is the target of substrates, dopamine releasers, transport inhibitors and allosteric modulators.", "Cocaine blocks DAT by binding directly to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport. In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to TAAR1 or enters synaptic vesicles through VMAT2. When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKII\u03b1-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine.", "The dopaminergic mechanisms of each drug are believed to underlie the pleasurable feelings elicited by these substances.\nInteractions\n[edit]Dopamine transporter has been shown to interact with:\nApart from these innate protein-protein interactions, recent studies demonstrated that viral proteins such as HIV-1 Tat protein interacts with the DAT and this binding may alter the dopamine homeostasis in HIV positive individuals which is a contributing factor for the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.\nLigands and modulators\n[edit]Substrates\n[edit]- Dopamine\n- Norepinephrine\n- Substrate-type dopamine releasing agents (e.g., amphetamine)\n- Certain dopaminergic neurotoxins (e.g., MPTP, 6-OHDA)\nDopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs)\n[edit]Typical or classical cocaine-like blockers\n[edit]- Amfonelic acid\n- BTCP\n- Cocaine\n- JJC8-088\n- Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV)\n- Methylphenidate", "- Orphenadrine\n- Pipradrol\n- RTI-55\n- Troparil (WIN-35065)\n- WIN-35428 (\u03b2-CFT)\nThese agents may actually act as dopamine releasing agent-esque DAT negative allosteric modulators or \"inverse agonists\".\nAtypical non-psychostimulant blockers\n[edit]- (S)-MK-26\n- Armodafinil\n- Benztropine\n- Bupropion (but some potential for cocaine-like actions)\n- GBR-12935\n- JHW-007\n- Mazindol\n- Modafinil\n- MRZ-9547 ((R)-phenylpiracetam)\n- Nomifensine\n- RDS03-94\n- Rimcazole\n- Sibutramine\n- Solriamfetol\n- Tamoxifen\n- Tesofensine\n- Vanoxerine (GBR-12909)\nThese agents may actually act as simple competitive DAT blockers with releaser-esque \"inverse agonist\" activity.\nUnsorted blockers\n[edit]Dopamine releasing agents (DRAs)\n[edit]- 2-Aminoindane (2-AI)\n- 5-Chloro-\u03b1MT", "- \u03b1-Ethyltryptamine (\u03b1ET)\n- \u03b1-Methyltryptamine (\u03b1MT)\n- Aminorex\n- Amphetamine (both dextro- and levoamphetamine)\n- Benzylpiperazine (BZP)\n- Cathine\n- Cathinone\n- Ephedrine\n- Lisdexamfetamine (LDX)\n- Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA)\n- Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA)\n- Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)\n- Mephedrone\n- Methamphetamine\n- Methylone\n- Naphthylisopropylamine (PAL-287)\n- Octopamine\n- Pemoline\n- Phenethylamine\n- Phenmetrazine\n- Phentermine\n- Phenylpropanolamine (PPA)\n- Pseudoephedrine\n- Tryptamine\n- Tyramine\nThese agents are also known as substrate-type dopamine releasing agents and as DAT reversers.\nAllosteric modulators\n[edit]Positive allosteric modulators\n[edit]- Apigenin\n- Luteolin\n- SoRI-9804 (SRI-9804)", "- SoRI-20040 (SRI-20040)\nNegative allosteric modulators\n[edit]- Ibogaine\n- KM822\n- Mesocarb (Sydnocarb)\n- MRS7292\n- SoRI-20041 (SRI-20041)\n- SRI-29574\n- SRI-31142\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b c ENSG00000276996 GRCh38: Ensembl release 89: ENSG00000142319, ENSG00000276996 \u2013 Ensembl, May 2017\n- ^ a b c GRCm38: Ensembl release 89: ENSMUSG00000021609 \u2013 Ensembl, May 2017\n- ^ \"Human PubMed Reference:\".

Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter for several brain functions including locomotor control and reward systems. The transporter structure, function, mechanism of action, localization, and distribution, in addition to gene regulation, are discussed. Over many years, a wealth of information concerning the DAT has been accrued and has led to increased interest in the role of the DAT in a plethora of central nervous system diseases. These DAT characteristics are explored in relation to a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, with a particular focus on the genetics of the DAT. In addition, we discuss the pharmacology of the DAT and how this relates to disease and addiction.\nKeywords: ADHD; Addiction; Borderline; Dopamine; Genetics; Neurotransmitter; Parkinson\u2019s; Polymorphism; Transporter; VNTR.", "\u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee a health care professional if you have any of the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease \u2014 not only to diagnose your condition but also to rule out other causes for your symptoms.\nCauses", "Parkinson's disease is often accompanied by these additional problems, which may be treatable:\n- Thinking difficulties. You may experience cognitive problems, such as dementia, and thinking difficulties. These usually occur in the later stages of Parkinson's disease. Such cognitive problems aren't usually helped by medicines.\n-\nDepression and emotional changes. You may experience depression, sometimes in the very early stages. Receiving treatment for depression can make it easier to handle the other challenges of Parkinson's disease.\nYou also may experience other emotional changes, such as fear, anxiety or loss of motivation. Your health care team may give you medicine to treat these symptoms.\n- Swallowing problems. You may develop difficulties with swallowing as your condition progresses. Saliva may accumulate in your mouth due to slowed swallowing, leading to drooling.", "- Smell dysfunction. You may experience problems with your sense of smell. You may have trouble identifying certain odors or the difference between odors.\n- Fatigue. Many people with Parkinson's disease lose energy and experience fatigue, especially later in the day. The cause isn't always known.\n- Pain. Some people with Parkinson's disease experience pain, either in specific areas of their bodies or throughout their bodies.\n- Sexual dysfunction. Some people with Parkinson's disease notice a decrease in sexual desire or performance.\nPrevention\nBecause the cause of Parkinson's is unknown, there are no proven ways to prevent the disease.\nSome research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease.", "- Environmental triggers. Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.\nResearchers also have noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. These changes include:\n- The presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.", "- Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe that an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein, also called a-synuclein. It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. Researchers have found the clumped alpha-synuclein protein in the spinal fluid of people who later develop Parkinson's disease.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for Parkinson's disease include:", "Some other research has shown that people who consume caffeine \u2014 which is found in coffee, tea and cola \u2014 get Parkinson's disease less often than those who don't drink it. Green tea also is related to a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, it is still not known whether caffeine protects against getting Parkinson's or is related in some other way. Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that drinking caffeinated beverages protects against Parkinson's.", "- Age. Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older. If a young person does have Parkinson's disease, genetic counseling might be helpful in making family planning decisions. Work, social situations and medicine side effects are also different from those of an older person with Parkinson's disease and require special considerations.\n- Heredity. Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that you'll develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives in your family with Parkinson's disease.\n- Sex. Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women.\n- Exposure to toxins. Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinson's disease.\nComplications", "In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells called neurons in the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes irregular brain activity, leading to problems with movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nThe cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including:\n-\nGenes. Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease.\nHowever, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers.", "Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. Early symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides.\nParkinson's symptoms may include:\n- Tremor. Rhythmic shaking, called tremor, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks.\n- Slowed movement, known as bradykinesia. Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk.\n- Rigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.", "Overview\nParkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also may cause stiffness or slowing of movement.\nIn the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.\nAlthough Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines might significantly improve your symptoms.

Although this task initially seemed straightforward, they soon discovered why the question had not been answered before: genomic and epidemiological studies do not use a common naming system for the various cancers. For example, some researchers classified cancers by location on the body while others grouped them by tumor type, and many used a combination of the two. This made it difficult to align the data sets, which was critical for determining how common the different mutations were.", "\u201cThe paper answers a very basic question: what are the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer?\u201d says Stites, who is also a physician as well as holder of the Hearst Foundation Developmental Chair. \u201cSurprisingly, this question had not been answered.\u201d\nGenetic mutations play a fundamental role in the development and growth of cancers.

However, while many studies have identified the mutations involved in certain cancers, like breast cancer or lymphoma, no one had ever managed to combine the data in a way that could reveal which mutations are most common in the entire cancer patient population. Every cancer is different, and this makes it challenging to determine which cancer-causing genes and which drug targets should be prioritized for further study.", "To overcome the challenge, the scientists carefully analyzed more than 200 studies and individually reviewed and reclassified each cancer according to a consistent naming system. They then compared the data sets, taking into account the fact that some cancers are more common than others. When they analyzed the data, they found that some widespread beliefs were incorrect. For example, KRAS is an important cancer-promoting gene that was believed to be mutated in 25% of all cancers; rather, it was found to be involved in only about 11% of all cancers.

The tests wouldn\u2019t clarify their cancer risks and therefore wouldn\u2019t change the way their doctors are already managing their medical care. Instead, medical decisions should be based on their personal or family history of cancer.\nThat being said, there are times when multiple members in a family affected by cancer are tested to determine whether the same variant is present in those with cancer, or absent in those without. Your genetic counselor will notify you if testing other family members will help classify your variant.\nHow does my VUS change my medical treatment?\nIt doesn\u2019t.

A recent study found that 91% of reclassified variants were downgraded to \u201cbenign,\u201d while only 9% were upgraded to pathogenic.\nReclassifying a VUS can take months, years or decades. Some may never be reclassified if labs don\u2019t have enough data to draw a definitive conclusion.\nHas our knowledge about variants changed over time?", "Researchers used to believe that all genetic variants were largely harmful. But about 20 years ago when the first sequences of the human genome were published, scientists realized that instead of being rarities that almost invariably harm health, variants occur frequently throughout the human genome. The average human carries around 400 unique variants, and most of us are none the worse because of them.\nHow will I know when my VUS has been reclassified?\nWhen a VUS is reclassified, the laboratory that performed your test sends a revised report to your genetic counselor, explaining how and why the variant was reclassified. Your genetic counselor then contacts you to explain the updated results and what they mean for you and your family. For this reason, it\u2019s very important for MD Anderson patients to keep their mailing address, email address and phone number up-to-date in MyChart.\nIf I have a variant of uncertain significance, should my family members be tested?", "Increased screenings or a surgery such as a preventive mastectomy could be unnecessary and potentially harmful to patients whose variants are later discovered to be benign.

They\u2019re relieved to know no known pathogenic variants were detected. A few, however, find the ambiguous results unnerving. They have trouble coping with the uncertainty of a VUS.", "Before patients undergo genetic testing, we counsel them about the risks and limitations of testing. If they\u2019re particularly anxious, we may suggest they forgo testing altogether, or test fewer genes to lessen the chance of finding a VUS.

But even with the right genetic counseling, uncertainty can be difficult.\nHow can scientists learn more about variants of uncertain significance?\nTo get a handle on a variant\u2019s role in cancer, researchers must test millions of people, and share their data. If a VUS is found in a significant number of people who have cancer, but absent in those who don\u2019t, there\u2019s an increased likelihood that it could be associated with higher cancer risks.\nBut regardless of how extensive the databases get and how many people undergo genetic testing, uncertainty will never completely go away.

Image Credit: ClareM / Shutterstock\nA recent study published in the journal Nature revealed new insights into the genetic links between de novo mutation (DNM) rates, ovarian aging, and cancer risk.\nFemale reproductive longevity varies substantially and profoundly affects health and fertility in later life. Females have a non-renewable ovarian reserve established during fetal development, which depletes continuously throughout the reproductive life, leading to menopause. Menopause timing varies based on the differences in the initial oocyte pool size and follicle loss rate.", "Further, novel rare variants were identified in SAM and HD domain-containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 8 (PNPLA8), zinc finger protein 518A (ZNF518A), and ETAA1 activator of ATR kinase (ETAA1). The effect sizes ranged between 5.61 years earlier ANM for ZNF518A HC-PTV carriers and 1.35 years later ANM for SAMHD1 damaging variant carriers.\nNext, the team integrated these exome-wide results with the largest common variant GWAS of ANM. Five of the nine ANM genes (CHEK2, HELB, ETAA1, ZNF518A, and BRCA2) were mapped within 500 kb of a common GWAS signal. Three non-coding common GWAS signals were proximal to ZNF518A. Further, the researchers showed that common ANM-associated variants were enriched in ZNF518A binding sites.", "Finally, the team tested whether the genetic susceptibility to earlier ovarian aging increased the DNM rate in the offspring. As such, they analyzed parent-offspring trios from the 100,000 Genome Project and computed a polygenic score for ANM in the parents. They noted that the maternal genetic susceptibility to earlier ANM was linked to a higher rate of maternally derived DNMs in the offspring. However, this association was not replicated in an independent cohort, underscoring the need for further investigation.\nConclusions\nTogether, the study identified nine ANM genes, increasing the number of genes implicated in ovarian aging by identifying rare protein-coding variants. Effect sizes ranged from 5.61 years earlier to 1.35 years later ANM compared to the maximum effect size of 1.06 years reported for common variants. Deleterious variants in SAMHD1, CHEK2, and HELB were associated with increased ANM. Seven ANM genes are known to be involved in DNA damage repair.", "Enrichment of GWAS signals at ZNF518A binding sites suggests that ZNF518A regulates genes related to reproductive longevity by repressing regulatory elements distal to the transcription initiation sites. Females carrying rare PTVs in ZNF518A have shorter reproductive lifespans due to delayed puberty and earlier menopause.\nDamaging variants in SAMHD1 were associated with an increased all-cancer risk in males and females, hormone-sensitive cancers in females, and prostate cancer in males. While the team noted that maternal genetic susceptibility to earlier ANM was associated with a higher DNM rate in offspring, they caution that this association was not replicated in an independent cohort. Future large-scale studies will be necessary to explore this relationship further and confirm the findings..", "In this new study, researchers investigate the role of rare damaging variants in ovarian aging. They used WES data of 106,974 postmenopausal female participants in the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank and performed individual gene burden association tests. Rare exome variants were classified into three categories: 1) missense variants, 2) high-confidence protein-truncating variants (HC-PTVs), and 3) damaging variants (combination of HC-PTVs and missense variants).\nThe team identified rare variants in nine genes associated with ANM, three of which (BRCA2, HELB, and CHEK2) were reported in prior UK Biobank WES analyses. They corroborated the associations of CHEK2 and HELB with 1.57 and 1.84 years later ANM, respectively, and the previously borderline association of homologous recombination factor with OB-fold (HROB) with 2.89 years earlier ANM. Interestingly, carriers of BRCA2 HC-PTV were found to have 1.18 years earlier ANM.", "The largest GWAS for age at menarche revealed a common variant at ZNF518A for later puberty in females. Supporting this finding, the researchers observed that ZNF518A PTVs were also associated with later age at menarche. In addition, common variants related to puberty in females were enriched in transcriptional targets of ZNF518A.\nNext, the researchers investigated the effects of genes associated with ANM on cancer outcomes. Their analysis consistently replicated reported associations between PTVs in PALB2, BRCA2, and CHEK2 and cancer outcomes. Further, a novel association was observed for HC-PTVs and SAMHD1 damaging variants with all cancers in both sexes. Notably, SAMHD1 alleles increasing cancer risk were associated with later ANM.", "Natural fertility is closely associated with the timing of menopause, decreasing as early as ten years before menopause. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified about 300 genomic loci associated with menopause timing. These variants explain up to 38% of single nucleotide polymorphism heritability and 12% of the variance in age at natural menopause (ANM).\nGenetic studies on ANM have primarily centered on common genetic variation, with little focus on rare protein-coding variants.

Scientists have sequenced delta\u2019s mutations but are still trying to understand their significance, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. \u201cWhen we see the same mutations appearing repeatedly and independently, that suggests they\u2019re important,\u201d Rasmussen said. Scientists have the best understanding of mutations on the so-called spike protein \u2014 which sticks out from the surface of the virus like a club \u2014 and which have been studied the most intensely because of its serious ramifications, Rasmussen said. The coronavirus uses the spike protein to enter human cells, and changes in the spike can help the virus evade antibodies", ". Delta\u2019s future course Scientists say it\u2019s impossible to predict exactly how delta will behave in the future, although Topol said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d Topol noted that delta outbreaks tend to last 10 to 12 weeks, as the virus \u201cburns through\u201d susceptible populations. If the United States continues to follow a pattern seen in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, infections could rise from the current seven-day moving average of 42,000 cases to 250,000 a day. Yet Topol said the United States is unlikely to suffer the high death rates seen in India, Tunisia and Indonesia because nearly half the population here is fully vaccinated. While some studies have concluded that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine stimulates strong and persistent antibodies against delta, a new report found that antibodies elicited by one shot may not be enough to neutralize delta. Authors of that study, from the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, suggested a second dose may be needed", ".\u201d By failing to contain the virus through vaccination, wearing masks and avoiding crowds, people are allowing the coronavirus to morph into increasingly dangerous forms, said Dr. William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor who helped design treatments for HIV/AIDS. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better, and we\u2019re making it better,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving half the population vaccinated and half unvaccinated and unprotected \u2014 that is the exact experiment I would design if I were a devil and trying to design a vaccine-busting virus.\u201d Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service. It is an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation which is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.", ". Scientists believe one of the most important areas of the spike is the receptor-binding domain, the specific part of the protein that allows the virus to latch onto a receptor on the surface of our cells, said Vaughn Cooper, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of Pittsburgh. Receptors are like sockets or docking stations that allow proteins to interact with the cell. Once the virus gains entry to the cell, it can cause havoc, hijacking the cell\u2019s genetic machinery and turning it into a virus-making factory. Delta\u2019s worrisome mix Delta\u2019s rapid spread is particularly surprising given it lacks two mutations that made earlier variants so scary. Delta doesn\u2019t have the N501Y spike mutation found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants, which enabled them to invade cells more successfully than the original virus. That mutation changed one amino acid \u2014 a building block of proteins \u2014 in the receptor-binding domain", ". Two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protect 94% of people from any symptomatic infection by the alpha variant, compared with 88% against the delta variant, according to a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine protect 75% of people from alpha and 67% from delta. Cooper said COVID vaccines offer remarkably good protection. \u201cI will always celebrate these vaccines as the scientific achievements of my lifetime,\u201d he said. The best way to slow down the evolution of variants is to share vaccines with the world, vaccinating as many people as possible, Bedford said. Because viruses undergo genetic changes only when they spread from one host to another, stopping transmission denies them a chance to mutate. Whether the coronavirus evolves more deadly variants \u201cis totally in our hands,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIf the number of infections remains high, it\u2019s going to continue to evolve", ".

Delta doesn\u2019t have the N501Y spike mutation found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants, which enabled them to invade cells more successfully than the original virus", ". Like all the identified variants in circulation, delta contains a spike mutation called D614G, sometimes known as \u201cDoug,\u201d which became ubiquitous last year. Scientists think Doug increases the density of spike protein on the surface of viral particles and makes it easier for the virus to enter cells. Delta also has a spike mutation called P681R, which closely resembles a mutation in the alpha variant that appears to produce higher viral loads in patients, Cooper said. People infected with delta have 1,000 times more virus in their respiratory tract, making them more likely to spread the virus when they sneeze, cough or talk. The P681R mutation, also found in the kappa variant, is located at the beginning of a part of the genome called the furin cleavage site, Cooper said. Furin is a naturally occurring human enzyme that gets hijacked by the coronavirus, which uses it to slice the spike protein into the optimal shape for entering the cell, Rasmussen said", ". Delta has kept some of the most successful mutations found in earlier variants, but also contains new genetic changes that enable it to spread twice as fast. Delta is more dangerous in many ways. It has an incubation period of four days, rather than six, making people contagious sooner. When the pandemic began, people spread the original coronavirus to an average of two or three people. Today, people infected with delta infect six people, on average. As of this week, the delta variant had caused at least 92% of the new infections in the United States, according to covariants.org, a research firm in Bern, Switzerland. Although delta isn\u2019t necessarily any more lethal than other variants, it can kill huge numbers of people simply because it infects so many more, said Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute", ". The new mutation makes that sculpting more efficient, Rasmussen said. Another delta mutation \u2014 also found in kappa and epsilon \u2014 is called L452R. Experiments suggest this mutation, which also affects the receptor-binding domain, acts to prevent antibodies from neutralizing the virus, Cooper said. These mutations appear to be more formidable as a team than alone. The genetic changes \u201care certainly doing something, but why that combination makes the delta variant more fit is not entirely obvious,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cPutting them together seems to matter.\u201d Delta also has developed genetic changes not seen in other variants. One such spike mutation is called D950N. \u201cThis might be unique,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that anywhere else.\u201d The D950N mutation is different than other mutations because it\u2019s located outside the receptor-binding domain in an area of the coronavirus genome that helps the virus fuse with human cells, Cooper said", "By \u2014 Liz Szabo, Kaiser Health News Liz Szabo, Kaiser Health News Leave a comment 0comments Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-these-mutations-made-delta-the-most-transmissible-covid-variant-yet Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter How these mutations made delta the most transmissible COVID variant yet Health Jul 29, 2021 4:56 PM EDT Upon first inspection, the mutations in the highly contagious delta COVID variant don\u2019t look that worrisome. For starters, delta has fewer genetic changes than earlier versions of the coronavirus. \u201cWhen people saw that the epidemic in India was driven by delta, they did not suspect it would be so bad or overtake other variants,\u201d said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. But those expectations were wrong", ". Fusing with human cells allows the coronavirus to dump its genetic material into those cells. This mutation could affect which types of cells the virus infects, potentially allowing it to harm different organs and tissues. Mutations in this region are also associated with higher viral loads, Cooper said. Delta also contains mutations in a part of the spike protein called the N-terminal domain, which provides a \u201csupersite\u201d for antibodies to latch onto the virus and prevent it from entering cells, said Dr. Hana Akselrod, an infectious diseases specialist at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. Mutations in this region make monoclonal antibodies less effective in treating COVID and increases the delta variant\u2019s ability to escape vaccine-generated antibodies, Akselrod said. That may explain why vaccinated people are slightly more likely to become infected with delta, causing mostly mild illness but allowing them to transmit the virus", "Upon first inspection, the mutations in the highly contagious delta COVID variant don\u2019t look that worrisome.

However, there are also concerns about how this information will be used, particularly in regards to treatment access and insurance coverage.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Genetic Counseling, individuals who carry rare genetic mutations, such as DAT-K619N, may face barriers in accessing healthcare and insurance coverage due to discrimination and stigmatization.
