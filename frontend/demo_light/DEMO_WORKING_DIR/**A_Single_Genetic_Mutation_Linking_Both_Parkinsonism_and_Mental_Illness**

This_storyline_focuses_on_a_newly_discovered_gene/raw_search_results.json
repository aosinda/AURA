Other pathways include the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways.\nDopamine pathways are neuronal connections in which dopamine travels to areas of the brain and body to convey important information such as executive thinking, cognition, feelings of reward and pleasure, and voluntary movement.\nMesolimbic pathways", "High levels of dopamine can make people feel euphoric in the short term; however, over time, it can be detrimental. In excess, dopamine can be a contributing factor in mania, hallucinations, and delusions.\nA surplus of dopamine can result in more competitive behaviors, aggression, poor control over impulses, gambling behaviors, and addiction.\nAs such, addictive drugs can increase levels of dopamine, encouraging the individual to continue to use these drugs to reach that pleasurable feeling of reward.\nThis does not just have to be an addiction to drugs; people can be addicted to anything which gives them a surge of dopamine, such as video games, food, and social media use.\nHow do I get my dopamine levels back to normal?\nDepending on whether dopamine levels are too high or low will determine what techniques to take.

This chemical can also contribute to feelings of:\n-\nAlertness\n-\nFocus\n-\nMotivation\n-\nHappiness\nDopamine is released when the brain is anticipating a reward. The flood of dopamine to the brain when experiencing a pleasurable stimulus (e.g., delicious food, video games, sex) can reinforce wanting to engage with this stimulus more due to the pleasurable feeling it causes.\nThis is a cycle of motivation, reward, and reinforcement. When associating a certain activity with pleasure, sometimes even mere anticipation may be enough to raise dopamine levels.", "Research since the dopamine hypothesis has indicated that glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, and serotonin alterations are also involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, so it may not be dopamine alone which affects this condition.\nWhat about the future?\nWe know a lot about two types of dopamine receptors in the brain, but less about three others. Using mice in research, scientists discovered the importance of the D5 receptor in male and female sexual behaviors. Also, some research shows mice might like sugar even if they can\u2019t produce dopamine.\nNotably, there\u2019s a growing consensus that studying dopamine should not be in isolation but in conjunction with other transmitter systems. This integrated approach recognizes the broader neuronal organization and connectivity in the brain.\nEven though dopamine neurons comprise less than 1% of brain neurons, alterations in dopamine levels or functions can significantly influence behavior.", "In the anticipation phase, where participants were told they might win money, blood flow was found in the amygdala and frontal cortex, indicating activity in the nucleus accumbens and the hypothalamus, all rich in dopamine receptors.\nThe bigger the potential reward, the greater dopamine-led brain activity was found.\nConditioned reinforcement\nBy allowing dopamine to affect choices, it can bias towards choosing the stimulus that was learned from the amount of positive or negative reinforcement the stimulus received.\nReward-associated motivational stimuli can serve as conditioned reinforcers when given after a response.\nFor instance, in a study on rats, when they were thirsty, they learned to work for the presentation of a light that was previously paired with water.", "This underscores the idea that dopamine\u2019s primary role might be integrating information pertinent to biologically significant stimuli rather than transmitting specific data.\nFAQs\nWhat happens if dopamine is depleted?\nLow dopamine levels may result in some of the following symptoms:\n\u2013 Reduced alertness\n\u2013 Difficulty concentrating\n\u2013 A lack of motivation\n\u2013 Poor coordination\n\u2013 Movement difficulties\n\u2013 Inability to feel pleasure\nIn more extreme cases, a lack of dopamine could result in conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, or depression.\nAlthough dopamine alone may not directly cause depression, low levels of dopamine have been suggested to cause specific symptoms associated with this condition, such as motivational issues, feeling hopeless and helpful, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.", "Dopamine fasting is a recent trend where people strive to \u2018reset\u2019 their dopamine levels by completely abstaining from anything that brings them pleasure. This can include phone use, social media, video games, delicious food, sex, and social interaction.\nTaking breaks from behaviors that trigger strong amounts of dopamine release could allow the brain to recover and restore itself, being an antidote to the age of overstimulation we live in.\nKent Berridge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience, suggests that taking a break from a stimulating activity (or all of them) will not reset dopamine levels, but it can stop the dopamine system from turning on constantly.\nDopamine fast is not believed to be something that can reduce dopamine, but having breaks from one or two pleasurable activities at a time can help in reducing impulsive behaviors.", "This dopamine pathway is highly involved in the functions of pleasure and reward. Beginning at the VTA, dopamine produced here projects to the nucleus accumbens.\nWhen here, dopamine primarily mediates feelings of pleasure and reward. For instance, if someone eats a food they enjoy, dopamine is released from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens which then creates positive feelings that reinforce the behavior.\nSometimes stimuli can create intense feelings of euphoria.\nThe nucleus accumbens is found in the ventral striatum and is part of a complex circuit involving the amygdala and the hippocampus. The activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway communicates that it wants to repeat what just happened to feel the rewarding sensation again.\nSince the nucleus accumbens has connections to the amygdala, a region of the limbic system associated with emotions, this attributes feelings towards the experienced reward.", "Taylor, J.

These then project to the infundibular region of the hypothalamus. In this pathway, dopamine is released into the portal circulation that connects this region to the pituitary gland.\nHere, dopamine functions to inhibit prolactin release. Prolactin is a protein secreted by the pituitary gland that enables milk production and has important functions in metabolism, sexual satisfaction, and the immune system.\nDopamine Hypothesis In Schizophrenia\nThe dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia suggests that some of the symptoms of schizophrenia involve excess dopamine activity.\nThe dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was derived from observations in the 1960s where the effects of amphetamines resembled schizophrenia. Amphetamines increase dopamine function (Seeman et al., 1976).", "Also, dopamine abnormalities in the temporal and prefrontal areas of the brain are believed to be overactive in those with schizophrenia and thus can lead to some of the positive symptoms of the condition, such as hallucinations and delusions.\nThis hypothesis aligns with the use of some antipsychotic drug medications, which work to block dopamine receptor in the brain appear to be effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.\nLikewise, the effects of dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine, over repeated exposure, may gradually induce paranoid psychosis in non-schizophrenic people.\nThis well-documented observation shows that sustained increases in dopamine activity can cause some of the similar symptoms of schizophrenia.\nHowever, the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia may be an oversimplification as there may be many other neuronal network abnormalities and neurotransmitter systems involved in causing the condition.", "In addition, a specific study showed that dopamine fasting from the social media platform Facebook for a week helped students regain 13.3 hours of their time and significantly reduced depressive symptoms by 17%, which allowed them to engage in more healthy behaviors instead (Mosquere et al., 2019).\nReferences\nBrisch, R., Saniotis, A., Wolf, R., Bielau, H., Bernstein, H.

As a dopamine signal approaches a nearby neuron, it binds to that neuron\u2019s receptor.\nThe receptor and neurotransmitter work like a lock and key. The dopamine attaches to the dopamine receptor, delivering its chemical message by causing changes to occur in the neuron that received the signal.", "Dopamine appears to play a big role in the activity of the frontal and temporal lobes, particularly parts of the cerebral cortex of these lobes that play a role in the cognitive, emotional, and perceptual functions that are often abnormal in schizophrenia.\nHowever, inconsistencies in post-mortem findings and debates on whether certain changes were due to drugs or the disease made it challenging to pinpoint schizophrenia\u2019s exact link with dopamine. Yet, imaging studies revealed that schizophrenic patients release more dopamine than healthy individuals in response to certain scenarios (Laruelle et al., 1996).\nThe discovery of organic changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients through imaging techniques shifted the focus to viewing schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "This dopamine pathway is involved in motor planning. The dopamine projections start in the substantia nigra, a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain.\nThese projections go to the caudate and putamen, which are also parts of the basal ganglia. The neurons in this pathway stimulate purposeful movement and contain about 80% of the dopamine in the brain.\nIf there are reductions in the number of dopamine neurons in this pathway, this can result in motor control impairments, including movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nSymptoms of dysfunction in this pathway may include spasms, contractions, tremors, and motor restlessness.\nTuberoinfundibular pathways\nThe dopamine neurons in this pathway originate in the hypothalamus, an area that plays a role in hormone production and helps to stimulate many important processes in the body.", "There are dopamine pathways that can be triggered when exposed to a stimulus that is rewarding, resulting in increased amounts of dopamine circulating around brain areas.\nRole Of Dopamine On Learning And Motivation\nReward System\nDopamine plays a key role in the brain\u2019s reward system. This neurotransmitter helps to reinforce certain behaviors that result in a reward.\nIn classical studies of rats, a surge of dopamine prompts the animal to press a lever to get a pellet of food repeatedly.\nThis works similarly in humans, for instance, when choosing to eat more pleasurable food, such as another slice of cake, because we have enjoyed the rewarding feeling the food has given us.\nReward Prediction\nSome lines of study have found that midbrain dopamine neurons can be activated by proximal contact (touch, taste) with unexpected rewards."], "title": "Dopamine Function in the Brain - Simply Psychology"}, "https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/060824/genetic-variant-clarifies-why-parkinsons-develops": {"url": "https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/060824/genetic-variant-clarifies-why-parkinsons-develops", "description": "Such linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens.

In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson\u2019s: linkage analysis and association studies.\nLinkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson\u2019s, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson\u2019s appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.", "Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that influence the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease.\nMore patients and families participating in genetic research are needed to find additional components of the engine behind Parkinson\u2019s. Each person\u2019s genome has about 27 million variants of the 6 billion building blocks that make up their genes. There are many more genetic components for Parkinson\u2019s that have yet to be found.\nAs our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson\u2019s.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease. However, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \u201clinked\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson\u2019s. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson\u2019s? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "Many factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson\u2019s, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson\u2019s aren\u2019t inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.\nNevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson\u2019s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations", "\u201cLinkage\u201d between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis.

Your provider can tell you more about if your condition is treatable and what your treatment options are with your specific case and circumstances.\nParkinsonism refers to a wide range of conditions and diseases with similar effects and symptoms. Most of these diseases and conditions are severe and have a high risk of complications when there\u2019s a delay in diagnosing and treating them.", "Experts suspect Parkinson\u2019s disease happens because of a problem with how your body uses a certain protein, \u03b1-synuclein (alpha sy-nu-clee-in). Proteins are chemical molecules that have a very specific shape. When some proteins don\u2019t have the correct shape \u2014 a problem known as protein misfolding \u2014 your body can\u2019t use them and can't break them down.\nWith nowhere to go, the proteins build up in various places or in certain cells, like the dopamine-using cells that control movement.

However, finding time in a busy clinical practice for this type of evaluation can be challenging. While several scales for detecting depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders, and apathy have been validated for use in PD, there are currently no definitive rating tools for PD psychosis. Despite these barriers, this is a vitally important task as the consequences of failing to recognize and treat neuropsychiatric disorders can be severe. Data from a large multicenter NIH clinical trial showed that at least 40% of participants with depression were untreated.

There are also many other symptoms that can insidiously affect the coping abilities of the care partner. Apathy is a major source of frustration, stress, and conflict between patients and care partners. The lack of motivation, indifference, and diminished interests of a patient with PD who also has significant apathy is frequently misinterpreted by family and care partners as willful laziness or depression.\nPatients with insomnia and frequent nocturnal awakenings, whether due to frequent nocturia, REM-sleep behavioral disorder, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal immobility, or the need for medication administration in the middle of the night, can severely disrupt sleep for the care partner. A sleep-deprived care partner is unlikely to function well throughout the day.", "Participation in adult day care programs several times a week is particularly appropriate for patients with PD and dementia, providing mental stimulation for the patient and predictable respite for the care partner.

Relocating to a continuing care retirement center may be appropriate, although it is often a difficult decision emotionally and financially. Care partners should be encouraged to consult a social worker, an elder-law specialist, or the local department of aging for additional recommendations.\nThe health of patients with PD and their care partners are intertwined. Physicians treating the patient with PD must discuss these issues with family members and request permission to forward their observations and concerns to the physicians caring for the care partner.", "Complications of PD treatment, especially on-off fluctuations, can affect mental health in patients with PD (Box 1). Physicians are generally aware that after several years of PD the motor responses to dopaminergic therapies often begin to fluctuate. Initially, patients can experience wearing off of the motor benefits of levodopa therapy (eg, increased bradykinesia, tremor, gait disturbance, or rigidity) at the end of the dosing period. In more advanced PD, the fluctuating motor symptoms worsen, becoming more intense and less predictable in relation to the timing of medication. Significant nonmotor fluctuations, including marked anxiety, panic attacks, and severely altered mood may occur in addition to motor fluctuations.

Family members, spouses, and friends increasingly assume the role of care partner as a patient\u2019s course of illness progresses. Ideally, as a patient\u2019s disability becomes more severe, this partnership helps the patient better manage symptoms, comply with treatment, and remain in the home. Yet the ability of a care partner to provide help is more often confounded by the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the patient than the overall severity of his or her physical impairment. Therefore, best management should include not only treatments for the neuropsychiatic symptoms in the patient with PD but also awareness and support for the patient\u2019s care partners.11", "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a disorder defined and diagnosed by its disabling motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor.

Despite the burden neuropsychiatric symptoms bring, they often go unrecognized and untreated. Similarly, although there are a number of evidence-based drug treatments, physical and occupational therapies, and assistive devices to address motor impairments of PD, most neuropsychiatric symptoms are treated off-label with drugs that have little or no evidence for efficacy or safety when used in this population. At least two-thirds of individuals with PD will have a clinically significant neuropsychiatric disorder during the course of their disease, and most will have more than 1 disorder concurrently (Table).", "Providing assistance for a person with PD sometimes evolves into an overwhelming burden, upending lives and creating serious levels of family dysfunction.

If not judiciously prescribed, the polypharmacy often needed to diminish motor and nonmotor fluctuations can trigger serious iatrogenic problems, including hallucinations, psychosis, or impulse control disorders. Unfortunately, some patients might surreptitiously overmedicate themselves due to the fear of experiencing the unpleasant off-period anxiety and dysphoria. Frequent dosing and medication overuse often results in addiction-like behavior known as the dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which is characterized by increased dopaminergic drug craving and use despite serious medication-induced side effects. Comorbid impulse-control disorders, psychosis, and panic attacks are common in dopamine dysregulation syndrome.6 Patients often use motor terminology to describe a need related to their craving of more medication, and this often results in misdiagnosis.", "\u2022 Enlist other family members to assist on a regularly scheduled basis\n\u2022 Hire aides at home for several hours on a regular basis\n\u2022 Participate in exercise programs\n\u2022 Participate in education seminars and support groups\n\u2022 Consult with a mental health professional\n\u2022 Have a home safety evaluation\n\u2022 Make use of adult day-care programs\nCare partners must be reminded that their health is at stake, and that they are entitled to have some free time to recharge their emotional batteries.

Optimizing dopaminergic management for the motor symptoms of PD can improve the patient\u2019s level of activity but does not eliminate apathy.\nImpulse-Control Disorders\nTreatment of impulse-control disorders includes eliminating the triggering agent, which is usually a dopamine agonist, and obtaining appropriate psychiatric consultation.\nPsychosis", ". Similarly, untreated anxiety has been shown to worsen freezing of gait and the on-off fluctuations related to dopaminergic treatment. Failing to recognize a patient\u2019s impulse-control disorders can lead to her or his financial ruin, divorce, and legal problems. Psychosis is associated with agitation and a broad range of behavioral problems that can make daily life at home unmanageable.", "Treating psychosis is a bit more problematic because first- and second-generation antipsychotics can worsen the motor symptoms of PD and may increase the risk of mortality.10 Therefore, few are considered safe for use in patients with PD; according to a 2011 Movement Disorder Society review, only clozapine, quetiapine, and pimavanserin are recommended.7 Even among these, the choice of treatment may be fraught with tradeoffs. For instance, although proven effective, clozapine requires weekly blood monitoring and has a host of serious potential side effects. Quetiapine is deemed to have acceptable risk without monitoring but is sedating and lacks evidence for efficacy. The newest agent, pimavanserin, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psychosis in patients with nondemented PD. However, pimavanserin has not yet been proven to work in patients with PD psychosis with dementia.\nMental Health Considerations for Caregivers", ".

While there are currently no evidence-based drug treatments for anxiety in persons with PD, antidepressants are likely useful, and cognitive-behavioral therapy has demonstrated efficacy across several trials for both anxiety and depression.9\nApathy", "Impulse-control disorders are associated with the use of dopamine-agonist medications that are often used to treat motor symptoms in patients with PD.3 Compulsive behaviors and impulse-control disorders, most commonly pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, and uncontrolled spending, can be triggered by dopaminergic therapies. Impulse-control disorders are particularly prevalent (>10%) in patients receiving dopamine agonists. Despite the serious psychosocial and financial consequences of impulse-control disorders, they frequently go unrecognized as many physicians are not accustomed to inquiring about gambling, sexual behavior, or spending patterns.\nPsychosis", "Screening", "Visual hallucinations and illusions are common in patients with PD. Fortunately, severe psychosis\u2014one of the most feared psychiatric disturbance in PD\u2014, which also includes delusions and behavioral disturbances, affects only about 5% to 10% of patients.4,5 There are several factors that predispose patients with PD to psychosis. So-called intrinsic factors include underlying cognitive decline, dementia (dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia), advanced age, long-standing PD, sleep deprivation, and visual processing abnormalities. So-called extrinsic factors include the use of dopamine agonists, amantadine, anticholinergics, or higher doses of carbidopa\u2013levodopa combinations. The motor symptoms of patients with psychosis and PD should be managed with monotherapy, if possible, using carbidopa\u2013levodopa combinations at the lowest doses required to control symptoms. Avoiding polypharmacy will decrease the risk of psychotic symptoms", "The fear of leaving the patient alone for a few hours, or the patient\u2019s fear of being left alone, founded or not, can enslave the care partner for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The resulting social isolation severely impairs the quality of life of the care partner. Care partners commonly experience anger, denial, guilt, resentment, irritability, depression, anxiety, fatigue, exhaustion, and the sense of being overwhelmed. Patients may sense that they are being ignored, neglected, or abused\u2014emotionally, verbally, or physically. These are unpleasant feelings that care partners and patients may not want to divulge to each other. Therefore, it is important that the care partner and patient have an opportunity to speak to the physician privately, allowing them to vent their emotions without fear of embarrassment or recrimination.\nBox 2.

This suggests that the pathological process of PD overlaps with the mechanisms underpinning anxiety and depression.\nApathy\nApathy affects up to one-third of patients but is often unrecognized.2 Apathy, characterized by loss of motivation, lack of concern, diminished interests, and flat affect, is common in patients with PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Apathy can occur as an isolated neuropsychiatric phenomenon or as part of a depressive disorder. Although the patient is often too unmotivated to complain, apathy is associated with diminished quality of life and greatly increased burden and distress for care partner(s).\nImpulse-Control Disorders", "If family members are unavailable to provide consistent help, hiring aides on a regular basis is a helpful option. Care partners often resist this recommendation, saying \u201cno one can care for my loved on like I can.\u201d Although that may be true, hiring aides does help prevent burnout for someone providing care. Care partners should be reassured that patients often benefit from the variety of interacting with an aide, and having a more relaxed and refreshed care partner.

It can also present as cognitive problems, such as poor concentration, attention, learning, and memory. Depression affects up to 50% of people with PD, and may be present before diagnosis. \u201cReactive\u201d depression, which develops in response to a serious condition such as PD, is common. But for many people with PD, their depression is thought to be an underlying part of their disease, just as much as tremor or slowed movements.

The impairments of MCI are not enough to interfere significantly with activities of daily living. More significant cognitive impairment is termed dementia. Dementia is also common in PD, though exactly how common is still under investigation. Dementia does interfere with activities of daily living, and requires an increased level of care. When dementia begins within one year of motor symptoms, the diagnosis dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is used instead of Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (PDD).

Anxiety is common in PD, and often coexists with depression. Like depression, anxiety can manifest before diagnosis of PD. It can cause the person with PD to avoid social situations, increasing social isolation. Anxiety is often treated with the same medications, used to treat depression. In addition, other drugs called benzodiazepines (including diazepam and clonazepam) can be used to treat anxiety. Understanding the potential side effects before starting any medication is crucial.

Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease.\nHowever, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \"linked\" and \"associated\" discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson's. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson's? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "There is currently no treatment to slow or halt Parkinson's disease. Available drugs don't slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson's, it's improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.\nMany factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson's, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson's aren't inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.", "Nevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson's disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson's that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations\nIn the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson's might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson's: linkage analysis and association studies.", "While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell's trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell's immune system recognizes as \"self\" rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson's is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease. Like the owner's manual to your car's engine, it provides a practical guide of what to check when the motor fails.", "Linkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson's, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson's appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.\n\"Linkage\" between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes.", "Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is lost in Parkinson's as the cells that produce it progressively die. Together, these linked genes and the proteins they encode regulate specialized autophagy processes. In addition, these encoded proteins enable immunity within cells.\nSuch linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson's in later life.\nRAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries.

As stated above, this type of mutation occurs due to aging, exposure to toxins and chemicals, and certain viral infections.10\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, somatic mutations have no significant impact, but they may lead to disease conditions if they are systematic and alter the cell survival capacity. For instance, cancers are potent somatic mutations that influence an organism's survival.\nMany genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease, are inherited. Different genetic mutation patterns that are passed on from the parent to a child and lead to disease conditions are discussed below:11", "Genetic disorders can occur due to mutations in one gene (monogenic), multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance), and mutation in one or more chromosomes. Point mutations are where one nucleotide in a genomic sequence is replaced or substituted with another.6 Chromosomes can fuse, translocate, and break, resulting in the loss of a large number of functional genes, whose consequences can be harmful.7\nDifferent types of transposable elements are regarded as another source of mutation. These are small DNA entities that can move around within the entire genome. A transposon might disrupt existing gene functions when it gets inserted in the middle of another genetic region, trigger dormant gene functions, or produce new proteins by inserting different genetic materials into an existing genetic sequence.8", "- Autosomal recessive: For disease expression, both parents need to pass the same genetic mutations to the child.

Thrombocytopenia, a condition associated with low platelet counts, is an example of this mutation pattern.\n- Y-linked: Male babies having Y chromosomes can inherit this mutation. This mutation type is linked with webbed toes.\n- Mitochondrial: Mitochondrial inherence is also known as maternal inheritance because mitochondria from the egg survive fertilization.

An impaired DNA repair system that is responsible for correcting any errors during cell division is directly associated with gene mutation.5\nKey types of mutations", "Genetic mutation may also occur through the insertion or deletion of a few nucleotides.6 In the case of nonsynonymous mutation, an entire amino acid sequence is changed. This type of mutation results in the production of a different protein or premature termination of a protein. Synonymous mutations are linked with changes in amino acids that are encoded by multiple codons.9\nMutation patterns and diseases\nCell divisions are of two types: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, whereas meiosis occurs in the gamete cells, i.e., egg and sperm cells. Mutations appearing in reproductive cells, called germline mutation, are heritable as they are passed on to offspring. This type of mutation is also known as an inherited mutation. Somatic mutations that occur in cells other than germ cells are not heritable.", "Genetic counseling helps patients and their families to understand the implications of genetic testing and treatment strategies.

Mutations and epigenetic silencing in MMR genes have been implicated in up to 90% of human hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancers, indicating the significance of this repair system in maintaining genomic stability. Post-replicative MMR is performed by the long-patch MMR mechanism in which multiple proteins are involved and a relatively long tract of the oligonucleotide is excised during the repair reaction.

As expected, HR is extremely accurate, as it leads to precise repair of the damaged locus using DNA sequences homologous to the broken ends. HR predominantly uses the sister chromatid as a template for DSB repair, rather than the homologous chromosome. Correspondingly, HR is largely inhibited while cells are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when the sister chromatid has not yet been replicated, as shown in panel (A) of Figure (\\PageIndex{19}\\) below. HR repair mechanisms play a bigger role in DSB repair that occurs after S-phase DNA replication (S-phase, G2, and M).", "Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways act competitively to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Key players of NHEJ and HR are depicted. The MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex is recruited very early at DNA ends and appears to play important roles for both NHEJ and HR. Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is required for NHEJ and, through inhibition of DNA end resection (5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exo), acts as a repressor of HR. The fidelity of NHEJ-dependent DSB repair is low and, most of the time, associated with nucleotide deletions and/or insertions at repair junctions. The common early step of HR-dependent mechanisms is the formation of ssDNA which is then coated by replication protein A (RPA). Single-strand annealing (SSA) mechanism requires the presence of direct repeats (shown in orange) on both sides of the break. SSA does not imply any strand invasion process and is therefore not dependent on RAD51 protein", "In multicellular organisms, the response to DNA damage can result in two major physiological consequences: (1) Cells can undergo cell cycle arrest, repair the damage, and re-enter the cell cycle, or (2) cells can be targeted for cell death (apoptosis) and removed from the population. The cell cycle process is highly conserved and precisely controlled to govern the genome duplication and separation into the daughter cells. The cell cycle consists of four distinct and ordered phases, termed G0/G1 (gap 1), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (gap 2), and M (mitosis). Multiple checkpoints exist within each stage of the cell cycle to ensure the faithful replication of DNA in the S phase and the precise separation of the chromosomes into daughter cells. The G1 and G2 phases are critical regulatory checkpoints, whereby the restriction point between the G1 and S phase determines whether the cells enter the S phase or exit the cell cycle to halt at the G0 phase", "Smaller scale deletions and insertions also cause various effects. Because codons are triplets of nucleotides, insertions or deletions in groups of three nucleotides may lead to the insertion or deletion of one or more amino acids and may not cause significant effects on the resulting protein\u2019s functionality. However, frameshift mutations, caused by insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides that are not a multiple of three are extremely problematic because a shift in the reading frame results, as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\). Because ribosomes read the mRNA in triplet codons, frameshift mutations can change every amino acid after the point of the mutation.

Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. By the same token, any random change in a gene's DNA is more likely to result in the production of a protein that does not function normally or may not function at all, than in a mutation that improves the function. Such mutations are likely to be harmful. Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer.", "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair system that greatly contributes to maintaining genome stability through the correction of mismatched base pairs and small modifications of DNA bases, such as alkylation. The major source of mismatched base pairs is replication error, although it can arise also from other biological processes. Thus, the MMR machinery must have a mechanism for determining which strand of the DNA is the template strand and which strand has been newly synthesized. In E. coli, methylation of the DNA is a common post-replicative modification that occurs. Thus, in newly synthesized DNA, the unmethylated strand is recognized as the new strand, and the methylated strand is used as the template to repair mismatches. In E.coli, MMR increases the accuracy of DNA replication by 20\u2013400-fold", "- Mutations have occurred in bacteria that allow the bacteria to survive in the presence of antibiotic drugs.

Occasionally, germline mutations may lead to a beneficial mutation that enhances the survival of an individual within a population. If this gene proves to enhance the survival of the population, it will be selected over time within the population and cause the evolution of that species. An example of a beneficial mutation is the case of a population of people that show resistance to HIV infection. Since the first case of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reported in 1981, nearly 40 million people have died from HIV infection, the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus targets helper T cells that play a key role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune response, infecting and killing cells normally involved in the body\u2019s response to infection", "Repair through HR is not defined by a unique mechanism but operates through various mechanistically distinct DSB repair processes, including synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), double Holliday junction resolution, and single-strand annealing (SSA). The common step for HR-dependent DSB repair mechanisms is the initial formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for pairing with homologous DNA template sequences. For this to occur, the 5' DNA strand at the DSB is processed by multiple nucleases and accessory proteins to create a 3' ssDNA section that can be used as a template for recombination (see Figure 18 above).", "Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure or number. They occur when a section of a chromosome breaks off and rejoins incorrectly or does not rejoin at all. Possible ways these mutations can occur are illustrated in the figure below. Chromosomal alterations are very serious. They often result in the death of the cell or organism in which they occur. If the organism survives, it may be affected in multiple ways. An example of a human chromosomal alteration is the mutation that causes Down Syndrome. It is a duplication mutation that leads to developmental delays and other abnormalities. It occurs when the individual inherits an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is also called trisomy (\"three-chromosome\") 21", ". Subsequent repair of the adduct will result in the replacement of the damaged guanine base with thymine, causing a G --> T transversion mutation.", "25.2.7 Repair of Double-Stranded DNA Breaks\nCells have evolved two main pathways to repair double-strand breaks within the DNA: the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which ensures direct resealing of DNA ends; and the homologous recombination (HR) pathway that relies on the presence of homologous DNA sequences for DSB repair, as shown in Figure (\\PageIndex{18}\\) below.", "Mutations are random changes that occur within the sequence of bases in DNA. They can be large-scale, altering the structure of the chromosomes, or small scale where they only alter a few or even a single base or nucleotide. Mutations can occur for many reasons. For example, DNA mutations can be caused by mistakes made by the DNA polymerase during replication. As noted in chapter 9, DNA polymerases are highly processive enzymes that contain proofreading and editing functions. With these safeguards, their error rates are typically very low and range from one in a million bases to one in a billion bases. Even with such high fidelity, this error rate will lead to between 3 and 3,000 errors within the human genome for each cell undergoing DNA replication.

The relevance of HR in these physiological processes is illustrated by its strict requirement during development. Mice lacking key HR genes, such as Brca1, Brca2, or Rad51, display extensive genetic alterations which lead to early embryonic lethality. Whereas homozygous inactivation of HR genes is usually embryonic lethal, heterozygous inactivation of,BRCA1 and BRCA2, does not interfere with cellular viability but rather predisposes individuals to cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer. The tumors that develop in individuals with heterozygous BRCA1/2 mutations invariably lose their second BRCA1/2 allele, indicating that in certain cancers, the absence of BRCA1/2 is compatible with cellular proliferation. How exactly such tumors cope with their HR defect is currently not fully understood.", "Video 2: Mismatch repair licensing at a mismatch.

Examples include silent point mutations, which are neutral because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode.\nSome mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are referred to as beneficial mutations. If they occur in germline cells (eggs or sperm) these traits can be heritable and passed from one generation to the next. Beneficial mutations generally code for new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to their environment. If they increase an organism\u2019s chances of surviving or reproducing, the mutations are likely to become more common within a population over time.

Here are just two:", "A transition mutation is a point mutation that changes a purine nucleotide to another purine (A \u2194 G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another pyrimidine (C \u2194 T). Transversion refers to the substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa. Sometimes lesions may cause bases to be skipped during replication or cause extra nucleotides to be inserted into the backbone. DNA polymerases can also slip during the replication of regions of the DNA that have repeated sequences or large stretches repeating a single base. Larger lesions or cross-links in the DNA during replication can lead to more catastrophic DNA damage including DNA strand breaks.

These indicated that many individuals of Eurasian descent (up to 14% in some ethnic groups) have a deletion mutation, called CCR5-delta 32, in the gene encoding CCR5. CCR5 is a coreceptor found on the surface of T-cells that is necessary for many strains of the virus to enter the host cell.

The activation of SAC transiently induces cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting the activation of APC/C. To establish and maintain the mitotic checkpoint, the TTK recruits many checkpoint proteins to kinetochores during mitosis via phosphorylating its substrates to ensure adequate chromosome segregation and genomic integrity. In this way, the genomic instability from chromosome segregation defects is protected by SAC. Once the SAC is passed, the APC/C E3 ligase complex stimulates and tags cyclin B and securin for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, leading to the initiation of mitosis. In a word, the checkpoints offer a failsafe mechanism to ensure the genomic integrity from the parental cell to the daughter cell.

Individual subunits of the complex have no sufficient affinity and selectivity to the substrate (DNA containing bulky damage). The situation changes when specific protein complexes are established at the damage site. A total of 18 polypeptides must be accurately positioned within two or three DNA turns when a stable structure ready for damage removal is formed and excision starts. The structure of NER-associated proteins provides the possibility of contact with the DNA substrate and of dynamic specific protein-protein interactions.

In contrast to BER, where a damaged base is simultaneously recognized and eliminated by a single specialized glycosylase, specialized groups of proteins are responsible for the recognition of the lesion and the excision of the lesion in NER. In eukaryotic NER, universal sensor proteins perform the initial recognition of the total range of bulky damages. In the case of TC-NER, it occurs when the transcribing RNA polymerase II is stalled by damage; in GG-NER, these are complexes of the XPC factor and DDB1-DDB2 heterodimer (XPE factor) enhancing the repair of UV damage. In general, NER recognition of damage is a multistep process involving several proteins that form near damaged complexes of variable compositions", "The vast majority of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can, in turn, disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike proteins and RNA, DNA usually lacks tertiary structure, and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, supercoiled and wound around \"packaging\" proteins called histones (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.", "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause significant cellular stress and damage including oxidative DNA damage.

The 8-oxo-dG is one of the most abundant DNA lesions, and it is considered as a biomarker of oxidative stress. It has been estimated that up to 100,000 8-oxo-dG lesions can occur daily in DNA per cell. The reduction potential of 8-oxo-dG is even lower (0.74 V vs. NHE) than that of guanosine (1.29 V vs NHE).

These are classified according to how the DNA molecule is altered. One type, a point mutation, affects a single base and most commonly occurs when one base is substituted or replaced by another. Mutations also result from the addition of one or more bases, known as an insertion, or the removal of one or more bases, known as a deletion.", "During DNA damage, the cell cycle is arrested or blocked by the action of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. As noted in Figure 12.12, this is a complicated signal transduction cascade that has many downstream effects. A primary function of cell cycle arrest is that CDK inhibition allows time for DNA repair before cell-cycle progression into the S-phase or mitosis. As shown in Figure 25.2.12, two major cell-cycle checkpoints respond to DNA damage; they occur pre- and post-DNA synthesis in the G1 and G2 phases, respectively, and impinge on the activity of specific CDK complexes. The checkpoint kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinases (PI3KKs) ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, and the transducer checkpoint kinases CHK1 (encoded by the CHEK1 gene) and CHK2 (encoded by the CHEK2 gene) are key regulators of DNA damage signaling", ". Thus, large-scale mutations in the chromosomal structure include (1) Amplifications (including gene duplications) where repetition of a chromosomal segment or presence of an extra piece of a chromosome broken piece of a chromosome may become attached to a homologous or non-homologous chromosome so that some of the genes are present in more than two doses leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them, (2) Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions, and (3) Chromosomal Rearrangements such as translocations (which interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes), insertions (which insert segments of one chromosome into another nonhomologous chromosome), and inversions (which invert or flip a section of a chromosome into the opposite orientation), as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\).", "Bulky DNA adducts and DNA crosslinks, such as those caused by UV light are repaired using Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathways. In higher eukaryotic cells, NER excises 24-32 nucleotide DNA fragments containing the damaged lesion with extreme accuracy. Reparative synthesis using the undamaged strand as a template, followed by ligation of the single-strand break that emerged as a result of the damage, is the final stage of DNA repair. The process involves the coordinated action of approximately 30 proteins that successively form complexes with variable compositions on the DNA. NER consists of two pathways distinct in terms of initial damage recognition. Global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) detects and eliminates bulky damages in the entire genome, including the untranscribed regions and silent chromatin, while transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC -NER) operates when damage to a transcribed DNA strand limits transcription activity", "The activity of error-prone DNA polymerases is tightly regulated to avoid the rampant introduction of mutations within the DNA sequence. One of the main mechanisms that is employed within a replisome that is stalled at the replication fork due to DNA damage, involves the monoubiquitination of PCNA. Recall from Chapter 9, that PCNA is the sliding clamp that enables the DNA polymerase to bind tightly enough with the DNA during replication to mediate efficient DNA synthesis. Monoubiquitination of PCNA enables the recruitment of a translesion DNA polymerases and the bypass of the damaged lesions during DNA synthesis.", "UV light can cause molecular crosslinks to form between two pyrimidine residues, commonly two thymine residues, that are positioned consecutively within a strand of DNA, as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\). Two common UV products are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6\u20134 photoproducts. These premutagenic lesions alter the structure and possibly the base pairing. Up to 50\u2013100 such reactions per second might occur in a skin cell during exposure to sunlight, but are usually corrected within seconds by photolyase reactivation or nucleotide excision repair. Uncorrected lesions can inhibit polymerases, cause misreading during transcription or replication, or lead to the arrest of replication.

This is important to avoid causing double-stranded DNA breaks that can occur when a replisome stalls at the replication fork. Under these circumstances, another strategy that cells use to respond to DNA damage is to bypass lesions found during DNA replication and continue with the replicative process. DNA damage bypass can occur by recombination mechanisms or through a novel mechanism called translesion synthesis. Translesion synthesis employs an alternate DNA polymerase that can substitute for a DNA polymerase that has stalled at the replication fork due to DNA damage. Specialized DNA polymerases, that are active in regions with DNA damage, have active sites that can accommodate fluctuations in DNA topography that enable them to bypass the lesions and continue with the replicative process.", "This exciting finding has led to new avenues in HIV research, including looking for drugs to block CCR5 binding to HIV in individuals who lack the mutation. Although DNA testing to determine which individuals carry the CCR5-delta 32 mutation is possible, there are documented cases of individuals homozygous for the mutation contracting HIV. For this reason, DNA testing for the mutation is not widely recommended by public health officials so as not to encourage risky behavior in those who carry the mutation. Nevertheless, inhibiting the binding of HIV to CCR5 continues to be a valid strategy for the development of drug therapies for those infected with HIV.\nPractice Problems\nMultiple Choice\nWhich of the following is a change in the sequence that leads to the formation of a stop codon?\n- missense mutation\n- nonsense mutation\n- silent mutation\n- deletion mutation\n[reveal-answer q=\u201d745512\u2033]Show Answer[/reveal-answer]", ".

Cancer is a disease caused by an accumulation of mutations within somatic cells. It results in cells that grow out of control and form abnormal masses of cells called tumors. It is generally caused by mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle, DNA repair, angiogenesis, and other genes that favor cell growth and survival. Because of the mutations, cells with the mutated DNA have evolved to divide without restrictions, hide from the immune system, and develop drug resistance.\nTypes of DNA Damage", "Base excision repair (BER) of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG). Oxidative DNA damage is repaired via several repair intermediates by base excision repair (BER). Through the emoval of the oxidized base, a reactive apurinic site (AP site) is formed.

Sometimes the effects of missense mutations may be only apparent under certain environmental conditions; such missense mutations are called conditional mutations. Rarely, a missense mutation may be beneficial. Under the right environmental conditions, this type of mutation may give the organism that harbors it a selective advantage. Yet another type of point mutation called a nonsense mutation, converts a codon encoding an amino acid (a sense codon) into a stop codon (a nonsense codon).

The ubiquitous compound can be found in coal tar, tobacco smoke, and many foods, especially grilled meats. Benzo[a]pyrene is a procarcinogen that needs to be biologically activated by metabolism before it forms a reactive metabolite, as in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{8}\\). Normally, when the body is exposed to foreign molecules, it will start a metabolic process that makes the molecule more hydrophilic and easier to remove as a waste product. Unfortunately, in the case of benzo[a]pyrene, the resulting metabolite is a highly reactive epoxide that forms a bulky adduct preferentially with guanine residues in DNA. If left unrepaired, during DNA replication an adenine will usually be placed across from the lesion in the daughter molecule", "Most oxidized bases are removed from DNA by enzymes operating within the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. Single-stranded DNA breaks can also be repaired through this process. Removal of oxidized bases in DNA is fairly rapid. For example, 8-oxo-dG was increased 10-fold in the livers of mice subjected to ionizing radiation, but the excess 8-oxo-dG was removed with a half-life of 11 minutes. 8-oxoG is excised by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) leaving an apurinic site (AP site), as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{16}\\). AP sites are then processed further into single-strand breaks via backbone incision of AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1). In long patch base excision repair, the base and some additional nucleotides are replaced dependent on the activity of polymerase delta (Pol\u03b4) and epsilon (Pol\u03b5) together with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The old strand is removed by Flap-endonuclease 1 (FEN1), before ligase I (LigI) ligates the backbone back together", "Point mutations (Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) and Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)) may have a wide range of effects on protein function. As a consequence of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a point mutation will commonly result in the same amino acid being incorporated into the resulting polypeptide despite the sequence change. This change would not affect the protein\u2019s structure and is thus called a silent mutation. A missense mutation results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the resulting polypeptide. The effect of a missense mutation depends on how chemically different the new amino acid is from the wild-type amino acid. The location of the changed amino acid within the protein also is important. For example, if the changed amino acid is part of the enzyme\u2019s active site or greatly affects the shape of the enzyme, then the effect of the missense mutation may be significant. Many missense mutations result in proteins that are still functional, at least to some degree", ". The cell cycle progression requires the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a group of serine/threonine kinases. CDKs are activated when they form complexes with cyclin regulatory proteins that are expressed specifically at different stages of the cell cycle. Cyclins bind to and stabilize CDKs in their active conformation. The formation of cyclin/CDKs controls the cell-cycle progression via phosphorylation of the target genes, such as tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (Rb).", "Vertical panel (c): E. coli MMR.

Coli DNA Mismatch Repair Protein Muts Binding to a G-T Mismatch (1E3M).", "NHEJ repair is the simplest and most widely utilized mechanism to repair DSB that occur in DNA. Repair by NHEJ involves direct resealing of the two broken ends independently of sequence homology. Although being active throughout the cell cycle, NHEJ is relatively more important during the G1 phase. Proteins required for NHEJ include but are not restricted to, the highly conserved Ku70/Ku80 heterodimeric complex, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and DNA Ligase IV (LIG4) in complex with XRCC4. By directly binding DNA ends, Ku70/Ku80 ensures protection against exonucleases and, as such, acts as an inhibitor of HR. Very short sequence homologies are likely to help DNA end alignment before NHEJ-dependent repair, however, they are not strictly required. NHEJ protects genetic integrity by rejoining broken strands of DNA that may otherwise be lost during DNA replication and cell regeneration", ". Short patch base excision repair constitutes of polymerase beta (Pol\u03b2) replacing the single missing base, ligase III (LigIII) ligating the DNA backbone back together, and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) aiding the process and serving as a scaffold for additional factors.", "MMR in eukaryotes and most bacteria directs the repair to the error-containing strand of the mismatched duplex by recognizing the strand discontinuities. On the other hand, E. coli MMR reads the absence of methylation as a strand discrimination signal. The MutS protein recognizes mismatches, In both MMR systems, strand discrimination is conducted by nicking endonucleases. MutL homologs from eukaryotes and most bacteria incise the discontinuous strand to introduce the entry or termination point for the excision reaction. In E. coli, MutH nicks the unmethylated strand of the duplex to generate the entry point of excision.

MutH, a nuclease, also binds to MutL. The bound DNA is scanned until a \"signal\" is detected. In E. Coli, the signal is a GATC sequence that is methylated on just one strand and nicked by the MutH on the unmethylated GATC. Helicase II binds and unwinds the DNA in the region of the mismatch. Exonucleases (3' to 5' or 5' to 3') remove the sequence on the mismatched. PolII and DNA ligase then repair the DNA.\nMutS is yet another fascinating enzyme as it must scan millions of DNA bases without initiating repair until it localizes a mismatch. A series of sequential conformation changes that lead to specific recognition of the mismatch must occur.", ". DNA double-strand breaks due to topoisomerase stalling can also occur during the transcription of DNA, as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\). Abortive catalysis and the formation of DNA strand breaks during transcriptional events may serve as a damage sensor within the cell and help to instigate DNA damage response signaling pathways that initiate DNA repair processes.", "Genetic damage produced by either exogenous or endogenous mechanisms represents an ongoing threat to the cell. To preserve genome integrity, eukaryotic cells have evolved repair mechanisms specific for different types of DNA Damage. However, regardless of the type of damage a sophisticated surveillance mechanism, that elicits DNA damage checkpoints, detects and signals its presence to the DNA repair machinery. DNA damage checkpoints have been functionally conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, with most of the relevant players in the checkpoint response highly conserved from yeast to humans. Checkpoints are induced to delay cell cycle progression and to allow cells time to repair damaged DNA before DNA replication, as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{12}\\). Once the damaged DNA is repaired, the checkpoint machinery triggers signals that will resume cell cycle progression", "24.2: DNA Mutations, Damage, and Repair\n- Page ID\n- 15194\n\\( \\newcommand{\\vecs}{\\overset { \\scriptstyle \\rightharpoonup} {\\mathbf{#1}} } \\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\vecd}{\\overset{-\\!-\\!\\rightharpoonup}{\\vphantom{a}\\smash {#1}}} \\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\id}{\\mathrm{id}}\\) \\( \\newcommand{\\Span}{\\mathrm{span}}\\)\n( \\newcommand{\\kernel}{\\mathrm{null}\\,}\\) \\( \\newcommand{\\range}{\\mathrm{range}\\,}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\RealPart}{\\mathrm{Re}}\\) \\( \\newcommand{\\ImaginaryPart}{\\mathrm{Im}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\Argument}{\\mathrm{Arg}}\\) \\( \\newcommand{\\norm}{\\| #1 \\|}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\inner}{\\langle #1, #2 \\rangle}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\Span}{\\mathrm{span}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\id}{\\mathrm{id}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\Span}{\\mathrm{span}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\kernel}{\\mathrm{null}\\,}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\range}{\\mathrm{range}\\,}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\RealPart}{\\mathrm{Re}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\ImaginaryPart}{\\mathrm{Im}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\Argument}{\\mathrm{Arg}}\\)\n\\( \\newcommand{\\norm}{\\| #1 \\|}\\)", "Panel (A) shows the DNA DSBs repair pathways in the context of cell cycle regulation.

If left unrepaired, AP sites can lead to mutation during semiconservative replication. They can cause replication fork stalling and are often bypassed by translesion synthesis, which is discussed in greater detail in section 12.8. In E. coli, adenine is preferentially inserted across from AP sites, known as the \"A rule\". The situation is more complex in higher eukaryotes, with different nucleotides showing a preference depending on the organism and environmental conditions.\nBulky Adduct Formation\nSome chemicals are biologically reactive and will form covalent linkages with biological molecules such as DNA and proteins creating large bulky adducts, or appendages, that branch off from the main molecule. We will use the mutagen/carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene, as an example for this process.", ". If a DNA polymerase encounters a damaged DNA base in the template DNA during replication it may place a random nucleotide base across from the lesion. For example, an adenine-containing nucleotide will often be added across a lesion, regardless of what the correct match should be. This can lead to the formation of transition or transversion mutations.", "During translesion synthesis, the polymerase must insert a dNTP opposite of the lesion. None of the dNTP bases will likely be able to form stable hydrogen bond interactions with the damaged lesion. Thus, the nucleotide that causes the least distortion or repulsion will usually be added across from the lesion. This can cause transition or transversion mutations to occur at the lesion location. Alternatively, translesion polymerases can be prone to slippage, and either causes an insertion or deletion mutation in the vicinity of the DNA lesion. These slippages can lead to frameshift mutations if they occur within gene coding regions. Thus, over a lifetime, translesion synthesis in multicellular organisms can lead to an accumulation of mutations within somatic cells and cause the formation of tumors and the disease of cancer.", "Fernandez-Leiro et al have determined the structure of MutS in a variety of stages along the repair pathway.

The DNA damage signaling is detected by ATM/ATR, which then phosphorylates and activates CHK2/CHK1, respectively. The activated CHK2 is involved in the activation of p53, leading to p53-dependent early phase G1 arrest to allow time for DNA repair. The activation of p53 induces the expression of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor (CKI) p21CIP1 gene, leading to the inhibition of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and subsequent upregulation of DNA repair machinery.", "As mentioned previously, increased levels of 8-oxo-dG in tissue can serve as a biomarker of oxidative stress. Furthermore, increased levels of 8-oxo-dG are frequently found associated with carcinogenesis and other disease states, as shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\). During the replication of DNA that contains 8-oxo-dG, adenine is most often incorporated across from the lesion. Following replication, the 8-oxo-dG is excised during the repair process and thymine is incorporated in its place.

An overview of these types of damage is described below.\nOxidative Damage", "If the DNA repair cannot be completed successfully or the cells cannot program to respond to the stresses of viable cell-cycle arrest, the cells face the fate of apoptosis induced by p53. The activated CHK1 mediates temporary S phase arrest through phosphorylation to inactivate CDC25A, causing ubiquitination and proteolysis. Moreover, the activated CHK1 phosphorylates and inactivates CDC25C, leading to cell-cycle arrest in the G2 phase. The active CHK1 also directly stimulates the phosphorylation of WEE1, resulting in enhancing the inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation of CDK2 and CDK1 and subsequent cell-cycle blocking in the G2 phase. The activity of WEE1 can also be stimulated by the low levels of CDK activity in the G2 cell-cycle phase. The SAC, also known as the mitotic checkpoint, functions as the monitor of the correct attachment of the chromosomes to the mitotic spindle in metaphase, which is regulated by the TTK protein kinase (TTK, also known as monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1))", "Ionizing radiation such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in DNA strands (see Figure above). Low-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replication and transcription errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to premature aging and cancer. Chemical agents that form crosslinks within the DNA, especially interstrand crosslinks, can also lead to DNA strand breaks if the damaged DNA undergoes DNA replication. Crosslinked DNA can cause topoisomerase enzymes to stall in the transition state when the DNA backbone is cleaved. Instead of relieving supercoiling and resealing the backbone, the stalled topoisomerase remains covalently linked to the DNA in a process called abortive catalysis. This leads to the formation of a single-stranded break in the case of Top1 enzymes or double-stranded breaks in the case of Top2 enzymes", "- Germline mutations occur in gametes, the sex cells, such as eggs and sperm. These mutations are especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutations.\n- Somatic mutations occur in other cells of the body. These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. Somatic mutations also cannot be passed on to offspring.\nMutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed. Mutations may change an entire chromosome or just one or a few nucleotides.", "Panel B of Figure (\\PageIndex{19}\\) below provides a more detailed look at the HR process. During the highly regulated process of HR, three main phases can be distinguished. Firstly, 3\u2032-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends are generated by nucleolytic degradation of the 5\u2032-strands. This first step is catalyzed by endonucleases, including the MRN complex (consisting of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1). In the second step, the ssDNA-ends are coated by replication protein A (RPA) filaments. In the third step, RPA is replaced by Rad51 in a BRCA1- and BRCA2-dependent process, to ultimately perform the recombinase reaction using a homologous DNA template.", "Alkylating agents are widespread in the environment and are also produced endogenously, as by-products of cellular metabolism. They introduce lesions into DNA or RNA bases that can be cytotoxic, mutagenic, or neutral to the cell. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) depicts the major reactive sites on the DNA bases that are susceptible to alkylation. Cytotoxic lesions block replication, interrupt transcription, or signal the activation of apoptosis, whereas mutagenic ones are miscoding and cause mutations in newly synthesized DNA. The most common type of alkylation is methylation with the major products including N7-methylguanine (7meG), N3-methyladenine (3meA), and O6-methylguanine (O6meG). Smaller amounts of methylation also occurs on other DNA bases, and include the formation of N1-methyladenine (1meA), N3-methylcytosine (3meC), O4-methylthymine (O4meT), and methyl phosphotriesters (MPT).", "When a mutation is caused by an environmental factor or a chemical agent, that agent is called a mutagen. Typical mutagens include chemicals, like those inhaled while smoking, and radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet light, and nuclear radiation. Different mutagens have different modes of damaging DNA and are discussed further in the next section. It is important to note that DNA damage, in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to the formation of a mutation in the DNA. There are elaborate DNA repair processes designed to recognize and repair different types of DNA lesions. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 DNA lesions will result in a DNA mutation. The processes of DNA damage recognition and repair are the focus of later sections within this chapter.\nTypes of Mutations\nThere are a variety of types of mutations. Two major categories of mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations.", ".

By that method, Muller noted that many visible mutations caused by radiation were the same as visible mutations that occurred spontaneously, such as white eyes, small wings, and bobbed bristles. Furthermore, he found that the mutations occurred more frequently in flies exposed to radiation than they did in the untreated flies.", "Muller studied genetic mutations and the structure of chromosomes in fruit flies during the early twentieth century. From 1910 to 1915, Muller worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan, a scientist at Columbia University in New York City, New York, who researched the role chromosomes play in heredity. Chromosomes are structures that consist of DNA, the genetic material of the cell, and are found within a cell's nucleus. While working in Morgan's fly lab, Muller helped discover a class of genes called marker genes, also called genetic markers, that enabled scientists to identify specific places in the genome, even after making changes to particular chromosomes or genes. Muller used genetic markers in his later x-ray experiments that identified mutations in the genome. In the 1920s, Muller studied the role of temperature as a possible mutagen, or cause of genetic mutations. He showed that high temperatures had the capability to mutate genes", "Hermann Joseph Muller's Study of X-rays as a Mutagen, (1926-1927)\nHermann Joseph Muller conducted three experiments in 1926 and 1927 that demonstrated that exposure to x-rays, a form of high-energy radiation, can cause genetic mutations, changes to an organism's genome, particularly in egg and sperm cells. In his experiments, Muller exposed fruit flies (Drosophila) to x-rays, mated the flies, and observed the number of mutations in the offspring. In 1927, Muller described the results of his experiments in \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene\" and \"The Problem of Genic Modification\". His discovery indicated the causes of mutation and for that research he later received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946. Muller's experiments with x-rays established that x-rays mutated genes and that egg and sperm cells are especially susceptible to such genetic mutations.", "In the early 1900s, professionals used x-rays, a form of high-intensity radiation, in the medical, dental, and industrial fields, though they knew little about the long-term effects of exposure to radiation. Many researchers studied how x-rays affected living cells. In 1907, physician Charles Russell Bardeen showed that toad eggs fertilized with sperm he exposed to x-rays resulted in embryos with developmental abnormalities that prevented toad larvae from developing into tadpoles. Experiments like Bardeen's supported Muller's hypothesis that mutations involved changes to individual genes. Muller hypothesized that he could induce genetic mutations using x-rays. Muller performed a series of three experiments in 1926 and 1927 exploring the role of x-rays as a mutagen.", ". Through his work studying the effects of temperature on genetic mutations, Muller developed a method to quantify the number and frequency of mutations which he used in his later experiments with radiation.", "In his 1927 article \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene,\" Muller published his conclusions that exposure to x-rays could cause genetic mutations. However, Muller failed to include complete data and methods of his prior experiments. According to Elof Carlson, a student of Muller, the paper grabbed the attention of geneticists, but many questioned Muller's findings because of the missing data. Later that year Muller released the paper \"The Problem of Genic Modification\" at a genetics conference in Berlin, Germany. His second paper detailed his 1926 and 1927 experiments and provided clarifications that \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene\" lacked. A year after the conference, other scientists confirmed Muller's claims that x-rays led to mutations in both plant and animal chromosomes.", "Muller created over 1,000 cultures of first generation flies whose parents had been subjected to x-rays and a similar amount of control cultures, cultures in which the flies' parents were not subjected to the radiation. By comparing the results of his x-ray experiments with control cultures, Muller confirmed that x-rays caused the genetic mutations and that the mutations did not spontaneously arise, or arise from normal cell function.", "Muller's discovery that x-rays caused genes to mutate had many different implications in various fields. In the field of radiology, Muller's work illuminated previously undocumented dangers of x-rays. His findings showed that x-rays could be particularly harmful to humans in their reproductive years. Radiologists began taking precautions to shield patients from radiation that could cause genetic mutations to sperm and egg cells, possibly affecting later embryo development. In the field of genetics, Muller's work showed that environmental factors like radiation affected heritable characteristics. Furthermore, his discovery enabled scientists to directly induce genetic mutations instead of waiting for mutations to occur spontaneously. For his experiments on the mutagenic effects of x-rays, Muller received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946.\nSources", "To determine whether genetic mutations were induced in a parent exposed to radiation, Muller mated the heterozygous female offspring, which had both bb and sc v f genes, with their sc v f brothers. The male offspring of that cross (grandsons of the irradiated male or female parent) revealed whether or not the x-rays had induced any mutations. Rather than looking for abnormal body parts, Muller determined whether or not mutations had occurred by studying lethal mutations, types of mutations that cause the offspring to die before being born. To identify the lethal mutations, Muller observed the ratio of bb male and sc v f male offspring. If the offspring lacked bb males and only sc v f males were present, Muller reasoned that exposure to radiation induced lethal mutations in the bb genes of male grandparents. Alternatively, if only bb males were present, he reasoned that exposure to radiation induced a lethal mutation in the sc v f female grandparent.", "Building on the results from his first experiment, Muller conducted a second. In the second experiment, Muller used a different type of genetic marker. He used a group of X-linked genes called ClB genes which were lethal to male fruit flies. Through controlled mating, Muller bred a generation of fruit flies in which the male offspring could inherit one of only two kinds of X-chromosomes: ones that had the lethal ClB gene, or ones that had been exposed to radiation in earlier generations. If parent flies radiated in earlier generations had developed lethal mutations in the x chromosomes of their gametes, then mating the files would fail to produce any living male offspring. By counting the number of male and female offspring, Muller inferred the results of mutations caused by radiation. He determined that x-ray exposure caused 150 times more flies to die through a lethal mutation compared to the spontaneous rate of mutations that occurred in the control group.", "Muller then developed a third experiment in the spring of 1927 that specifically looked for visible mutations in the offspring of radiation exposed fruit flies. Muller used females with two X-chromosomes fused together as well as a single, separate Y-chromosome to mate with males with the bb gene that he had also exposed to x-rays. Mating females with fused X-chromosomes leads to an unusual mode of inheritance. Unlike typical sex inheritance, where males inherit their X-chromosome from their mother and their Y-chromosome from their father, mating a female with fused X-chromosomes leads the opposite. Instead, males inherit their X-chromosomes from their father and their Y-chromosome from their mother. Consequently, any non-lethal mutation induced in a male parent can be identified in their sons because their sons inherit their fathers' X-chromosome", "- Muller, Hermann J. \"The Problem of Genic Modification.\" Proceedings of the 5th International Congress 1 (1928): 234\u2013260.\n- Muller, Hermann. \"The Production of Mutations by X-rays\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 14 (1928): 714. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1085688/pdf/pnas01821-0038.pdf\n- Morgan, Thomas Hunt and Calvin B.

The control group showed a lower frequency of the lethal mutations (1 lethal mutation in 947 cultures). Muller concluded that the x-ray exposure caused the lethal mutations in the offspring of the x-ray treated flies. He also found that mutations occurred in both the male and female flies when exposed to x-rays, indicating that both sexes were vulnerable to radiation-induced mutations.", "Muller began his first experiment testing x-rays as a mutagen in 1926 while at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas. In his first experiment, Muller bred flies whose genomes contained particular genetic markers on the X-chromosome, which enabled him to identify mutations. In normal flies, female flies have two X-chromosomes. Male flies, however, have only one X-chromosome and one Y chromosome which does not contain those particular genetic markers. Muller used male flies that contained the X-linked gene, meaning it was located on the X-chromosome, for bobbed bristles (bb) as a genetic marker. The bb gene, led to offspring with noticeable differences in the shape of the flies' sensory bristles compared to normal flies. Muller also used female flies that were homozygous for the X-linked gene sc v f, meaning that both X-chromosomes contained the sc v f gene. The sc v f gene led to offspring with a difference in eye color and distinguishably different sensory bristles", ". Before mating the male and female flies, Muller exposed the flies to x-ray radiation in an attempt to induce genetic mutations in them. Following the x-ray treatment, he mated the flies to produce offspring consisting of heterozygous females, meaning that each female offspring had one X-chromosome with the bb gene and one with the sc v f gene, and male offspring had the sc v f gene. The bb genetic markers were recessive, so the heterozygous females displayed the physical traits associated with the sc v f gene, but still carried the bb gene and, any mutations induced by the radiation in that chromosome."], "title": "Hermann Joseph Muller's Study of X-rays as a Mutagen, (1926-1927)"}, "https://www.healthline.com/health/parkinsons/dopamine-parkinson": {"url": "https://www.healthline.com/health/parkinsons/dopamine-parkinson", "description": "An amino acid called levodopa can help increase levels of dopamine in the brain.

They send information and data through your brain and out into your central nervous system rapidly so you can move and react. However, when these transmitters are interrupted or redirected, symptoms and signs of potential problems can become apparent.\nDopamine is transported through your brain along specific pathways. These are called dopaminergic pathways or dopamine pathways. In people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, two significant dopamine pathways \u2014 the mesolimbic pathway and the nigrostriatal pathway \u2014 stop communicating with other neurons and parts of the brain.\nTypically, these pathways are responsible for moving dopamine from specific parts of the brain.

Dopamine also plays a role in the body\u2019s motivation and reward mechanism.

It can get the building blocks from the foods you eat and the activities you do.

People who don\u2019t get enough sleep may have low levels of dopamine. Aim for 7 to 9 hours a night.\n- Eat protein. Protein-rich foods like meat and dairy contain an amino acid called tyrosine. It plays an important role in dopamine production in the brain. When you eat protein, you provide more of that building block of dopamine. You don\u2019t have to cook up a slab of beef or chicken to reap the rewards of dopamine from food, though. Plant-based proteins like legumes and soy will work, too.\n- Take probiotics.

Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2.

But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "The FLiRT strains are subvariants of Omicron, and together they accounted for the majority of COVID cases in the U.S. at the beginning of July.

As summer began, it was responsible for 14.9% of COVID cases. (The percentages are based on CDC Nowcast estimates, which provide projections that can change as more data is reported.)\nMeanwhile, during the same period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant COVID uptick in several states, based on spikes in emergency room visits and detections of the virus in wastewater.

It often begins in a hand but can start in a foot or the jaw. It features a characteristic rhythmic back-and-forth motion and is most obvious at rest or when under stress. It may also disappear during sleep.", "- DaTscan: This is an imaging technique that determines how much dopamine is available in a person\u2019s brain. It is a specific type of nuclear medicine called\nsingle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) . - MRI or CT scan: These other scans can rule out a stroke or brain tumor, which may cause similar symptoms.\n- Blood tests: A doctor may suggest a blood test to rule out other possible causes, such as liver damage or abnormal thyroid hormone levels.\n- Levodopa test:\nLevodopa (L-Dopa) is the precursor to dopamine and a drug that can boost dopamine levels. If a person displays improved symptoms after taking L-Dopa, it indicates a diagnosis of PD.\nRisk factors for PD may\n- Age: The incidence of PD increases significantly with age.\n- Environment: Exposure to certain pesticides may increase the risk of PD.\n- Genetics: People have an increased risk of developing PD if they have a close relative with the condition.\n- Sex: PD typically affects more men than women.", "Currently there is no cure for PD, however, treatments may help improve symptoms. Treatment options may\n- Medication: Certain drugs may help to either boost dopamine levels, affect other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, or help manage non-motor symptoms such as depression.

Current treatment options include drug therapy, surgery, and complementary therapies.", "As the condition progresses, symptoms may start to interfere more with daily tasks. People may notice that shaking makes it very difficult for them to eat, they struggle getting out of a seat, and they may speak too softly or with hesitation.\nResearchers are still unsure on the precise cause of PD. At present, evidence suggests that it most likely results from a combination of genetics and exposure to environmental factors that trigger the condition.\nScientists have identified that PD occurs when neurons in the brain become impaired or die and start producing less dopamine. However, they are unclear exactly what causes this. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke suggests the following potential causes:\n- Genetics: Several genetic mutations appear to have links with PD. However, researchers do not consider the condition to be hereditary. Research suggests that genetic factors may only account for roughly 10% of cases.", "- Rigidity: This refers to muscle stiffness or difficulty moving. Often, the muscles remain constantly tense, which may cause a person to feel stiff or achy.\n- Bradykinesia: This refers to slow or difficult movement, which can make performing simple tasks difficult. This may mean that routine activities such as washing or dressing now take much longer.\n- Postural instability: Changes in posture and poor balance can increase the risk of falls and potential injuries.\nPeople may not experience PD the same way, and the progression of the condition may also differ among individuals.\nEarly symptoms may be subtle and occur gradually. People may experience mild tremors, start noticing difficulty moving, or realize that tasks begin to take longer to complete. Some may notice that symptoms begin on one side of the body but eventually affect both sides. Symptoms are often less severe on one side than the other.", "- Environment: Exposure to certain toxins, such as MPTP or manganese, may result in the development of PD.

The rate of mutation differs for different genes and organisms. In RNA viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see AIDS), replication of the genome takes place within the host cell using a mechanism that is prone to error. Hence, mutation rates in such viruses are high. In general, however, the fate of individual mutant alleles is never certain. Most are eliminated by chance. In some cases a mutant allele can increase in frequency by chance, and then individuals expressing the allele can be subject to selection, either positive or negative. Hence, for any one gene the frequency of a mutant allele in a population is determined by a combination of mutational pressure, selection, and chance.", ". Hence, a mutation that changes DNA sequence can change amino acid sequence and in this way potentially reduce or inactivate a protein\u2019s function. A change in the DNA sequence of a gene\u2019s regulatory region can adversely affect the timing and availability of the gene\u2019s protein and also lead to serious cellular malfunction. On the other hand, many mutations are silent, showing no obvious effect at the functional level. Some silent mutations are in the DNA between genes, or they are of a type that results in no significant amino acid changes.", "Loss or gain of whole chromosomes results in a condition called aneuploidy. One familiar result of aneuploidy is Down syndrome, a chromosomal disorder in which humans are born with an extra chromosome 21 (and hence bear three copies of that chromosome instead of the usual two). Another type of chromosome mutation is the gain or loss of whole chromosome sets. Gain of sets results in polyploidy\u2014that is, the presence of three, four, or more chromosome sets instead of the usual two. Polyploidy has been a significant force in the evolution of new species of plants and animals. (See also evolution: Polyploidy.)\nMost genomes contain mobile DNA elements that move from one location to another. The movement of these elements can cause mutation, either because the element arrives in some crucial location, such as within a gene, or because it promotes large-scale chromosome mutations via recombination between pairs of mobile elements in different locations.", "Mutations are of several types. Changes within genes are called point mutations. The simplest kinds are changes to single base pairs, called base-pair substitutions. Many of these substitute an incorrect amino acid in the corresponding position in the encoded protein, and of these a large proportion result in altered protein function. Some base-pair substitutions produce a stop codon. Normally, when a stop codon occurs at the end of a gene, it stops protein synthesis, but, when it occurs in an abnormal position, it can result in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. Another type of simple change, the deletion or insertion of single base pairs, generally has a profound effect on the protein because the protein\u2019s synthesis, which is carried out by the reading of triplet codons in a linear fashion from one end of the gene to the other, is thrown off. This change leads to a frameshift in reading the gene such that all amino acids are incorrect from the mutation onward", "Mutations that span more than one gene are called chromosomal mutations because they affect the structure, function, and inheritance of whole DNA molecules (microscopically visible in a coiled state as chromosomes). Often these chromosome mutations result from one or more coincident breaks in the DNA molecules of the genome (possibly from exposure to energetic radiation), followed in some cases by faulty rejoining. Some outcomes are large-scale deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. In a diploid species (a species, such as human beings, that has a double set of chromosomes in the nucleus of each cell), deletions and duplications alter gene balance and often result in abnormality. Inversions and translocations involve no loss or gain and are functionally normal unless a break occurs within a gene. However, at meiosis (the specialized nuclear divisions that take place during the production of gametes\u2014i.e", ". More-complex combinations of base substitutions, insertions, and deletions can also be observed in some mutant genes.", ". Mutations result either from accidents during the normal chemical transactions of DNA, often during replication, or from exposure to high-energy electromagnetic radiation (e.g., ultraviolet light or X-rays) or particle radiation or to highly reactive chemicals in the environment. Because mutations are random changes, they are expected to be mostly deleterious, but some may be beneficial in certain environments. In general, mutation is the main source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for evolution by natural selection.", "The genome is composed of one to several long molecules of DNA, and mutation can occur potentially anywhere on these molecules at any time. The most serious changes take place in the functional units of DNA, the genes. A mutated form of a gene is called a mutantallele. A gene is typically composed of a regulatory region, which is responsible for turning the gene\u2019s transcription on and off at the appropriate times during development, and a coding region, which carries the genetic code for the structure of a functional molecule, generally a protein. A protein is a chain of usually several hundred amino acids. Cells make 20 common amino acids, and it is the unique number and sequence of these that give a protein its specific function. Each amino acid is encoded by a unique sequence, or codon, of three of the four possible base pairs in the DNA (A\u2013T, T\u2013A, G\u2013C, and C\u2013G, the individual letters referring to the four nitrogenous bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine)", "mutation, an alteration in the genetic material (the genome) of a cell of a living organism or of a virus that is more or less permanent and that can be transmitted to the cell\u2019s or the virus\u2019s descendants.

The acronym for the enzyme is also MTHFR. It\u2019s worth knowing about this gene because it plays a key role with regard to many aspects of emotional and physical health.\nWho Should Know About MTHFR?", "This post may be of greatest interest to those who have been diagnosed with one of the mental health issues linked to having an MTHFR mutation, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism. MTHFR mutations also increase the risk of several physical health problems, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease and stroke, recurrent early miscarriage, migraine with aura, osteoporosis, and some cancers. So, it\u2019s worth knowing about this mutation even if one or more of the above conditions run in your family.\nResponse to Drugs", "As you may remember from biology class, genes are pieces of our DNA that control a specific characteristic (such as hair or eye color, etc.). Each gene is made up of two alleles, or specific forms of that gene. In short, genes and their alleles determine what traits we inherit from our ancestors. Sometimes these traits are obvious, such as having blue vs. brown eyes. Other times, the result of a specific trait may not be immediately obvious, such as whether we will like or detest the herb cilantro, metabolize caffeine quickly or slowly, or have increased or decreased risk of a health problem down the road.\nA mutation is a naturally occurring process that causes a specific variation on one or more alleles of a particular gene, changing a sequence in our DNA. Having a mutation on both alleles at a specific location on a gene is generally associated with a greater impact than if only one of a pair of alleles is different from normal.\nHow Common Are MTHFR Mutations?", "By some estimates, up to 40% of the population may have an MTHFR mutation of some kind. The current data suggest that between 6 and 14% of Caucasians and about 2% of those of African descent probably have a more severe (two mutated alleles) version of the mutation. In Hispanics, this number may be as high as 21%.\nBut even having one mutated allele is associated with an increased risk of certain health problems. For example, having one mutated allele at either of two specific locations is associated with 20-40% reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme (depending on where on the gene the mutation is found). Having two mutated alleles at the same location is associated with a 40-70% reduction in enzyme activity, again, with severity depending upon the location of the mutated alleles. Some people may have two mutated alleles \u2013 one at each of two different locations on the gene \u2014 and that also increases risk of a number of health issues.\nHow Does This Gene Impact Health?", "The presence of an MTHFR mutation can also alter one\u2019s response to medications, including antidepressants and some chemotherapy drugs. Further, it can increase the risk of having an adverse reaction to receiving nitrous oxide anesthesia (a common dental anesthetic). Therefore, individuals with an MTHFR mutation should speak with their physicians/dentists prior to undergoing any procedure that would require anesthesia.\nA Quick, Basic Genetics Overview", "In addition to having an MTHFR mutation, there are other factors associated with decreased folate levels or poor absorption, including malnutrition, gastrointestinal illness, and high alcohol consumption. If you have an MTHFR mutation and/or one of the above issues, it is important to know that you will have reduced ability to metabolize folic acid, the synthetic form of folate that is found in processed foods (e.g., breads, cereals) and vitamins.\nWhat You Can Do\nThere are some simple and inexpensive steps one can take to reduce the risks associated with MTHFR mutations, possibly improve response to antidepressant therapies, and feel better in general:", "Normally, the MTHFR gene produces enough of the related enzyme to perform its associated functions well. One function that is particularly important to mental health is the conversion of an essential B-vitamin, folate, into the more usable form, l-methylfolate.\nL-Methylfolate enables our bodies to convert the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body then uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds, including neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). These brain chemicals are essential for a number of aspects of mental health; thus, when this process is impaired, it can increase the likelihood of the mental health issues mentioned previously. In addition, when the enzyme is not working at normal capacity, it can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular and other health problems.", "Despite the increased risks, however, having a specific MTHFR mutation has been associated with a reduced risk of acute lymphatic leukemia and colon cancer in those who have adequate folate levels.\nThe good news is that the risk of a variety of health problems is increased in those with MTHFR mutations, but thankfully, developing these problems is not guaranteed. If you have a personal or significant family history of one or more of the above illnesses, and in particular, if you have not responded as well as expected to conventional treatment for depression or other mental health issues, it is worth speaking with your medical provider about being tested for an MTHFR mutation. The preliminary research on MTHFR, autism, and ADHD suggest that adequate prenatal intake of folate \u2013 both in the period 3 months before conception and during the first month of pregnancy in particular \u2014 can reduce these risks.\nOther Factors That Interfere With Folate Metabolism and Increase Health Risks"], "title": "A Genetic Mutation That Can Affect Mental & Physical Health"}, "https://www.salk.edu/news-release/flipping-the-switch-salk-scientists-shed-new-light-on-genetic-changes-that-turn-on-cancer-genes/": {"url": "https://www.salk.edu/news-release/flipping-the-switch-salk-scientists-shed-new-light-on-genetic-changes-that-turn-on-cancer-genes/", "description": "Most genetic mutations have no impact on a cancer and the molecular incidents that lead to oncogene activation are relatively rare.

While 20% to 50% of people with PD will experience mild cognitive impairment, not all lead to a dementia diagnosis.\nTwo long-term studies suggest that many people with PD will eventually develop a mild form of dementia as the disease progresses, usually many years after their initial diagnosis. One medication, Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate), can treat dementia in PD. Other medications are being studied.\nWhat causes cognitive changes in people with PD?\nOne cause is a drop in the level of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating the body\u2019s movements. However, the cognitive changes associated with dopamine declines are typically mild and restricted.", "Cognitive Changes\nSome people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) experience mild cognitive impairment. Feelings of distraction or disorganization can accompany cognitive impairment, along with finding it difficult to plan and accomplish tasks.\nIt may be harder to focus in situations that divide your attention, like a group conversation. When facing a task or situation on their own, a person with PD may feel overwhelmed by having to make choices. They may also have difficulty remembering information or have trouble finding the right words when speaking. These changes can range from being annoying to interfering with managing household affairs.\nTo some degree, cognitive impairment affects many people with PD. The same brain changes that lead to motor symptoms can also result in slowness in memory and thinking. Stress, medication and depression can also contribute to these changes.", "When reporting symptoms of mild cognitive impairment, the doctor will first want to rule out causes other than PD, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency, depression, fatigue or sleep disturbances. It should be noted that PD does not cause sudden changes in mental functioning. If a sudden change occurs, the cause is likely to be something else, such as a medication side-effect.\nIf cognitive symptoms are traceable to PD, there are drug therapies available. Though developed for Alzheimer\u2019s, these medications have been found to have some effect in PD. These include rivastigmine (the only medication approved by the FDA for dementia in PD), donepezil and galantamine. In addition, a person with attention difficulties that are due to daytime sleepiness may benefit from stimulants.\nHow are cognitive problems treated?", "Much remains to be learned about the basic biology that underlies cognitive changes in PD.

Areas most often affected include:\nHow are cognitive issues diagnosed?\nCommon ways to assess and diagnose cognitive disorders:\n- Interview the person with PD.\n- Ask family members or care partners about their observations.\n- Administer cognitive screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). The neurologist will ask questions that evaluate the person\u2019s understanding of where and who they are, the date and year, attention, memory, language and problem-solving skills.", "What co-existing conditions affect thinking and memory?\nThere are other factors that can have a negative impact on a person\u2019s cognitive skills, such as disorders of mood, anxiety and sleep. In some cases, these factors can make memory and thinking deficits worse, as well as directly affect a person\u2019s quality of life.\nSome medications used to treat PD have also been shown to have stimulating effects on thinking and energy levels (like selegiline (Eldepryl\u00ae) and amantadine).\nSeeking Help for Cognitive Changes\nCognitive change is a sensitive issue. In fact, the doctor is often as hesitant to address this subject as the person with PD is to ask about it. Sometimes, the doctor will delay discussing cognitive impairment out of concern for the person who is still coping with the shock of a new PD diagnosis or struggling with motor symptoms.", "Symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often do not interfere with home and work life. They may not even be noticeable, but can be detected through testing. Doctors used to believe that cognitive changes did not develop until middle to late-stage PD, but recent research suggests that mild changes may be present at the time of diagnosis.\nTell your doctor if you have concerns about cognitive changes. You may need to change your medication or see a neurologist or neuropsychologist for assessment. An occupational therapist can also help you find strategies for adapting and coping with these symptoms. A speech therapist can help with language difficulties.\nIn general, mental and motor decline tend to occur together as the disease progresses. Significant cognitive impairment in PD is often associated with:\n- Caregiver distress\n- Worse day-to-day function\n- Diminished quality of life\n- Poorer treatment outcomes\n- Greater medical costs due to nursing home placements\n- Increased mortality", "- If the person is searching for a word, provide a cue, such as, \u201cthe word you are looking for probably begins with \u2018d\u2019.\u201d\n- Do not finish the sentences of a person who needs more time to put them together.\n- When presenting the person with a list of actions, first verbalize them, then write them down.\n- Ask questions to moderate the conversation pace and allow catch up and reinforcement.\nPage reviewed by Dr. Kathryn P Moore, Movement Disorders neurologist at Duke Health, a Parkinson's Foundation Center of Excellence.", "- A neurologist may suggest seeing a clinical neuropsychologist for a more detailed assessment.\n- Neuropsychological assessment can be an important diagnostic tool for differentiating PD from other illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke or dementia.\nHow are cognitive changes in PD different than Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\nOverall, dementia produces a greater impact on social and occupational functioning in PD than Alzheimer\u2019s due to the combination of motor and cognitive impairments.\nThere is some overlap between symptoms and biological changes seen in Alzheimer\u2019s and PD. However, it is less likely for both disorders to occur at the same time. Development of dementia in people with PD represents progression of the disease, usually after several years of motor impairment.\nDementia may or may not occur in people with PD.
