From 1910 to 1915, Muller worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan, a scientist at Columbia University in New York City, New York, who researched the role chromosomes play in heredity. Chromosomes are structures that consist of DNA, the genetic material of the cell, and are found within a cell's nucleus. While working in Morgan's fly lab, Muller helped discover a class of genes called marker genes, also called genetic markers, that enabled scientists to identify specific places in the genome, even after making changes to particular chromosomes or genes. Muller used genetic markers in his later x-ray experiments that identified mutations in the genome. In the 1920s, Muller studied the role of temperature as a possible mutagen, or cause of genetic mutations. He showed that high temperatures had the capability to mutate genes", "In his 1927 article \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene,\" Muller published his conclusions that exposure to x-rays could cause genetic mutations. However, Muller failed to include complete data and methods of his prior experiments. According to Elof Carlson, a student of Muller, the paper grabbed the attention of geneticists, but many questioned Muller's findings because of the missing data. Later that year Muller released the paper \"The Problem of Genic Modification\" at a genetics conference in Berlin, Germany. His second paper detailed his 1926 and 1927 experiments and provided clarifications that \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene\" lacked. A year after the conference, other scientists confirmed Muller's claims that x-rays led to mutations in both plant and animal chromosomes.", "Hermann Joseph Muller's Study of X-rays as a Mutagen, (1926-1927)\nHermann Joseph Muller conducted three experiments in 1926 and 1927 that demonstrated that exposure to x-rays, a form of high-energy radiation, can cause genetic mutations, changes to an organism's genome, particularly in egg and sperm cells. In his experiments, Muller exposed fruit flies (Drosophila) to x-rays, mated the flies, and observed the number of mutations in the offspring. In 1927, Muller described the results of his experiments in \"Artificial Transmutation of the Gene\" and \"The Problem of Genic Modification\". His discovery indicated the causes of mutation and for that research he later received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946.

Through his work studying the effects of temperature on genetic mutations, Muller developed a method to quantify the number and frequency of mutations which he used in his later experiments with radiation.", "To determine whether genetic mutations were induced in a parent exposed to radiation, Muller mated the heterozygous female offspring, which had both bb and sc v f genes, with their sc v f brothers. The male offspring of that cross (grandsons of the irradiated male or female parent) revealed whether or not the x-rays had induced any mutations. Rather than looking for abnormal body parts, Muller determined whether or not mutations had occurred by studying lethal mutations, types of mutations that cause the offspring to die before being born. To identify the lethal mutations, Muller observed the ratio of bb male and sc v f male offspring. If the offspring lacked bb males and only sc v f males were present, Muller reasoned that exposure to radiation induced lethal mutations in the bb genes of male grandparents. Alternatively, if only bb males were present, he reasoned that exposure to radiation induced a lethal mutation in the sc v f female grandparent.", "Muller began his first experiment testing x-rays as a mutagen in 1926 while at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas. In his first experiment, Muller bred flies whose genomes contained particular genetic markers on the X-chromosome, which enabled him to identify mutations. In normal flies, female flies have two X-chromosomes. Male flies, however, have only one X-chromosome and one Y chromosome which does not contain those particular genetic markers. Muller used male flies that contained the X-linked gene, meaning it was located on the X-chromosome, for bobbed bristles (bb) as a genetic marker. The bb gene, led to offspring with noticeable differences in the shape of the flies' sensory bristles compared to normal flies. Muller also used female flies that were homozygous for the X-linked gene sc v f, meaning that both X-chromosomes contained the sc v f gene.

If these concerns disrupt your usual functioning, it\u2019s a clear sign to consult a healthcare professional. There are numerous options available, including counseling, lifestyle changes, adjusting Parkinson\u2019s medications, or incorporating new treatments, offering effective ways to manage these issues without suffering in silence. Keep track of these concerns and changes so you can inform your doctor of what you\u2019re experiencing, and how often.

The mental health issue may not be solvable, but it could be made better by a lifestyle modification, medication adjustment, new medication or even a clinical trial.\n- Don\u2019t wait for your doctor to ask. Because there are so many different symptoms that can manifest in PD, your doctor may be focused elsewhere (e.g. on your tremor, your blood pressure, or your sleep). At any particular visit, your doctor may not bring up cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, or psychosis. So bring it up yourself \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate to address what\u2019s important to you.\n- Do not crowd the visit with a mention of every PD-related symptom that you have.

These are called dopaminergic pathways or dopamine pathways.

It can get the building blocks from the foods you eat and the activities you do.

In psychology, it\u2019s linked to feelings of gratification and is implicated in mood disorders, addiction, and certain behaviors when its levels are imbalanced.\nWhilst strongly involved in pleasure and rewards, dopamine is also involved in other functions:\n-\nMotor function and movement\n-\nMood regulation\n-\nExecutive functioning\n-\nMemory and focus\n-\nSleep\n-\nDigestion and blood flow\nIt is important to note that dopamine does not act in isolation. It works with other neurotransmitters and hormones, such as serotonin and adrenaline, to perform a variety of functions.", "Dopamine appears to play a big role in the activity of the frontal and temporal lobes, particularly parts of the cerebral cortex of these lobes that play a role in the cognitive, emotional, and perceptual functions that are often abnormal in schizophrenia.\nHowever, inconsistencies in post-mortem findings and debates on whether certain changes were due to drugs or the disease made it challenging to pinpoint schizophrenia\u2019s exact link with dopamine. Yet, imaging studies revealed that schizophrenic patients release more dopamine than healthy individuals in response to certain scenarios (Laruelle et al., 1996).\nThe discovery of organic changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients through imaging techniques shifted the focus to viewing schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "Dopamine is a catecholamine, a class of neurotransmitter which also includes epinephrine and norepinephrine. It was believed to be first identified in the brain by Kathleen Montagu in her 1957 paper demonstrating findings on key neurotransmitters.\nAs part of her research, she examined the quantities of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and 3-hydroxytryramine from extracted brain tissues of several species.\nMontagu speculated that there might be an additional catecholamine similar to hydroxytyramine, which she later confirmed to be what is known as dopamine. Arvid Carlsson published research in the same year that confirmed dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain, as opposed to another precursor molecule.\nDopamine is highly concentrated in areas of the brain called the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain. Other brain areas where dopamine can be made are the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb.", "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that serves as a chemical messenger in the brain. It can function as both an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter, leading to diverse effects on the brain, body, and behavior.\nDopamine is primarily known to be associated with feelings of pleasure and rewards. This chemical can also contribute to feelings of:\n-\nAlertness\n-\nFocus\n-\nMotivation\n-\nHappiness\nDopamine is released when the brain is anticipating a reward. The flood of dopamine to the brain when experiencing a pleasurable stimulus (e.g., delicious food, video games, sex) can reinforce wanting to engage with this stimulus more due to the pleasurable feeling it causes.\nThis is a cycle of motivation, reward, and reinforcement. When associating a certain activity with pleasure, sometimes even mere anticipation may be enough to raise dopamine levels."], "title": "Dopamine Function in the Brain - Simply Psychology"}}}
