These studies help show whether a treatment is safe and effective in people. Some people join clinical trials to help doctors and researchers learn more about a disease and improve health care. Other people, such as those with health conditions, join to try treatments that aren\u2019t widely available.", "Because direct-to-consumer genetic reports for mental disorders are not accompanied by a health care provider\u2019s guidance, their results should be interpreted cautiously. These reports have varying levels of scientific support, may or may not be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and can be misleading.

While the use of DSM-5 diagnostic terms allowed for meaningful comparison across mental disorder types, and ensured the dataset was not overwhelmed by non-clinical references to terms such as \u2018anxiety\u2019 and \u2018addiction\u2019, results were affected by some diagnostic terms being more widely used than others. For example, the terms \u201canorexia nervosa\u201d and \u201cphobia\u201d were used relatively faithfully, but the number of articles recovered about substance addiction was low due to infrequent lay use of formal diagnostic terms like \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d. Similarly, the mood disorder category was more representative of bipolar disorder than major depressive disorder due to greater commonality of the term \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d than \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d in everyday language.

Keyword searches of a news media database identified 1,892 articles published between March 2018 to March 2022 that mentioned one of six categories of mental disorders: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance-related disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and psychotic disorders.

However this is appropriate for an initial exploratory study. This descriptive data is vital to inform future ecologically valid, hypothesis-driven research, for example regarding the influence of COVID-19 on attributions or the differential effects of various social attributions.\nConclusions", "As social attributions are much more frequent in real-world discourse about mental disorders than currently represented in attribution research, they merit more direct theoretical and empirical elaboration on their own terms, rather than as merely a foil or control for biological attributions. While most previous research has collapsed social explanations into a single unidimensional category, the current data illuminates the multi-layered nature of attributions to social causes. Articles invoked determinants that traversed multiple \u2018levels\u2019 of the social world: from individual biographies to interpersonal relations, family dynamics, socio-economic factors and cultural context. Research from other domains suggests that different social determinants can trigger variable degrees of social essentialism, and hence more negative intergroup attitudes ", "(The Irish Times, 21/10/2020)\nSome articles also included generic mentions of \u201cenvironmental factors\u201d, presumably representing life experience generally, as being responsible for mental disorders (n = 6).\nSchizophrenia and other psychotic conditions are now known to arise from a complex interplay of genes and environment\u2026\n(Irish Daily Mail, 19/03/2019)\nThe cultural/societal environment.\nAspects of one\u2019s social environment were also commonly described as being responsible for mental disorders (16.40%, n = 103).\nCultural/societal expectations were one example of this (n = 56). This included perceived pressure from those around oneself to appear or behave in certain ways, including gender expectations, education and employment pressures, expectations around physical appearance and fitness, and expectations associated with fame and being in the public eye.", ". The relationships between biological attributions and negative social outcomes have been observed in both cross-sectional  and experimental  research, with the latter demonstrating that causal beliefs can be manipulated by exposure to experimentally-presented causal explanations.", "Public beliefs about the causes of mental illness have important implications for people with mental health difficulties. For instance, the belief that biological factors are responsible for mental illness has been shown to be associated with greater stigmatising attitudes, such as desire for social distance or perceptions of dangerousness . Exposure to information about mental illness that circulates in public discourse, such as through news media, can sway public opinion , and in the past has contributed to the formation of negative attitudes and harmful stereotypes . Exploring how causal explanations are disseminated in real-world contexts can provide insight into how members of the public encounter such information, and consequently, how their understandings may be shaped", "As a major societal event, the COVID-19 pandemic offers a good test-case to explore the malleability of causal attributions across socio-cultural context. The analysis produced some tentative evidence of temporal changes in attribution patterns post-pandemic, most notably a sharp rise in attributions to interpersonal relations, which included factors such as loneliness and social isolation. Along with prior research , this finding suggests that the pandemic may have increased public sensitivity to the social causes of mental disorders, though the durability of such effects remains to be seen. This emphasises the importance of situating research on causal attributions within their cultural/societal environment, and diversifying the geographic and historical evidence-base from which conclusions about attributions\u2019 trends and effects are drawn.\nStrengths and limitations", "This study uses content analysis to identify the causal explanations for various mental disorders, and their prevalence, in major print and online news media in Ireland. The paper builds on previous literature by revealing the ways in which the public are exposed to causal explanations of mental disorders, paying particular attention to representations of social determinants, which are under-researched in previous literature. It also illuminates differences in news representations across mental disorders type by comparing across six categories of mental disorders. Finally, it investigates the malleability of attributions by exploring whether they shifted following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with a \u2018cultural meanings\u2019 rather than \u2018deficit model\u2019 approach to lay understandings , the concern is not with evaluating the accuracy or \u2018truth\u2019 of public attributions, but documenting their range, prevalence, and distribution across time and mental disorder category.\nMethods"], "title": "How does the public understand the causes of mental disorders ... - PLOS"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant", "description": "COVID-19 portal. v. t. e.

Not all of its 550 pages are relevant to CICM exams, and one could safely limit one's reading to just the headline chapter (\"Neurotransmitter systems and functions: overview\"). If one is really interested, one could get a hold of Kumar & Deb's cowboy-sounding Frontiers in Pharmacology", "Question 1(p.2) from the first paper of 2010 asked for \"the physiological basis of the effects seen in the serotonin syndrome\", which appears to be a question none of the trainees could answer. This makes perfect sense, as the international scientific community is still unclear on this, and Francescageli et al, writing in 2019, did not report any clearly established molecular mechanisms. The college answer itself is also weirdly lacking in detail, offering irrelevant factoids like \"important neurotransmitter, a local hormone in the GIT and involved in platelet reactions\" and listing some clinical features but not explaining them other than to say that \"in serotonin syndrome these effects are probably CNS mediated\"", "So, depending on which receptor system is activated, the effects of dopamine could be excitatory or inhibitory. The increase or decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP could also lead to conflicting membrane effects. For example, D1 receptor secondary messenger signalling produces an inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase activity, which should have a depolarising effect by making the resting membrane potential less negative (Pirovarov et al, 2019). D2 effects, on the other hand, seem to be mainly \"inhibitory\", as they produce a hyperpolarisation of the membrane by the modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels (Maurice et al, 2004). Moreover D2 receptors are available in presynaptic and postsynaptic flavours, each with distinct effects (presynaptic ones, for example, inhibit further dopamine release by a negative feedback mechanism, whereas postsynaptic ones can actually enhance downstream dopamine release). In short, you can't call dopamine an excitatory or an inhibitory neurotransmitter", "However, when one thinks of scenarios where dopamine neurotransmission is in excess, one thinks of a patient cavorting around their room in the nude. For the intensivist, the most important physiological roles of dopamine neurotransmission are related to its effects on movement, arousal and behaviour. In summary:\nRole of dopamine in movement relates to the regulatory role of dopamine in the nigrostriatal region of the basal ganglia. From here, projections to the rest of the basal ganglia are involved in the control of voluntary movement and coordination. Interference with dopaminergic neurotransmission here can lead to a paucity of movement (Parkinson disease) or its excess (tardive dyskinesia).\nRole of dopamine in alertness and consciousness: Dopaminergic neurotransmission is crucially important to all sorts of complex prefrontal functions such as learning, working memory, aggression, emotion, motor control, and food intake.", "Noradrenaline is also a catecholamine neurotransmitter that will be better known to ICU trainees because it has historical relevance for the treatment of shock, and because it remains a widely available vasopressor/inotrope, still in clinical use worldwide. The synthesis and structure of dopamine, as well as its catecholamine daughter molecules, is discussed better in the chapters about the autonomic nervous system. There are multiple dopamine receptors, all of which are metabotropic:"], "title": "Synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter systems - Deranged Physiology"}, "https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-public-mental-health": {"url": "https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-public-mental-health", "description": "Public mental health (PMH) seeks to answer questions like these by taking a broad, holistic approach to understanding, treating, and preventing mental and behavioral health disorders in populations, says Lindsey Webb, PhD \u201920, MHS \u201916, assistant research professor in Mental Health.
