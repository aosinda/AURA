This discovery, which was first published in 2024 and has since been updated, highlights the complexity of genetics in mental health and has the potential to redefine how we diagnose and treat these disorders.\n\nThe DAT-K619N variant is a specific mutation in the gene that codes for the dopamine transporter protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating dopamine levels in the brain. This variant has been found to be present in individuals with multiple disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This suggests that this single genetic anomaly could have a significant impact on the development of these disorders.\n\nIn addition, this finding has implications for future treatments and preventative measures for mental health disorders. With more research, we may see genetically tailored therapies that target this specific variant, potentially leading to more effective treatments. This could also lead to the development of preventative measures for individuals who are genetically predisposed to these disorders.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this discovery also raises ethical concerns and could lead to debates on genetic determinism in mental health. The danger of oversimplifying complex conditions to a single genetic cause should also be considered. Further research and collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and patients will be essential in understanding the full impact of this discovery on the scientific community and those affected by mental health disorders.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it's also worth noting that the virus is continuing to evolve and find new ways to infect and reinfect the population.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

CDC has recommended the updated 2024\u20132025 COVID-19 vaccines, once authorized or approved by FDA, to protect against severe disease this fall and winter.\nKP.3.1.1 is the predominant variant as COVID-19 activity increases\nKP.3.1.1, of the Omicron family, is the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant among many currently co-circulating JN.1-derived variants in the United States.\nFor the two-week period ending August 17, KP.3.1.1 is predicted to account for between 31% and 43% of COVID-19 clinical specimens, compared to between 20% and 26% for the two-week period ending August 3.", "Since the end of March, KP.3 lineage viruses have been rising, and in early June, they overtook KP.2 as the dominant variants. Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time. Some variants emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.", "New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge. CDC closely tracks the numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States and globally. Our teams use multiple sources of genomic data from CDC, public health laboratories, and commercial diagnostic laboratories, to identify and monitor the spread of variants. Through detection and tracking of new variants, CDC is able to support outbreak preparedness and prevention efforts.\nAgain, KP.3.1.1 descended from KP.3, which descended from the Omicron family. Since the original Omicron variant first emerged in the fall of 2021, Omicron offshoots such as BA.5 and XBB.1.5 have become predominant and then subsequently replaced by other variants in the Omicron family.\nCOVID-19 activity remains elevated", "Early indicators such as test positivity rose to 18.3% for the week ending August 10, from 17.9% the week before. Emergency department visits diagnosed as COVID-19 have been rising since mid-May, initially in the West and now with the South and Southeast showing the highest levels. The wastewater viral activity level for COVID-19 has been rising since mid-May and is currently very high across most parts of the country.\nHospitalizations due to COVID-19, an indication of disease severity, have also been rising, albeit modestly. For the week ending July 27, the hospitalization rate was 4.0 per 100,000 people, compared to 3.3 per 100,000 people the week prior.\nBeing up to date with the COVID-19 vaccine can protect you", "CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for all people ages 6 months and older to protect against serious illness from COVID-19. People who are up-to-date on vaccination have lower risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 than people who are unvaccinated or who have not received the recommended doses.\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccines that can provide protection during the 2024\u20132025 respiratory virus season will be available in the fall. Until then, those who have never been vaccinated, or are eligible for another dose, like adults ages 65 years and older and people with weakened immune systems, can talk to their healthcare provider about the currently available 2023\u20132024 COVID-19 vaccine.", "People considering getting a 2023-2024 vaccine this year should talk with their healthcare provider to determine if this would delay their ability to get the updated 2024-2025 vaccine. For people ages 65 years and older and people with weakened immune systems, a several-month gap between vaccine doses may be recommended. CDC does not expect any major changes to this recommendation for the time between a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine and a 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine but is awaiting guidance from the FDA. CDC has recommended the updated 2024\u20132025 COVID-19 vaccines, once authorized or approved by FDA, to protect against severe disease this fall and winter."], "title": "KP.3.1.1 is the Predominant Variant as COVID-19 Activity Increases"}]}]}, {"perspective": "Ethicist or Bioethicist: This editor will discuss the ethical considerations of attributing mental health disorders to a single genetic mutation.

It contains mutations A222V and Y145H in its spike protein, not considered of particular concern. It has been suggested that AY.4.2 might be 10-15% more transmissible than the original Delta variant.

This additional growth rate would grow with increasing prevalence. Without AY.4.2 and no other changes, the number of cases in the UK would have been about 10% lower.

Another reason was that they identified 48 clusters of B.1.617.2, some of which revealed a degree of community transmission. With cases from the Delta variant having risen quickly, British scientists considered the Delta variant having overtaken the Alpha variant as the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK in early June 2021.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nThe good news is that in the early spring of 2024, COVID-19 cases were down, with far fewer infections and hospitalizations than were seen in the previous winter. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "Information provided in Yale Medicine articles is for general informational purposes only. No content in the articles should ever be used as a substitute for medical advice from your doctor or other qualified clinician. Always seek the individual advice of your health care provider with any questions you have regarding a medical condition.", "We know the FLiRT variants have two mutations on their spike proteins (the spike-shaped protrusions on the surface of the virus) that weren\u2019t seen on JN.1 (the previously dominant strain in the U.S.). Some experts say these mutations could make it easier for the virus to evade people\u2019s immunity\u2014from the vaccine or a previous bout of COVID.\nWhile more research is needed, experts suspect that the LB.1 strain and another variant called KP.2.3, which also has the two FLiRT mutations plus an additional one, may be more transmissible as well.\nBut, the fact that the variants are otherwise genetically similar to JN.1 should be reassuring, Dr. Roberts says. \"While JN.1 occurred during the winter months, when people gather indoors and the virus is more likely to spread, its symptoms were milder than those caused by variants in the early years of the pandemic,\" he says.", "\u201cI would especially recommend anyone who qualifies for the vaccine because of advanced age get it if they haven\u2019t already,\u201d Dr. Roberts adds. \u201cThe reason is that the biggest risk factor for a bad outcome from COVID is advanced age.\u201d Anyone over age 65 is eligible for both the first updated vaccine offered in the fall of 2023, and a second shot four months later.\nHe also says COVID tests should be able to detect strains related to JN.1, and antiviral treatments should remain effective against them. Paxlovid, the primary treatment for most people with COVID, acts on a \u201cnonspiked part of the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's relatively variant-proof, so it should really act against many future COVID iterations.\u201d\nOther preventive efforts can help. You can avoid getting too close to people who are sick, mask strategically, wash hands properly, improve ventilation, and stay aware of COVID transmission levels where you live and work. Additional strategies are available on the CDC website.", "To better understand how the FLiRT strains emerged, it might help to see how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed over time, with new variants forming as mutations emerged in its genetic code. Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2. What do we know\u2014and not know\u2014about the FLiRT and LB.1 variants?", "\u201cViruses mutate all the time, so I\u2019m not surprised to see a new coronavirus variant taking over,\u201d says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. If anything, he says the new mutations are confirmation that the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a bit of a wild card, where it\u2019s always difficult to predict what it will do next. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing it will continue to mutate.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest question, Dr. Roberts says, is whether the newly mutated virus will continue to evolve before the winter, when infections and hospitalizations usually rise, and if a new fall COVID vaccine will target them.\nBelow, Dr. Roberts answers three questions about the FLiRT variants.\n1.

This variant is found in the gene that encodes for the dopamine transporter, which is responsible for regulating the levels of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in a variety of mental health disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and bipolar disorder. This discovery emphasizes the complexity of genetics in mental health and suggests potential genetic links between different disorders.\n\nThe DAT-K619N variant was first identified in a study published in Nature Communications in 2014, where researchers found that individuals with this variant had a higher risk of developing ADHD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. This discovery was significant because it showed that a single genetic mutation could have a significant impact on multiple disorders, rather than being limited to a specific disorder. It also highlights the need for further research to understand the role of genetics in mental health disorders.\n\nThis variant has also been linked to increased risk of substance abuse and addiction, as dopamine is involved in the reward system of the brain. This further emphasizes the importance of understanding the genetic basis of mental health disorders and the potential for personalized treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that while the DAT-K619N variant may increase the risk of developing certain mental health disorders, it is not the sole cause. Environmental and social factors also play a significant role in the development of these disorders.\n\nThe discovery of the DAT-K619N variant has sparked discussions and debates on genetic determinism in mental health and the potential danger of oversimplifying complex conditions to a single genetic cause.

Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

People with disabilities aren\u2019t necessarily always able to be independent. By the very nature of capitalism, the person who depends on others, who lives with others, or who isn\u2019t an efficient worker is considered to be a failure.\nHow might that manifest today?\nSomething that really affects people is the idea that they can\u2019t live up to capitalist values.

She got an internship at CVS, so the employer and my wife and I went over her duties. Isabel said, \u201cWhen I get here in the morning, I\u2019m a cleaning lady.\u201d The employer snapped at her and said, \u201cYou are not a cleaning lady\u2014you are a retail associate!\u201d", "We\u2019re also appreciating remote work. We\u2019re starting to value stay-at-home parents more, and stay-at-home dads, which used to be considered weird. Why is that important? Being able to value a stay-at-home dad is to say that you are not necessarily disabled if you are not engaged in wage labor. You\u2019re not a bad person if you\u2019re not the sole breadwinner. The person with the disability who lives with their family, who doesn\u2019t move out at the arbitrary age of 18, isn\u2019t seen as violating some set of social rules. The disability rights movement, which includes the rights of people to have new identities, is also expanding the view that we all exist on a spectrum and that we can change over time. Being human means having some fluidity and change. Our views of mental illness are following that as well. It\u2019s this openness and fluidity that I see as the tide that\u2019s raising all boats.", "When capitalism took hold, we started to value individual autonomy and productivity for everybody.

They were idle, they didn\u2019t work, or they were criminals. The asylums didn\u2019t separate people into these different categories; they were all just the idle.

Extensive meta-analytic evidence has found that while biological attributions for mental illness are associated with reduced blame towards people with mental illness, they are also associated with greater perceived dangerousness, greater desire for social distance, and greater prognostic pessimism than social attributions for mental illness . This may be explained by theories of psychological essentialism, which suggest that biogenetic explanations promote the lay belief that underlying \u201cessences\u201d are responsible for a group\u2019s shared characteristics, which in turn triggers the aforementioned stigma attitudes . Indeed, Dittrich et al.  report that essentialism fully mediates the relationship between biogenetic explanations of schizophrenia and increased social distance", "Because of the stigma implications of public perceptions of aetiology, it is also beneficial to consider how the findings map onto previously observed patterns in societal stigma. In the present study, more traditionally stigmatised categories of mental disorders were more likely to be attributed to biological or health/lifestyle factors than less stigmatised categories. Previous research has found that personality and psychotic disorders are highly stigmatised in comparison to other mental disorders types such as eating disorders or anxiety disorders . These observed patterns align with theories of psychological essentialism which imply that biological attributions are associated with greater stigma attitudes, such as perceptions of dangerousness and desire for social distance .\nWhat proportion of articles that mention mental disorders contain causal explanations?", "Thirdly, the findings are necessarily limited to one particular cultural context, in a unique historical moment. This in itself represents an original contribution, as minimal published research has investigated Irish patterns of explaining mental disorders, or pandemic-related effects on attribution internationally. It is unclear whether or how unique features of the Irish Media landscape affect results. For instance, Irish newspapers typically do not have clear affiliations with certain political parties or ideologies. As political affiliations are associated with attributional tendencies, with right-wing attitudes more liked with biological and left-wing with social attributions , a more politicised media landscape may yield different results. Further work is required to establish how the patterns detected in this Irish study compare with other cultural contexts.", ". While mental health literacy research has suggested the public often favour psychosocial attributions for mental illness , there is evidence that biogenetic attributions are becoming more commonplace . Yet the longitudinal rise in biogenetic attributions has not been paralleled by observed improvements in stigmatising attitudes towards people experiencing mental health difficulties, and in the case of certain mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, stigma may be increasing .", "- 38.

Articles invoked determinants that traversed multiple \u2018levels\u2019 of the social world: from individual biographies to interpersonal relations, family dynamics, socio-economic factors and cultural context.

Inductive content analysis was used to identify and classify different types of causal explanations. A preliminary coding frame was developed based on the analysis of 400 randomly-chosen articles covering all of the six mental disorder categories.

The majority of previous studies have used a brief generalised measure of \u201csocial explanations\u201d as a control or comparative point for biological explanations . Minimal research has investigated the potentially variable consequences of endorsing different types of social determinants of mental illness. Social psychologists studying other forms of intergroup relations have proposed the existence of a social component of essentialism, whereby certain social explanations may be associated with similar levels of essentialist thinking as biological explanations . In particular, social attributions perceived as being highly deterministic (e.g", "Overall, 24.63% (n = 466) of the identified articles contained causal explanations for a mental disorder (Fig 1). Due to many of the articles containing multiple attributions, the total number of causal explanations came to a total of 628. Frequencies of articles containing causal explanations varied across type of mental disorder, from 8.70% for substance related disorders, to 29.50% for eating disorders.\nIn terms of the source of attributions, most explanations (51%) originated from an individual\u2019s perception of their own experience with mental illness, whether directly relayed by themselves or someone else. Other sources included relevant experts, such as doctors, psychologists, and scientists (19%), scientific research (17%), and other origins (7%) such as political figures or commentators presented as knowledgeable on the topic.\nCategories of causal attributions", ". Overall, attributions to life events/experiences, the cultural/societal environment, interpersonal relations, and health and lifestyle factors occurred more frequently than attributions to biological or psychological determinants. Life events/experiences were the most common explanation for anxiety and personality disorders, cultural/societal environment for eating disorders, and health/lifestyle factors for mood and psychotic disorders. Interpersonal factors in mental illness aetiology became more salient following the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings emphasise the need for theory and research on lay explanations of mental disorders to account for diversity, both in the range of attributions invoked, and in how attributional patterns shift across time and mental disorders category.", "Anxiety rates, generally, are on the increase in wealthier countries.

Beyond a tendency to collapse potentially diverse social attributions into a single unidimensional category, much previous literature on lay attributions for mental illness is also limited by a tendency to conceptualise \u2018mental illness\u2019 as one universal category . This masks any potential variation in attitudes across specific diagnoses . There is some evidence that members of the public hold differing causal beliefs across mental disorder type. For instance, a review by Angermeyer and Dietrich  found that people are more likely to endorse biological factors as being responsible for schizophrenia than for depression", "Quite why people develop bipolar disorder is not clear cut.

The history of mental illness in Ireland is characterised by stigmatisation and incarceration, gradually ceding to increasing mental health awareness and therapeutic support . However, mental health provision in Ireland remains severely under-resourced, with long waiting-lists and minimal specialist services. An OECD report  found Ireland had the 3rd highest prevalence of mental illness in Europe, with nearly one-in-five residents qualifying for a psychiatric diagnosis. Demand for mental health services, and the salience of mental illness as a public health issue, appear to have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic , making this a timely context to appraise how public understandings of mental disorders are evolving.", "Media representations and their implications\nAn ecologically valid exploration of attributional patterns in public discourse, which can incorporate attention to time and context, necessitates access to naturally-occurring data. The mass media are a key site at which lay publics are exposed to aetiological explanations for mental disorders. While media content does not fully determine lay understandings, it nevertheless plays an important role in shaping public opinion . This is particularly the case regarding more abstract or scientific topics, such as the aetiology of mental disorders, which are not perceptible to immediate observation or experience . Media data offer a naturalistic opportunity to establish the frequency with which causal attributions spontaneously appear, and the range of causes that are invoked, within everyday discourse about mental disorders.", "Moreover, the causal attributions of the general public are key influences on attitudes to and treatment of people with mental illness. In recent decades, public campaigns aimed at reducing stigma or increasing mental health literacy have promoted a medical model of mental illness, often citing genetics or brain chemistry as responsible . However, there is clear evidence to suggest that diverse social factors are also responsible for mental illness, including experiencing or being the subject of violence, discrimination, socioeconomic disadvantage, poor social cohesion, and more . Research has suggested that members of the public underestimate the social determinants of physical illness , but it is unknown whether similar patterns exist for mental illness", ". While the analysis did not aim or claim to cover every single article published on the topic, it is unclear whether these keyword contingencies may have systematically biased the dataset in some way. The analysis itself sought to guard against bias through using an inductive code-development strategy and inter-coder reliability assessment.", "Before: 12th March 2018 -11th March 2020 (n = 339).

The current study provides original insight into the range, relative prevalence, and contextual variability of naturally occurring causal attributions for mental disorders.\nHow are causal explanations for mental disorders represented in Irish news media?", ". The study proposes several avenues for progressing research on causal explanations of mental disorders: most notably more incorporation of naturally occurring data, investigation of the full range of social attributions and their distinct attitudinal effects, clarification of how attributional patterns diverge across different forms of mental disorders, and greater attention to cultural context and change over time.", "Funding: LH is a recipient of a postgraduate scholarship funded by the Irish Research Council under award number GOIPG/2022/1730.

However, previous studies have found personal factors comprise a large proportion of commonly-attributed \u2018psychosocial\u2019 factors ; in the current study, psychological factors accounted for only 8% of the present explanations. This difference may be a methodological artefact. Previous research regarding public aetiological beliefs has typically administered surveys containing a restrictive range of options from which participants may respond . This can obscure attributions that the researchers have not anticipated or spotlight attributions that participants would not spontaneously volunteer\u2013hence the importance of observing naturally occurring discourse", "Articles were categorised based on mental disorder category and whether they were published before or after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 12th March 2020 was chosen to denote the beginning of the pandemic, as on this date the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) issued an official announcement formally acknowledging the COVID-19 crisis as a pandemic and introducing measures to tackle the virus.", ". The relationships between biological attributions and negative social outcomes have been observed in both cross-sectional  and experimental  research, with the latter demonstrating that causal beliefs can be manipulated by exposure to experimentally-presented causal explanations.", "This study uses content analysis to identify the causal explanations for various mental disorders, and their prevalence, in major print and online news media in Ireland. The paper builds on previous literature by revealing the ways in which the public are exposed to causal explanations of mental disorders, paying particular attention to representations of social determinants, which are under-researched in previous literature. It also illuminates differences in news representations across mental disorders type by comparing across six categories of mental disorders. Finally, it investigates the malleability of attributions by exploring whether they shifted following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with a \u2018cultural meanings\u2019 rather than \u2018deficit model\u2019 approach to lay understandings , the concern is not with evaluating the accuracy or \u2018truth\u2019 of public attributions, but documenting their range, prevalence, and distribution across time and mental disorder category.\nMethods", "Public perceptions of the determinants of mental illness have important implications for attitudes and stigma, but minimal previous research has explored how causal attributions are spontaneously invoked in everyday public discourse. This study investigated how causal explanations for mental illness are disseminated in popular Irish news media, in the two years before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keyword searches of a news media database identified 1,892 articles published between March 2018 to March 2022 that mentioned one of six categories of mental disorders: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance-related disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and psychotic disorders. Overall, 25% of the identified articles contained a causal explanation for mental illness. Inductive content analysis revealed the content and prevalence of eight types of causal explanations for mental disorders", "The mistreatment of an individual by those around them was also positioned as responsible for mental health problems (n = 45), including in the forms of bullying, harassment, discrimination, and body shaming, among others.\n\"I was bullied in transition year and fifth year\u201d \u2026 The eating disorder, unfortunately, was a coping mechanism.\n(Irish Independent, 15/03/2021)\nOther features of interpersonal interactions to which mental disorders were attributed included general relationship issues, being compared to other people, and contact with other people with mental illness (n = 7).\nThe problem\u2014one of them, anyway\u2014is that anxiety is infectious. \"The thing about anxiety is, if I\u2019m anxious about something, it\u2019s my primal urge to make you anxious,\"\n(Sunday Independent, 31/03/2019)\nHealth and lifestyle factors.\nOther types of causal explanations for mental disorder in the identified articles included various health and lifestyle factors (13.22%, n = 83).", ". While investigating the differential implications of divergent social attributions was beyond the scope of this study, the analysis provides proof-of-concept of substantial variability within the content of social explanations and emphasises the need for future research to take account of this nuance.", "Content analysis of over 400 news articles identified eight superordinate types of explanation for mental disorders in media discourse: life events/experiences, the cultural/societal environment, interpersonal relations, health/lifestyle factors, biological factors, psychological factors, socio-economic conditions, and the family environment. Overall, the most commonly occurring explanations involved attributions to social phenomena, such as life events/experiences, the cultural/societal environment, and interpersonal relations. Conversely, biological factors accounted for just over one-tenth of observed causal attributions. This arguably indicates the relative volume of interest in biological attributions in previous research may be disproportionate to their real-world frequency within naturally occurring public discourse.", ". Biological factors were most invoked for psychotic or mood disorders, and appeared infrequently in relation to anxiety, eating or personality disorders.", "Relevant codes were attached to each article using NVivo. Codes were not treated as mutually exclusive, and where relevant, explanations presented in the articles were assigned one or more codes. All articles were coded by reviewer one (L.H.), and approximately one-third of the coded articles (n = 178) were additionally independently coded by reviewer two (C.O.C.). Inter-coder agreement  was calculated using the coding comparison function in NVivo. Overall agreement was 92.8% (k = .874; S1 Table). The coding frame was then applied to the remaining articles and slightly modified as appropriate. A frequency analysis was conducted using the Matrix function in NVivo.\nResults\nOverall prevalence of causal explanations", "The relatively low prevalence of biological explanations is notable. It suggests that concerns about the rising societal prominence of biomedical understandings of mental ill-health may be premature, at least within this cultural context. However it is worth noting that in the present findings, health/lifestyle factors presented similar patterns to biological factors in terms of their distributions across mental disorder categories. Features of this attribution category included factors such as substances/medication, lack of sleep, health issues, and diet/malnourishment. As these are primarily physical in nature, it is possible they are conceptualised in a similar manner to biological factors, though further research is needed to investigate this.\nAre causal explanations represented differently across different categories of mental disorders?", "- 9.

A chi square analysis revealed that the distribution of causal explanations differed significantly before and during the pandemic, \u03c72(7, N = 628) = 37.77, p < .001. To pinpoint the specific categories responsible for this difference, eight 2x2 post-hoc analyses using a Bonferroni correction were conducted.

For example, people with deterministic beliefs about one\u2019s social origin show more prejudice against other nationalities . It is unknown whether different social attributions for mental illness have distinct attitudinal consequences. Even more fundamentally, no research has catalogued the range and relative prevalence of social explanations for mental illness, which circulate in the public sphere.", "Secondly, the search terms in the current study present some limitations. While the use of DSM-5 diagnostic terms allowed for meaningful comparison across mental disorder types, and ensured the dataset was not overwhelmed by non-clinical references to terms such as \u2018anxiety\u2019 and \u2018addiction\u2019, results were affected by some diagnostic terms being more widely used than others. For example, the terms \u201canorexia nervosa\u201d and \u201cphobia\u201d were used relatively faithfully, but the number of articles recovered about substance addiction was low due to infrequent lay use of formal diagnostic terms like \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d. Similarly, the mood disorder category was more representative of bipolar disorder than major depressive disorder due to greater commonality of the term \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d than \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d in everyday language. The search terms also did not capture generic discussions of \u201cmental health\u201d or \u201cmental illness\u201d", ". Of course, even naturalistic datasets are subject to the unique contingencies of that form of communication. For example, the infrequent reference to psychological causes in media data may reflect writers\u2019 tendencies to avoid introducing causal explanations that imply a high degree of personal blame towards the affected person, in an attempt to ameliorate sigma narratives. Additionally, the position of life events/experiences as the most frequent attribution overall (20.86%) may be a result of news sources placing greater focus on reporting recent events of significance, such as crimes or serious accidents. Analysis of more informal naturalistic data, such as social media or verbal conversations, may yield different results.", "These trends present both similarities and differences to previously documented patterns in public perceptions of aetiology. In terms of similarities, the findings reflect public tendencies to attribute personality disorders to trauma and stress , and to more frequently endorse biological determinants for schizophrenia than other mental disorders . However, the present findings differ from research which suggests that eating disorders are more likely to be attributed to personal factors , and that depression and schizophrenia are most likely to be attributed to acute stress .

As proposed by attribution theory , this may be due to a natural tendency to search for meaning behind unusual or challenging phenomena . Causal attributions have been shown to aid people with mental health difficulties in navigating their own experiences with mental illness by redirecting blame away from themselves , and finding meaning in their experiences . Conversely, attributions that foster self-blame can impede adjustment and coping processes .", "Finally, results are descriptive and do not facilitate inference about the cause or effects of the attributional patterns demonstrated. However this is appropriate for an initial exploratory study. This descriptive data is vital to inform future ecologically valid, hypothesis-driven research, for example regarding the influence of COVID-19 on attributions or the differential effects of various social attributions.\nConclusions", "Public beliefs about the causes of mental illness have important implications for people with mental health difficulties. For instance, the belief that biological factors are responsible for mental illness has been shown to be associated with greater stigmatising attitudes, such as desire for social distance or perceptions of dangerousness . Exposure to information about mental illness that circulates in public discourse, such as through news media, can sway public opinion , and in the past has contributed to the formation of negative attitudes and harmful stereotypes . Exploring how causal explanations are disseminated in real-world contexts can provide insight into how members of the public encounter such information, and consequently, how their understandings may be shaped", "Overexposure to fear-inducing or distressing information was also a factor deemed responsible for both causing and exacerbating the symptoms of mental illness (n = 11). This information commonly centred around topics such as climate change, COVID-19, animal cruelty, and other health and wellness related information.\nHis breakdown, when it came nearly half a century later, would be triggered by news reports of cruelty to animals in Africa, particularly elephants, that left him feeling angry and powerless.\n(Irish Daily Mail, 12/03/2021)\nAmongst the less common features of the cultural or societal environment attributed to influencing mental disorders were modern ways of living, rapid cultural change, political events, and a lack of coherency between the individual and their societal environment (n = 9).", "Causal explanations also included a person\u2019s sleeping pattern or the amount of sleep they received (n = 13).\nIf you live against your natural rhythms\u2014for example, your body wants you to go to sleep at 9pm, but you force yourself to stay up later\u2014you are at high risk for sleep deprivation, chronic stress, mood disorders, lowered immunity and compromised overall health.\n(Irish Daily Mail, 08/01/2022)\nPhysical illnesses or health issues were also identified as determinants of mental illness (n = 7).\nAn Oxford study published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal last April looked at the records of almost a quarter-of-a-million patients diagnosed with Covid-19: a third had a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the six months following their Covid-19 diagnosis\n(Sunday Independent, 17/20/2021)\nOther health and lifestyle factors included a lack of physical activity, changes to one\u2019s daily routine, and exposure to pollution (n = 8).", "Anonymous.

Environmental and social factors also play a significant role in the development of these conditions. Therefore, while this finding is significant, it should not lead to oversimplifying mental health disorders as solely caused by genetics.\n\nAs more studies are conducted, we may see genetically tailored therapies or preventative measures in the future. This could have a significant impact on individuals struggling with mental health disorders, as well as their families and communities. However, it could also lead to debates on genetic determinism and the potential dangers of reducing complex conditions to a single genetic cause.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the DAT-K619N variant has shed light on the complexity of genetics in mental health and the need for further research to fully understand and address these conditions.", "user_utterance": "Could you please explain the significance of the DAT-K619N variant in the context of mental health research?", "search_queries": ["What is the DATK619N variant?", "How does this genetic mutation affect mental health disorders?", "Are there other single genetic anomalies that have been linked to multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-integrationist/201409/genetic-mutation-can-affect-mental-physical-health", "description": "Key points.

Further, it can increase the risk of having an adverse reaction to receiving nitrous oxide anesthesia (a common dental anesthetic). Therefore, individuals with an MTHFR mutation should speak with their physicians/dentists prior to undergoing any procedure that would require anesthesia.\nA Quick, Basic Genetics Overview", "As you may remember from biology class, genes are pieces of our DNA that control a specific characteristic (such as hair or eye color, etc.). Each gene is made up of two alleles, or specific forms of that gene. In short, genes and their alleles determine what traits we inherit from our ancestors. Sometimes these traits are obvious, such as having blue vs. brown eyes. Other times, the result of a specific trait may not be immediately obvious, such as whether we will like or detest the herb cilantro, metabolize caffeine quickly or slowly, or have increased or decreased risk of a health problem down the road.\nA mutation is a naturally occurring process that causes a specific variation on one or more alleles of a particular gene, changing a sequence in our DNA. Having a mutation on both alleles at a specific location on a gene is generally associated with a greater impact than if only one of a pair of alleles is different from normal.\nHow Common Are MTHFR Mutations?", "Despite the increased risks, however, having a specific MTHFR mutation has been associated with a reduced risk of acute lymphatic leukemia and colon cancer in those who have adequate folate levels.\nThe good news is that the risk of a variety of health problems is increased in those with MTHFR mutations, but thankfully, developing these problems is not guaranteed. If you have a personal or significant family history of one or more of the above illnesses, and in particular, if you have not responded as well as expected to conventional treatment for depression or other mental health issues, it is worth speaking with your medical provider about being tested for an MTHFR mutation. The preliminary research on MTHFR, autism, and ADHD suggest that adequate prenatal intake of folate \u2013 both in the period 3 months before conception and during the first month of pregnancy in particular \u2014 can reduce these risks.\nOther Factors That Interfere With Folate Metabolism and Increase Health Risks", "In addition to having an MTHFR mutation, there are other factors associated with decreased folate levels or poor absorption, including malnutrition, gastrointestinal illness, and high alcohol consumption. If you have an MTHFR mutation and/or one of the above issues, it is important to know that you will have reduced ability to metabolize folic acid, the synthetic form of folate that is found in processed foods (e.g., breads, cereals) and vitamins.\nWhat You Can Do\nThere are some simple and inexpensive steps one can take to reduce the risks associated with MTHFR mutations, possibly improve response to antidepressant therapies, and feel better in general:", "Pu, D., Shen, Y., & Wu, J. (2013). Association between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and the risk of autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis.

Has enhanced folate status during pregnancy altered natural selection and possibly Autism prevalence? A closer look at a possible link. Medical Hypotheses, 71(3), 406-410.", "Normally, the MTHFR gene produces enough of the related enzyme to perform its associated functions well. One function that is particularly important to mental health is the conversion of an essential B-vitamin, folate, into the more usable form, l-methylfolate.\nL-Methylfolate enables our bodies to convert the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body then uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds, including neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). These brain chemicals are essential for a number of aspects of mental health; thus, when this process is impaired, it can increase the likelihood of the mental health issues mentioned previously. In addition, when the enzyme is not working at normal capacity, it can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular and other health problems.", "This post may be of greatest interest to those who have been diagnosed with one of the mental health issues linked to having an MTHFR mutation, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism. MTHFR mutations also increase the risk of several physical health problems, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease and stroke, recurrent early miscarriage, migraine with aura, osteoporosis, and some cancers. So, it\u2019s worth knowing about this mutation even if one or more of the above conditions run in your family.\nResponse to Drugs", "- Strive to eat a diet that is healthy in general and includes folate-rich foods. Leafy greens, broccoli, lentils, and many beans are great sources of folate, fiber, and other nutrients.\n- Because MTHFR impacts the process of methylation, it is also recommended to take a methylated (and more usable) form of B12, known as methylcobalamin, rather than the more commonly available cyanocobalamin form. B12 absorption is essential for good mental health, and is also compromised by the MTHFR mutation and the other factors listed above.\n- Speak with your healthcare provider about what the your nutritional and vitamin regimen should consist of, including what doses would be most appropriate for you.", "By some estimates, up to 40% of the population may have an MTHFR mutation of some kind. The current data suggest that between 6 and 14% of Caucasians and about 2% of those of African descent probably have a more severe (two mutated alleles) version of the mutation. In Hispanics, this number may be as high as 21%.\nBut even having one mutated allele is associated with an increased risk of certain health problems. For example, having one mutated allele at either of two specific locations is associated with 20-40% reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme (depending on where on the gene the mutation is found). Having two mutated alleles at the same location is associated with a 40-70% reduction in enzyme activity, again, with severity depending upon the location of the mutated alleles. Some people may have two mutated alleles \u2013 one at each of two different locations on the gene \u2014 and that also increases risk of a number of health issues.\nHow Does This Gene Impact Health?"], "title": "A Genetic Mutation That Can Affect Mental & Physical Health"}, {"url": "https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/common-genetic-factors-found-5-mental-disorders", "description": "Scientists have long recognized that many psychiatric disorders tend to run in families, suggesting potential genetic roots.

Such disorders include autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.

In fact, recent studies have turned up limited evidence of shared genetic risk factors, such as for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, autism and schizophrenia, and depression and bipolar disorder.", "The analysis revealed variations significantly associated with all 5 disorders. These included variations in 2 genes that code for the cellular machinery that helps regulate the flow of calcium into neurons. Variation in one of these, called CACNA1C, had previously been linked to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and major depression. CACNA1C is known to affect brain circuitry involved in emotion, thinking, attention and memory \u2014 functions that can be disrupted in mental illnesses. Variation in another calcium channel gene, called CACNB2, was also linked to the 5 disorders.\nIn addition, the researchers discovered illness-linked variation for all 5 disorders in certain regions of chromosomes 3 and 10. Each of these sites spans several genes, and causal factors haven\u2019t yet been pinpointed. The suspect region along chromosome 3 had the strongest links to the disorders. This region also harbors certain variations previously linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.", "\u201cAlthough statistically significant, each of these genetic associations individually can account for only a small amount of risk for mental illness,\u201d says study co-author Dr. Jordan Smoller of Massachusetts General Hospital. Because of this, the variations couldn\u2019t yet be used to predict or diagnose specific conditions. But these results may help researchers move closer to making more accurate diagnoses.

The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time.

Our teams use multiple sources of genomic data from CDC, public health laboratories, and commercial diagnostic laboratories, to identify and monitor the spread of variants. Through detection and tracking of new variants, CDC is able to support outbreak preparedness and prevention efforts.\nAgain, KP.3.1.1 descended from KP.3, which descended from the Omicron family. Since the original Omicron variant first emerged in the fall of 2021, Omicron offshoots such as BA.5 and XBB.1.5 have become predominant and then subsequently replaced by other variants in the Omicron family.\nCOVID-19 activity remains elevated", "Early indicators such as test positivity rose to 18.3% for the week ending August 10, from 17.9% the week before.

The wastewater viral activity level for COVID-19 has been rising since mid-May and is currently very high across most parts of the country.\nHospitalizations due to COVID-19, an indication of disease severity, have also been rising, albeit modestly.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nThe good news is that in the early spring of 2024, COVID-19 cases were down, with far fewer infections and hospitalizations than were seen in the previous winter. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "The FLiRT strains are subvariants of Omicron, and together they accounted for the majority of COVID cases in the U.S. at the beginning of July. One of them, KP.3, was responsible for 36.9% of COVID infections in the United States, KP.2 made up 24.4%, and KP.1.1 accounted for 9.2% of cases.\nThe LB.1 strain, which similar to the FLiRT variants but with an additional mutation, has attracted attention as well. As summer began, it was responsible for 14.9% of COVID cases. (The percentages are based on CDC Nowcast estimates, which provide projections that can change as more data is reported.)\nMeanwhile, during the same period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant COVID uptick in several states, based on spikes in emergency room visits and detections of the virus in wastewater. (Wastewater testing can help detect the spread of a COVID in a community.)", "\u201cViruses mutate all the time, so I\u2019m not surprised to see a new coronavirus variant taking over,\u201d says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. If anything, he says the new mutations are confirmation that the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a bit of a wild card, where it\u2019s always difficult to predict what it will do next. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing it will continue to mutate.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest question, Dr. Roberts says, is whether the newly mutated virus will continue to evolve before the winter, when infections and hospitalizations usually rise, and if a new fall COVID vaccine will target them.\nBelow, Dr. Roberts answers three questions about the FLiRT variants.\n1. Where did the FLiRT and LB.1 strains come from?", "Nobody knows exactly where the FLiRT variants first emerged. They were first detected in the U.S. in wastewater by the CDC, which tests sewage to detect traces of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in a community, even if people don\u2019t have symptoms. (The data can be used as an early warning that infection levels may be increasing or decreasing in a community.) The FLiRT strains have since been identified in several other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom.", "To better understand how the FLiRT strains emerged, it might help to see how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed over time, with new variants forming as mutations emerged in its genetic code. Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2. What do we know\u2014and not know\u2014about the FLiRT and LB.1 variants?", "We know the FLiRT variants have two mutations on their spike proteins (the spike-shaped protrusions on the surface of the virus) that weren\u2019t seen on JN.1 (the previously dominant strain in the U.S.). Some experts say these mutations could make it easier for the virus to evade people\u2019s immunity\u2014from the vaccine or a previous bout of COVID.\nWhile more research is needed, experts suspect that the LB.1 strain and another variant called KP.2.3, which also has the two FLiRT mutations plus an additional one, may be more transmissible as well.\nBut, the fact that the variants are otherwise genetically similar to JN.1 should be reassuring, Dr. Roberts says. \"While JN.1 occurred during the winter months, when people gather indoors and the virus is more likely to spread, its symptoms were milder than those caused by variants in the early years of the pandemic,\" he says.", "There is no conclusive information yet about whether a COVID illness will be more severe with the new variants or how symptoms might change. Because everyone is different, a person\u2019s symptoms and the severity of their COVID disease usually depend less on which variant they are infected with and more on their immunity and overall health, the CDC says.\n3. How can people protect themselves against the FLiRT and LB.1 strains?\nVaccination is still a key strategy, says Dr. Roberts, adding that everyone eligible for COVID vaccination should make sure they are up to date with the latest COVID vaccines. While vaccination may not prevent infection, it significantly lowers a person\u2019s risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID.", "\u201cI would especially recommend anyone who qualifies for the vaccine because of advanced age get it if they haven\u2019t already,\u201d Dr. Roberts adds. \u201cThe reason is that the biggest risk factor for a bad outcome from COVID is advanced age.\u201d Anyone over age 65 is eligible for both the first updated vaccine offered in the fall of 2023, and a second shot four months later.\nHe also says COVID tests should be able to detect strains related to JN.1, and antiviral treatments should remain effective against them. Paxlovid, the primary treatment for most people with COVID, acts on a \u201cnonspiked part of the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's relatively variant-proof, so it should really act against many future COVID iterations.\u201d\nOther preventive efforts can help. You can avoid getting too close to people who are sick, mask strategically, wash hands properly, improve ventilation, and stay aware of COVID transmission levels where you live and work.

The DAT-K619N variant has been linked to a range of mental health disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. It is believed that this mutation leads to a decrease in dopamine uptake, which can affect the neural pathways involved in these disorders.\n\nStudies have shown that this variant alters the function of the DAT protein, leading to an increase in dopamine levels in certain areas of the brain.

Most attention in critical care exams tends to focus on NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors, so named after the substances which selectively bind to them (eg.

The increase or decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP could also lead to conflicting membrane effects. For example, D1 receptor secondary messenger signalling produces an inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase activity, which should have a depolarising effect by making the resting membrane potential less negative (Pirovarov et al, 2019). D2 effects, on the other hand, seem to be mainly \"inhibitory\", as they produce a hyperpolarisation of the membrane by the modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels (Maurice et al, 2004). Moreover D2 receptors are available in presynaptic and postsynaptic flavours, each with distinct effects (presynaptic ones, for example, inhibit further dopamine release by a negative feedback mechanism, whereas postsynaptic ones can actually enhance downstream dopamine release).

Specifically, you'd have to classify them as non-selective ligand-gated cation channels. When they bind glutamate, they open, allowing the traffic of sodium, calcium and potassium. Sodium and calcium enter the cell, and potassium exists concurrently; logically this should be expected to have a depolarising effect, except the membrane is usually already depolarised at this point. That is because of an added level of weirdness, often described as a \"coincidence detector\" function: these channels remain closed to ions even when they have bound their ligand, because their pore is constantly blocked by a magnesium ion. This ion is only dislodged from its position when the membrane of the post-synaptic neuron is depolarised. Thus, the receptor is both voltage-gated and ligand-gated, with both factors necessary for it to function", "Sherin, Jonathan E., et al. \"Innervation of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons by GABAergic and galaninergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the rat.\" Journal of Neuroscience 18.12 (1998): 4705-4721.\nHaas, H.

Its effects in inflammation and gastric acid secretion need to be mentioned, but are completely unrelated to its neurotransmitter action. Both histamine receptors (H1 and H2) are metabotropic:\nThe membrane effects of H1 receptors seems to be excitatory in every sense: their activation leads to a depolarisation of the membrane through changes in potassium conductance, and they inhibit hyperpolarisation. H2 receptors also seem to have some sort of excitatory effect, as they seemed to prevent the long afterdepolarisation in cortical and thalamic neurons, reducing their refractory period (Haas et al, 1989).", "Serotonin, another monoamine, is not just a neurotransmitter, and is found in all sorts of places (platelets, etc). Its contribution to inflammation and clotting will not be mentioned here. The neurotransmitter effects of serotonin are mediated by a huge receptor family of seven different types, each of which has further subtypes. There is probably no merit in describing each and every serotonin receptor subtype, as this would lead to depression.

For the intensivist, the most important physiological roles of dopamine neurotransmission are related to its effects on movement, arousal and behaviour. In summary:\nRole of dopamine in movement relates to the regulatory role of dopamine in the nigrostriatal region of the basal ganglia. From here, projections to the rest of the basal ganglia are involved in the control of voluntary movement and coordination. Interference with dopaminergic neurotransmission here can lead to a paucity of movement (Parkinson disease) or its excess (tardive dyskinesia).\nRole of dopamine in alertness and consciousness: Dopaminergic neurotransmission is crucially important to all sorts of complex prefrontal functions such as learning, working memory, aggression, emotion, motor control, and food intake.", "Role in the regulation of mood: Serotonin is famously involved in the mind-bogglingly complex systems which give rise to the overall behavioural trend we describe as our \"mood\", though what exactly is meant by this has escaped better authors. Mitchell & Phillips (2007) is a good safe reference that focuses on the executive effects of mood and the effects of serotonin on them. It appears the 5-HT2A receptor subtype is the most important. From the perspective of the intensivist, the greatest interest for this lies not in the mood-related neurotransmitter effects per se, but rather in the side effects of the drugs which are used to treat mood disturbances, and in their toxicology.", "Thus, you'd want to have plenty of glutamate and GABA around for this shunt to keep working properly. One other interesting feature of this otherwise boring diagram is the central role of the activated form of Vitamin B6 in the synthesis of GABA. From here, one might expect that any interference with B6 function or availability might give rise to some sort of pathologically hyperexcitable state, and that would be correct - isoniazid, the anti-TB drug, binds to B6 and prevents the synthesis of GABA, and refractory seizures are the result.", "Role in the management of migraine: Though there does not seem to be a well-accepted physiological mechanism for this, serotonin is clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of migrain headache, at least insofar as serotonin receptor agonists seem to have an antimigraine effect (Hamel, 2007). Specifically, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonists are of interest to the migraineur.\nSo, in short, if one were ever asked to \"classify the 5HT receptors and give examples of pharmacological agents that affect them\", one could regurgitate this table. In case anybody is wondering where any of this information comes from, it was \"xPharm: the Comprehensive Pharmacology Reference\" (2009), by Ennam & Bylund. In this encyclopaedic work, each receptor subtype has its own short chapter.", "Role in cognition, learning and memory: without going into too much detail (for that we have Peng et al, 2011, and G\u00e9cz, 2010), it will suffice to say that glutamate seems essential for cognition, memory, learning, and probably consciousness in a broader sense. Reidel et al (2003) report extensive evidence to support this, most of which amounts to repeated findings that animals whose NMDA receptors are chronically blocked become really bad at exploring mazes.\nRole as a differential for unexplained encephalopathy: for some unhappy reason, NMDA receptors are occasionally the target of autoantibodies which give rise to limbic encephalitis. Come to think of it, this really isn't a physiological role.", "There is no reason whatsoever to remember the muscarinic receptor subtypes and their various secondary messenger molecules. It is probably more important to keep in mind that nicotinic receptors are channels which are supposed to act as sodium channels, but which in reality permit the bi-directional flow of all cations, leading to embarassing potassium leakage (this is the basis of suxamethonium-induced hyperkalemia, another favourite topic for viva questions). Nicotionic neurotransmission is therefore a clearly \"excitatory\" phenomenon, as the opening of these acetylcholine channels will lead to the depolarisation of the post-synaptic neuron.", ". At this dose, neurotoxicity is observed in the hippocampus (Takasaki, 1978): the neurons become oedematous and begin to degenerate, likely due to the development of excitotoxicity. As far as a lazy Google search can reveal, there are no human case reports of large-scale glutamate toxicity.", "This chapter is relevant to the aims of Section K1(vii) from the 2023 CICM Primary Syllabus, which asks the exam candidate to \"describe the major neurotransmitters and their physiological role, with particular reference to excitatory and inhibitory amino acids (including those acting on the NMDA receptor), GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin\". They ask you this, but never follow through with actually putting it into the exams. The only time this has become even vaguely exam-relevant has been in Question 1(p.2) from the first paper of 2010, and even this question is only related to neurotransmitters because it asked for the physiological basis of serotonin syndrome (unsurprisingly, the pass rate was 0%). Also, Question 17 from the second paper of 2012 had asked for a selection of drugs which act on serotonin receptors.", "Synapses form at numerous sites along a neuron. Here's a picture of pyramidal neuron from Hrvoj-Mihic et al (2013), demonstrate the comparatively massive scale of this cell. As you can see, the cell body of the neuron itself is huge (about ten erythrocytes could fit inside). The branching dendrites projecting from the main body span over hundreds of micrometres, and the axon could potentially be a metre long.\nNote how these projections are studded by little thickened swellings. These are \"dendritic spikes\" and \"axonal boutons\", the sites of synaptic connection between neurons. They can be terminal boutons (i.e. at the very end of an axon), or they can occur along the length of an axon like huge deformed nodes of Ranvier. Here, some excellent art from Nicol & Walmsley (1993) reconstructs such an en passant bouton from a series of electron microscope slices:", "It would be tempting at this point to pull out Adobe Illustrator and create some nasty diagram full of popping vesicles and hotdog-shaped receptor molecules, but one cannot help but feel that this would be insulting to the reader. By the point they decide to resort to Deranged Physiology, people are typically at some halfway point though their critical care training, and therefore well familiar with abstract diagrams of the synapse. For these people, it's time for the real thing, or at least its osmium-stained shadow.\nA \"synapse\" is defined as a junctions between nerve cells, or the site where they communicate. The term is usually credited to Charles Sherrington who had first used it in a 1897 physiology textbook:", "Pharmacological properties of glutamate are certainly never going to grant anybody a flawless pass mark in an exam, but some group of people may be interested in the possibility of getting high by eating or injecting this neurotransmitter. This community would be very disappointed with the effects. The sodium salt of glutamate, otherwise known as umami, will not appear in the bloodstream unless it is ingested in truly absurd doses (Fernstrom, 2018).This is because glutamate is immediately transformed into alanine in the small intestine, and so its bioavailability is rather poor.", "The normal daily intake of an average Westerner eating a relatively normal MSG-flavoured diet is apparently 0.3-1.0g/d, which should not be expected to elevate serum glutamate levels even by one molecule. In fact, even truly humongous doses are eliminated on first pass. Back in the 1950s when it was still possible to experiment on mental patients, Himwich et al (1955) tested the effect of escalating oral doses and found that \"whether the patient is on placebo or 45 grams of glutamic acid per day, there is no observable difference in the glutamic acid remaining in the plasma\". Apparently doses up to 150g/day are well tolerated even after fasting, even though the plasma concentration of glutamate does increase tenfold. In mouse studies, it appears that around 4g/kg of subcutaneous monosodium glutamate (280g for a normal adult) is required to raise the serum concentration of glutamate to a dangerous level", "This is probably the most important \"excitatory\" neurotransmitter, well covered by Zhou & Danbolt (2014) and Fonnum (1984). Textbook authors tend to emphasise its importance by describing it as \"the most prevalent amino acid in the brain\", or quoting some sort of concentration value, which they say is the highest for any neurotransmitter or amino acid. Sure, that is true - Arne Schousboe (1981) is often quoted as saying that the brain contains 5-15 mmol/kg of glutamate, which would be 0.7-2.2g - but it is probably irrelevant to its neurotransmitter function, or to its \"importance\", however you want to measure that. Certainly, glutamate neurotransmission seems essential for life; for example knockout mice who lacked a critical subunit of the NMDA channel complex all died within about 15 hours of birth, apparently from respiratory failure (Forrest et al, 1994).", "Dong, Xiao-xia, Yan Wang, and Zheng-hong Qin. \"Molecular mechanisms of excitotoxicity and their relevance to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.\" Acta Pharmacologica Sinica 30.4 (2009): 379-387.\nMcEntee, William J., and Thomas H.

Rectal temperature increased in association with this abuse. \"It appears that m-CPP activates a mode of metabolic thermogenesis governed by a nocturnally sensitive proportional control mechanism\" the investigators giggled. They published in Nature. Taking advantage of the obvious pun, the bottom line here is that serotonergic neurotransmission is involved in the central regulation of body temperature, and drugs which increase the availability of serotonin at these receptors will produce hyperthermia.", "These boutons represent the synaptic interface. Two boutons or a bouton and a dendritic spike would typically lay in close apposition. To help visualise this, Burette et al (2012) published some detailed images of synaptic ultrastructure, which represents the next level of zoom.

This pain-related \"recruitability\" of NMDA receptors results in a significant amplification of the pain response, and may underlie the analgesic effects of ketamine.", "What happens when a noradrenergic neuron connects to another neuron, instead of a cardiac myocyte? That probably depends on which neuron and which receptors. For example, when Grzelka et al (2017) looked at the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the pyramidal neurons, they found that \u03b21 receptor activation produced an inward sodium current, which had a depolarising influence (it was carried by some of the same cyclic nucleotide-gated channels that you might have expected from the aforementioned cardiac myocyte). But when Madison & Nicoll (1985) looked at noradrenergic neurotransmission in the rat hippocampus, they found that activation of \u03b1-receptors resulted in the hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane, which seemed to be a mechanism designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the neurotransmission through that system.\nThe physiological roles of noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter can be oversimplified as follows:", ". Sure, it can serve a synaptic function, insofar as they could potentially allow the propagation of an action potential, but they are not critically important for synaptic transmission (Blanke et al, 2008) and their main role is in various interesting neuromodulatory second messenger effects.", "For the intensive care trainee at the early stages of their training, the relevance of acetylcholine receptors lies in their following roles:\nRole in neuromuscular junction: acetylcholine receptors here are competitively inhibited by non-depolarising neuromuscular junction blockers, and propped open (and therefore also blocked, but in a different way) by depolarising neuromuscular junction blockers. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors act here to increase the presence of acetylcholine, which will reverse the effects of competitive NMJ blockade.", "As you can see, the space is very small - the average distance between the membranes is about 20-30nm. It is also not empty, as you can see from the high electron density of the cleft content. It is filled with a fibrous extracellular protein matrix which acts to keep the two membranes segregated, while acting as a scaffold for various important membrane components (Nakayama et al 2016). The spaces between these protein fibrils are probably filled with a rather pure and wholesome variant of extracellular fluid. Ordinarily, the interstitium between cells is full of gross debris and random cellular metabolic byproducts, but obviously that would not be suitable to a space designed for rapid molecular traffic. However, the contents of the synapse and the contents of the extracellular fluid compartment do tend to mingle, which is how the drugs acting here (eg. metaraminol) find their way to their site of action.", "Role in delirium and toxicology: Anticholinergic effects are common among CNS-acting agents, particularly old-school antipsychotic drugs. As already mentioned, cholinergic neurotransmission is involved in the regulation of alertness, and therefore anticholinergic influences will interfere with this and produce delirium.", "of Neurotransmitters (2020), which is over 700 pages and is actually the main source for most of the material in this chapter. On the other end of the detail/value spectrum, Ayano (2016) is free to read, but is a highly oversimplified summary, and may not be suitable to the CICM trainee. Lastly, specifically for the topic of synaptic transmission, Holz & Fisher (2012) is excellent.\nIf you were a molecule, what characteristics or behaviours would let you call yourself a neurotransmitter? The term sure seems to be thrown around a lot. Most textbooks dealing with neuroscience tend to take upon themselves the task of defining this term. For example, the 2nd ed of Neuroscience by Purves et al (2001) focuses on the location where the substance is secreted:\n\"Neurotransmitters are chemical signals released from presynaptic nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft.\"", "For muscarinic receptor subtypes, the effect is more subtle, and more difficult to classify in this simplistic way. The excellent paper by Michael Caulfield (1993) is a solid resource for those who want to read more about it. In the briefest possible summary, the effect of their second messenger systems will clearly do something to the excitability of that postsynaptic neuron, which could be a decrease or an increase in the excitability, or even a depolarisation, but this occurs by numerous mechanisms which are not easy to nail down and which may be different for each neuron species affected. For example, Lin et al (2004) looked at some M1 receptors in rat nigrostriatal neurons and found that the activation of these receptors had an excitatory effect, depolarising the cells probably by affecting potassium conductance", "Camilleri, Michael. \"Serotonin in the gastrointestinal tract.\" Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity 16.1 (2009): 53.", "Role of GABAB receptors for spasticity and epilepsy is well established. GABAB receptor agonists like baclofen have a muscle relaxant effect. Tiagabine and vigabatrin are GABAB receptor agonists which act as antiepileptic drugs.\nRelevance to horrible diseases is again not a physiological role, but one is still tempted to note that GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) receptor antibodies are responsible for stiff person syndrome, which is the consequence of GABA deficiency, and which is managed by supplementing GABA receptor agonists (Levy et al, 1999).", "Role in excitotoxicity: Because they permit an influx of calcium into the cell, the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors can result in an overabundance of this intracellular messenger, producing mitochondrial membrane depolarisation, caspase cascade activation, the production of free radicals, and all sorts of other intracellular mischief. In short, a sudden unexpected calcium excess can really send a very strong proapoptotic signal to the neurons (Dong et al, 2009). This probably underlies the brain injury seen with uncontrollable status epilepticus", "Noradrenaline is a catecholamine neurotransmitter known to ICU trainees mainly because of its peripheral cardiovascular effects. A whole messy chapter is dedicated to the properties of noradrenaline as a vasopressor. As a neurotransmitter, noradrenaline has peripheral autonomic (sympathetic) and central neuromodulator functions. Specifically, it is released from postganglionic sympathetic neurons (whereas all the rest of the autonomic nervous system runs on acetylcholine), and from noradrenergic nerve terminals in the CNS, which are involved in numerous activities. Additionally, noradrenaline is released into the circulation from the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, but really you could hardly call that neurotransmission, as it is meant to reach various cardiovascular destinations and not nerve terminals.\nNoradrenaline receptors are all metabotropic:", "At the same time, it would be disingenuous to state that one can simply coast through these exams without having the slightest idea about neurotransmitter systems. Some basic understanding is probably beneficial, considering especially that all the examinable CNS-active drugs exert their actions by interfering with neurotransmitter function. This will be the focus of this chapter.\n- Synaptic neurotransmission is the phenomenon where the action potential of one neuron, though an intermediate signal molecule, facilitates a change in the state of another neuron, to which it is connected by a synapse.\n- A synapse is a narrow (20-30 nm) junction between two neurons.\n- Neurotransmitters are molecules used for synaptic signalling, which have the following shared properties:\n- Released from a presynaptic terminal in response to depolarisation\n- Received by specific receptors on the the postsynaptic neuron", "Role in wakefulness and sleep: the histaminergic neurons of the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus seem to be heavily involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. When they are active and firing at their normal rate, they release histamine, which binds to H1 receptors and increases wakefulness (Sherin et al, 1998). H1 receptor antagonists therefore logically promote sleep.\nRegulation of hypothalamic functions: Pretty much everything the pituitary gland does is mediated by histaminergic neurotransmission from the hypothalamus (Knigge & Warburg, 1991). The release of vasopressin, ACTH, LH and prolactin all seem to be controlled by histaminergic neurons.", "To bring a bit of scientific formality back into this discussion, the following criteria seem to be essential for the definition of a neurotransmitter:\nThese are a bit of a remix of Purves et al (2001) and Inoue (2009); the two sources are equally authoritative reference texts for neurophysiology, but their criteria for calling something a neurotransmitter are more than slightly different.

The most important point for this chapter would be to note that none of these receptors have a direct effect on the resting membrane potential of other neurons, and therefore cannot be classified as \"excitatory\" or \"inhibitory\". In spite of this, noradrenaline is usually classified as an excitatory neurotransmitter, probably because it is also involved in the regulation of alertness and attention.", "Role in sympathetic nervous system: though comparatively minor in comparison to acetylcholine, noradrenaline has pharmacological importance for the neural autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure, as well as thermoregulation, bladder relaxation, and several other maintenance functions.

This disappointing performance by both the trainees and the examiners highlights one important point which should be comforting to the trainee preparing for the CICM primaries: neither the candidate nor the faculty knew how to explain serotonin syndrome physiologically, and both groups are now successful intensivists, i.e. this does not seem to have been much of an impediment to any of their careers.", "Acetylcholine is dealt with in more detail in a series of dedicated chapters from the series on the autonomic nervous system, starting with the one on synthesis and metabolism of acetylcholine. Without revisiting a lot of that information, it is acetylated choline.

A GABA neuron might inhibit another GABA neuron, which is the inhibition of inhibition, i.e. excitation. Moreover, some neurotransmitters (eg. acetycholine) may have either an inhibitory or an excitatory effect, depending on the receptor subtype. A subtle variant of this is to separate neurotransmitters into those with \"direct\" effects and those which are merely \"neuromodulatory\", but again many of them could fall into both categories.", "- Subsequently reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron or glia, or metabolized into an inactive form by enzymes to terminate the stimulation.\n- A single neurotransmitter tends to be dominant in any given neuron (Dale's Principle), though this is not always true.\n- Neurotransmitters include:\n- Excitatory neurotransmitters:\n- Glutamate\n- Dopamine\n- Noradrenaline\n- Acetylcholine (nicotinic receptors)\n- Inhibitory neurotransmitters:\n- GABA\n- Serotonin\n- Acetylcholine (muscarinic receptors)\nYou could really do no better than Roy Webster's Neurotransmitters, drugs and brain function (2001).

However, it goes without saying that these statements are mostly speculative, as we do not know what consciousness even is, let alone how the interplay of neurotransmitter systems influences it, or which neurotransmitter system plays thedominant regulatory role.

There's a lot more detail about all this in Kroeze et al (2002), in case the reader needs to know exactly which secondary messengers are used where, but it is not essential for any real-life purpose, unless one plans to become a dedicated serotonin specialist. For the ICU trainee, the main physiological roles to know about consist of the following list:", "Role in consciousness and alertness: Acetylcholine in the CNS does not seem to act in the same way as it acts in the periphery. Instead of mediating instant nerve-to-nerve transmission, instead central cholinergic neurons seem to act as neuromodulators, changing the excitability of other neurotransmitter pathways (Picciotto et al, 2012). Without going into too much detail (not that it's understood particularly well even by experts), one can broadly say that cholinergic neuromodulation has a major role to play in things like attention, affect, hunger, memory deposition and the overall level of alertness.

Unfortunately, these categories really tell you nothing about how these neurotransmitters behave or their influence on nervous system function.\nIn any case the whole point of this is to demonstrate that there is no sensible way to classify neurotransmitters into functionally relevant non-overlapping categories, because the functions of neurotransmitters are so considerably overlapping, and to classify them chemically would be pointless because it would have no functional relevance. This is a defence of the totally arbitrary and unscientific classification system used below, which is based on nothing more than the importance of a neurotransmitter to the intensivist, grouping them into \"interesting\" and \"not\".", "Role of dopamine in goal-oriented behaviour: Dopaminergic neurotransmission, particularly projections from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, is implicated in the stimulus-response arcs associated with addiction. Dopaminergic drugs of abuse influence this system in complex ways which are incompletely understood, but which seem to affect limbic pathways involved in complex behaviours associated with reward and punishment.\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is not exactly a physiological role, but needs to be mentioned here at least in passing as an interesting toxidrome. In short, this is a syndrome of decreased consciousness with classical motor manifestations, characterised by muscle rigidity and fever.", "Now, for the longest time, it was believed that these vesicles all contained the same neurotransmitter, and that in fact throughout the entire neuron the vesicles will all be the same. This was called Dale's Principle, after Sir Henry Dale generalised some of his findings in the autonomic nervous system (Eccles et al, 1954). We now know that this is probably not true, and there are plenty of examples of neurons capable of releasing multiple different neurotransmitter substances into their synapses. However, the terminology of the 1930s has stuck, which means one will still see people referring to \"adrenergic\" or \"dopaminergic\" neurons in the nervous system, as if those cells are restricted in their biochemical range.", "Browning, Kirsteen N. \"Role of central vagal 5-HT3 receptors in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology.\" Frontiers in neuroscience 9 (2015): 413.\nSchwartz, Paul J., et al. \"Serotonin and thermoregulation.\" Neuropsychopharmacology 13.2 (1995): 105-115.\nHamel, E., and Headache Currents. \"Serotonin and migraine: biology and clinical implications.\" Cephalalgia 27.11 (2007): 1293-1300.\nFrancescangeli, James, et al. \"The serotonin syndrome: from molecular mechanisms to clinical practice.\" International journal of molecular sciences 20.9 (2019): 2288.\nSimon, Leslie V., and Michael Keenaghan. \"Serotonin syndrome.\" StatPearls [Internet] (2021).\nDeka, Satyendra, et al. \"Pharmacology of Serotonin and Its Receptors.\" Frontiers in Pharmacology of Neurotransmitters.

They are well covered in a review by Enna Salvatore (2007). GABAA receptors are rapidly acting ligand-gated chloride channels, best known for all the sedative drugs which they acts as the target for. GABAB are slow metabotropic receptors, coupled to G proteins, and their action leads to an overall increase in membrane potassium conductance. Both receptors lead to a hyperpolarisation of the membrane: both potassium and chloride have a similar (very negative) Nernst potential, usually more negative than the resting membrane potential. Letting those ions equilibrate across the membrane would drag the overall resting membrane potential in the direction of a more negative resting voltage.", "The reason glutamate is present in such massive amounts is probably more to do with its importance to cerebral energy metabolism than to its neurotransmitter role. Together with GABA, glutamate is involved in the GABA shunt, a reaction that allows the neuron to bypass the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase step of Krebs cycle. Depending on who you read, this bypass accounts for 10-40% of the total neuronal TCA cycle activity. The main purpose of this shunt is to create GABA from \u03b1-ketoglutarate before it has a chance to get burned as a metabolic fuel, and glutamate is an intermediate step in that process. Observe:", "On this basis, GABA is often referred to as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When GABA affects a neuron, the synaptic site becomes hyperpolarised, and therefore more ion current is required to bring its membrane potential back to the firing threshold. This has a net inhibitory effect if that neuron is responsible for some sort of excitatory action. If the neuron is inhibitory, the inhibition of inhibition is disinhibition, i.e. it permits excitation.\nRole of GABAA receptors for sedation is central. A GABAA receptor could say, without false modesty, that they are sedation. The majority of drugs that intentionally or unintentionally produce a decreased level of consciousness act by modifying the actions of these receptors. Notable examples for which the mechanism of action is known to include benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and suspected to include propofol, volatile halogenated ethers, and a whole host of party drugs.", "This process of calcium-mediated release-recapture-repeat is common to basically all synaptic neurotransmitter molecules. Their unique effects, on the other hand, are mediated by the functional characteristics of their postsynaptic receptor complexes. This is what makes neurotransmitters \"excitatory\" or \"inhibitory\", for example. Which is a handy segue into a discussion of...\nAnother method might be to divide them into \"excitatory\" or \"inhibitory\". The terms refer not to the net effect of the neurotransmitter on the performance of the CNS systems they are involved with, but on the effect on the post-synaptic neuron.

Their job is to carry chemical signals (\u201cmessages\u201d) from one neuron (nerve cell) to the next target cell. The next target cell can be another nerve cell, a muscle cell or a gland.\nYour body has a vast network of nerves (your nervous system) that send and receive electrical signals from nerve cells and their target cells all over your body. Your nervous system controls everything from your mind to your muscles, as well as organ functions. In other words, nerves are involved in everything you do, think and feel. Your nerve cells send and receive information from all body sources. This constant feedback is essential to your body\u2019s optimal function.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy", "- Excitatory. Excitatory neurotransmitters \u201cexcite\u201d the neuron and cause it to \u201cfire off the message,\u201d meaning, the message continues to be passed along to the next cell. Examples of excitatory neurotransmitters include glutamate, epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n- Inhibitory. Inhibitory neurotransmitters block or prevent the chemical message from being passed along any farther. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine and serotonin are examples of inhibitory neurotransmitters.\n- Modulatory. Modulatory neurotransmitters influence the effects of other chemical messengers. They \u201ctweak\u201d or adjust how cells communicate at the synapse. They also affect a larger number of neurons at the same time.\nWhat happens to neurotransmitters after they deliver their message?\nAfter neurotransmitters deliver their message, the molecules must be cleared from the synaptic cleft (the space between the nerve cell and the next target cell). They do this in one of three ways.\nNeurotransmitters:", "These neurotransmitters play a lot of different roles in your nervous system and especially in your brain. Monoamines neurotransmitters regulate consciousness, cognition, attention and emotion. Many disorders of your nervous system involve abnormalities of monoamine neurotransmitters, and many drugs that people commonly take affect these neurotransmitters.\n- Serotonin. Serotonin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Serotonin helps regulate mood, sleep patterns, sexuality, anxiety, appetite and pain. Diseases associated with serotonin imbalance include seasonal affective disorder, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Medications that regulate serotonin and treat these disorders include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).", "In this space, called the synaptic junction, the neurotransmitters carry the message across less than 40 nanometers (nm) wide (by comparison, the width of a human hair is about 75,000 nm). Each type of neurotransmitter lands on and binds to a specific receptor on the target cell (like a key that can only fit and work in its partner lock). After binding, the neurotransmitter then triggers a change or action in the target cell, like an electrical signal in another nerve cell, a muscle contraction or the release of hormones from a cell in a gland.\nWhat action or change do neurotransmitters transmit to the target cell?\nNeurotransmitters transmit one of three possible actions in their messages, depending on the specific neurotransmitter.", "Neurotransmitters are located in a part of the neuron called the axon terminal. They\u2019re stored within thin-walled sacs called synaptic vesicles. Each vesicle can contain thousands of neurotransmitter molecules.\nAs a message or signal travels along a nerve cell, the electrical charge of the signal causes the vesicles of neurotransmitters to fuse with the nerve cell membrane at the very edge of the cell. The neurotransmitters, which now carry the message, are then released from the axon terminal into a fluid-filled space that\u2019s between one nerve cell and the next target cell (another nerve cell, muscle cell or gland).", "- Histamine. Histamine regulates body functions including wakefulness, feeding behavior and motivation. Histamine plays a role in asthma, bronchospasm, mucosal edema and multiple sclerosis.\n- Dopamine. Dopamine plays a role in your body\u2019s reward system, which includes feeling pleasure, achieving heightened arousal and learning. Dopamine also helps with focus, concentration, memory, sleep, mood and motivation. Diseases associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system include Parkinson\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Many highly addictive drugs (cocaine, methamphetamines, amphetamines) act directly on the dopamine system.", "Medications can block the neurotransmitter from being received at its receptor site.\n- Example: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a type of drug class that blocks serotonin from being received and absorbed by a nerve cell. These drugs may be helpful in treating depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\nMedications can block the release of a neurotransmitter from a nerve cell.\n- Example: Lithium works as a treatment for mania partially by blocking norepinephrine release and is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic", "This excitatory neurotransmitter does a number of functions in your central nervous system (CNS [brain and spinal cord]) and in your peripheral nervous system (nerves that branch from the CNS). Acetylcholine is released by most neurons in your autonomic nervous system regulating heart rate, blood pressure and gut motility. Acetylcholine plays a role in muscle contractions, memory, motivation, sexual desire, sleep and learning. Imbalances in acetylcholine levels are linked with health issues, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, seizures and muscle spasms.\nWhy would a neurotransmitter not work as it should?\nSeveral things can go haywire and lead to neurotransmitters not working as they should. In general, some of these problems include:\n- Too much or not enough of one or more neurotransmitters are produced or released.", "- Glutamate. This is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter of your nervous system. It\u2019s the most abundant neurotransmitter in your brain. It plays a key role in cognitive functions like thinking, learning and memory. Imbalances in glutamate levels are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and seizures.\n- Gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA). GABA is the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter of your nervous system, particularly in your brain. It regulates brain activity to prevent problems in the areas of anxiety, irritability, concentration, sleep, seizures and depression.\n- Glycine. Glycine is the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter in your spinal cord. Glycine is involved in controlling hearing processing, pain transmission and metabolism.\nMonoamines neurotransmitters", "- Too much norepinephrine and dopamine activity and abnormal glutamate transmission contribute to mania.\nHow do medications affect the action of neurotransmitters?\nScientists recognized the value and the role of neurotransmitters in your nervous system and the importance of developing medications that could influence these chemical messengers to treat many health conditions. Many medications, especially those that treat diseases of your brain, work in many ways to affect neurotransmitters.\nMedications can block the enzyme that breaks down a neurotransmitter so that more of it reaches nerve receptors.\n- Example: Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine block the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These medications are used to stabilize and improve memory and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders.", "Neurotransmitters play a role in nearly every function in your body. More specifically, neurotransmitters are the chemical communicators that carry a nerve\u2019s message from one nerve cell to the next cell. Without neurotransmitters, your body can\u2019t function. Too high of a level or too low of a level of specific neurotransmitters results in specific health problems. Medications work by increasing or decreasing the amount of or the action of neurotransmitters.", "- Norepinephrine. Norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline) increases blood pressure and heart rate. It\u2019s most widely known for its effects on alertness, arousal, decision-making, attention and focus. Many medications (stimulants and depression medications) aim to increase norepinephrine levels to improve focus or concentration to treat ADHD or to modulate norepinephrine to improve depression symptoms.\nPeptide neurotransmitters\nPeptides are polymers or chains of amino acids.\n- Endorphins. Endorphins are your body\u2019s natural pain reliever. They play a role in our perception of pain. Release of endorphins reduces pain, as well as causes \u201cfeel good\u201d feelings. Low levels of endorphins may play a role in fibromyalgia and some types of headaches.\nAcetylcholine", "- Epinephrine. Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (see below) are responsible for your body\u2019s so-called \u201cfight-or-flight response\u201d to fear and stress. These neurotransmitters stimulate your body\u2019s response by increasing your heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, blood sugar and blood flow to your muscles, as well as heighten attention and focus to allow you to act or react to different stressors. Too much epinephrine can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and other health problems. As a drug, epinephrine is used to treat anaphylaxis, asthma attacks, cardiac arrest and severe infections.", "What body functions do nerves and neurotransmitters help control?\nYour nervous system controls such functions as your:\n- Heartbeat and blood pressure.\n- Breathing.\n- Muscle movements.\n- Thoughts, memory, learning and feelings.\n- Sleep, healing and aging.\n- Stress response.\n- Hormone regulation.\n- Digestion, sense of hunger and thirst.\n- Senses (response to what you see, hear, feel, touch and taste).\nHow do neurotransmitters work?\nYou have billions of nerve cells in your body. Nerve cells are generally made up of three parts:\n- A cell body. The cell body is vital to producing neurotransmitters and maintaining the function of the nerve cell.\n- An axon. The axon carries the electrical signals along the nerve cell to the axon terminal.\n- An axon terminal. This is where the electrical message is changed to a chemical signal using neurotransmitters to communicate with the next group of nerve cells, muscle cells or organs.", "- Fade away (a process called diffusion).\n- Are reabsorbed and reused by the nerve cell that released it (a process called reuptake).\n- Are broken down by enzymes within the synapse so it can\u2019t be recognized or bind to the receptor cell (a process called degradation).\nHow many different types of neurotransmitters are there?\nScientists know of at least 100 neurotransmitters and suspect there are many others that have yet to be discovered. They can be grouped into types based on their chemical nature. Some of the better-known categories and neurotransmitter examples and their functions include the following:\nAmino acids neurotransmitters\nThese neurotransmitters are involved in most functions of your nervous system.", "- The receptor on the receiver cell (the nerve, muscle or gland) isn\u2019t working properly. The otherwise normal functioning neurotransmitter can\u2019t effectively signal the next cell.\n- The cell receptors aren\u2019t taking up enough neurotransmitter due to inflammation and damage of the synaptic cleft (see myasthenia gravis).\n- Neurotransmitters are reabsorbed too quickly.\n- Enzymes limit the number of neurotransmitters from reaching their target cell.\nProblems with other parts of nerves, existing diseases or medications you may be taking can affect neurotransmitters. Also, when neurotransmitters don\u2019t function as they should, disease can happen. For example:\n- Not enough acetylcholine can lead to the loss of memory that\u2019s seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n- Too much serotonin is possibly associated with autism spectrum disorders.\n- An increase in activity of glutamate or reduced activity of GABA can result in sudden, high-frequency firing of local neurons in your brain, which can cause seizures."], "title": "Neurotransmitters: What They Are, Functions & Types"}, {"url": "https://www.aamc.org/news/covid-surging-again-here-s-latest-new-variants-updated-vaccines-and-masking", "description": "On Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time. Some variants emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.", "New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge. CDC closely tracks the numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States and globally. Our teams use multiple sources of genomic data from CDC, public health laboratories, and commercial diagnostic laboratories, to identify and monitor the spread of variants. Through detection and tracking of new variants, CDC is able to support outbreak preparedness and prevention efforts.\nAgain, KP.3.1.1 descended from KP.3, which descended from the Omicron family. Since the original Omicron variant first emerged in the fall of 2021, Omicron offshoots such as BA.5 and XBB.1.5 have become predominant and then subsequently replaced by other variants in the Omicron family.\nCOVID-19 activity remains elevated", "Early indicators such as test positivity rose to 18.3% for the week ending August 10, from 17.9% the week before. Emergency department visits diagnosed as COVID-19 have been rising since mid-May, initially in the West and now with the South and Southeast showing the highest levels. The wastewater viral activity level for COVID-19 has been rising since mid-May and is currently very high across most parts of the country.\nHospitalizations due to COVID-19, an indication of disease severity, have also been rising, albeit modestly. For the week ending July 27, the hospitalization rate was 4.0 per 100,000 people, compared to 3.3 per 100,000 people the week prior.\nBeing up to date with the COVID-19 vaccine can protect you", "CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for all people ages 6 months and older to protect against serious illness from COVID-19. People who are up-to-date on vaccination have lower risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 than people who are unvaccinated or who have not received the recommended doses.\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccines that can provide protection during the 2024\u20132025 respiratory virus season will be available in the fall.
