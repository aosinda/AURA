To further protect the cellars from the summer heat, they would plant chestnut trees, which have spreading, dense canopies but shallow roots which would not intrude on the caverns. The practice of serving beer at these sites evolved into the modern beer garden.", "The rise of lager was entwined with the development of refrigeration, as it made it possible to brew lager year-round (brewing in the summer had previously been banned in many locations across Germany), and efficient refrigeration also made it possible to brew lager in more places and keep it cold until serving. The first large-scale refrigerated lagering tanks were developed for Gabriel Sedelmayr's Spaten Brewery in Munich by Carl von Linde in 1870.\nProduction process\n[edit]Lager uses a process of cool fermentation, followed by maturation in cold storage. The German word \"Lager\" means storeroom or warehouse. The yeast generally used with lager brewing is Saccharomyces pastorianus. It is a close relative of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast used for warm fermented ales.[citation needed]", "Lager\nLager (/\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0\u0261\u0259r/) is a type of beer brewed and conditioned at low temperature.

Yeast plays a key role in creating the distinctive aroma and flavor components that make up an impressive variety of beer styles. Without the metabolism of yeast cells, the traditional production of alcoholic beverages would not be possible.\nYeasts are single-celled organisms with a nucleus that belong to the fungus kingdom. Unlike plant cells, yeast requires no sunlight, and the organism has been the catalyst used in baking and the creation of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. During fermentation, the primary beer yeast species, known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces energy for its cellular metabolism by converting certain sugars into carbon dioxide, alcohols and fermentation by-products.", "Ale yeast strains ferment best at temperatures in the range of 60 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. They are quite diverse in metabolism and in the production of fruity, spicy aroma and flavor compounds imparted to the finished beer. Think of a traditional English brewery using ale yeast in open fermentation vats at a rather cool ambient temperature. The beer ferments in just a few days, and the resulting English bitter style offers elegant notes of dried fruit, stone fruit and perhaps just a hint of butterscotch - all of which are fermentation by-products from the ale yeast.\nAle strains have a knack for excreting ester chemicals that can be perceived as various fruit notes. Being greatly influenced by temperature, ale yeast can experience a four-fold increase in ester production as a result of increasing fermentation temperature from 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Ales fermented at extremely warm temperatures will often exhibit intense fruitiness.", "Lager yeast was first used in Bavaria and then taken to Pilsen in the Czech Republic and Copenhagen in Denmark in the nineteenth century. Brewers often carried out fermentation and cold conditioning (lagering) in icy cellars or caves in the early days. Later, the Industrial Revolution's steam power, refrigeration, pasteurization and railways made it possible for brewers to employ lager yeast and market the resulting beers far and wide.\nMany lager beers are produced with a yeast variant called Saccharomyces carlsbergensis - a cross between classic Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a mysterious wild yeast strain. Recent genetic research shows that this fascinating wild strain probably came from Argentinian tree bark in chilly Patagonia that somehow made its way to Europe on early trading ships.", "Different yeast strains play an essential role in the creation of classic beer styles. Think of the clean, malt-forward character of lagers such as American Standard Lager, Czech Pale Lager and Bavarian lagers such as Helles, Dunkel, Bock, Festbier and M\u00e4rzen. In contrast, American and British ales offer light fruity notes from esters, and most craft beer fans love the complex, fruity, spicy notes of Belgian ales such as Dubbel, Tripel and Witbier.

A warmer environment typically accelerates yeast activity, leading to faster sugar conversion but potentially altering the balance of flavor compounds produced. Conversely, cooler temperatures can slow the process, allowing for the development of more nuanced and complex flavors. This delicate balance requires careful monitoring to achieve the desired sensory outcomes in products like beer, wine, and spirits.\nNutrient availability also influences fermentation characteristics, as yeast relies on a variety of nutrients to thrive and perform optimally. The presence of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids can significantly affect yeast health and metabolism, impacting the efficiency of fermentation and the quality of the final product. Producers often adjust nutrient levels to ensure robust yeast performance and to steer the fermentation toward specific flavor profiles.", "Crafting these hybrids involves leveraging the natural propensity of yeast to undergo genetic mixing. Specialized techniques, such as protoplast fusion, can facilitate this process by allowing the cytoplasmic contents of two different strains to merge. The resulting hybrids can be screened for desirable traits, such as increased alcohol tolerance or the ability to produce specific flavor compounds. This method of strain development offers a level of precision and predictability that is highly valued in commercial fermentation applications.", "Fermentation conditions, such as oxygen levels and fermentation vessels, also contribute to the complexity of flavor profiles. Open fermentation allows for greater interaction with the environment, introducing subtle variations in taste and aroma that are not achievable in closed systems. The material of the fermentation vessel itself can impart unique characteristics, with wooden barrels, for example, infusing notes of vanilla or spice.", "The world of fermentation is a sensory playground where flavor profile variations are as diverse as the yeasts that create them. Each fermentation process offers a unique combination of taste and aroma, shaped by the interplay of yeast strains, substrates, and environmental factors. These variations are particularly evident in the brewing and winemaking industries, where the choice of yeast strain can dramatically alter the final product\u2019s character.\nThe substrate, or the raw material used in fermentation, plays a significant role in determining flavor outcomes. Different grains, fruits, or other fermentable sources impart distinct base notes that interact with yeast-derived compounds. For instance, the use of malted barley in beer production provides a rich canvas of caramel and biscuity flavors, which can be accentuated or subdued by the yeast\u2019s metabolic activities.", "The intricate dance of yeast during fermentation is a testament to its remarkable adaptability. At the heart of this process lies the yeast\u2019s ability to interact with its environment, converting sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide while also producing a myriad of secondary metabolites.

Specifically, hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria increased their maximum CO2 loss by 10.6% when evolving in M medium (p-value = 0.003698, one-way ANOVA) and by 13% in T medium (p-value = 1.328e-08, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2D). This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Next, we assessed the fermentative capacity of the evolved lines under conditions resembling beer wort fermentation (12\u00b0Brix and 12\u00b0C) (Figs 2C and S6 and Tabs A and B in S6 Table).

However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively).
