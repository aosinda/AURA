Historically, lager brewers have relied on commercial yeast strains with limited genetic diversity, resulting in a narrow range of flavors.

Scientists believe that it made its way from Patagonia to Europe on ships during the 15th century, ultimately giving rise to the cold-tolerant S. pastorianus used in lager brewing today.\nWhat makes Patagonian yeast strains stand out is their ability to influence fermentation qualities and produce novel beer flavors. This is due to their natural genetic diversity, which offers brewers a wider range of options to create unique and exciting beer profiles.

The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles .

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers.

We did not observe a significant increase in CO2 production levels in the evolved lines of the H6-A and H8-A hybrids in either M or T media (Figs 2C and S6 and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively). Thus, both evolved hybrid lines generated at cold-temperature, carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria, showed a greater increase in CO2 production than hybrids carrying the S", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", "Genomic DNA was obtained for whole-genome sequencing using the YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research, USA) and sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq500 following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids.

Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", "We thank Antonio Molina, Jos\u00e9 Ruiz, Kamila Urbina, Mirjam Amcoff, Elin G\u00fclich and S.

Initially, three S. cerevisiae strains from vineyards were selected because they showed: i) the highest maximum CO2 loss in beer wort (S2A Fig and S2 Table), ii) the best growth performance under maltotriose conditions (S2B Fig), and iii) the most efficient maltotriose uptake during microculture conditions (S2C Fig). These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", "Statistical analysis\nData visualization and statistical analyses were performed with R software version 4.03. Maximum specific growth rates and total CO2 loss were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences between the mean values of three replicates were tested using Student\u2019s t-test and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A p-value less than 0.05 (p<0.05) was considered statistically significant. Heatmaps were generated using the ComplexHeatmap package version 2.6.2. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on phenotypic data using the FactoMineR package version 2.4 and the factoextra package version 1.07 for extracting, visualizing and interpreting the results.\nResults\nDe novo S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus F1 hybrids show similar phenotypes as their parental strains", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". eubayanus mitochondria confer a greater evolutionary potential than S. cerevisiae mitochondria. The current study encourages the use of wild yeast strains to develop new brewing applications to expand the repertoire of de novo lager yeasts.", "We used sppIDer  to assess the proportional genomic contribution of each species to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in each sequenced hybrid. In addition, we used the tool to identify potential aneuploidies within these genomes. CNVs were called using CNVkit (\u2014method wgs,\u2014-target-avg-size 1000) . As the analysis was performed on a haploid reference (both parental genomes were present), a CNV of log2 = 1 corresponds to a duplication.", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", ". Correct gene deletion was confirmed by standard colony PCR. All primers, gRNAs, and donor DNA are listed in Tab B in S1 Table.", "To assess the impact of hybridization on yeast fitness, we calculated best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients across the 31 hybrids (Fig 1C and Tabs C and D in S3 Table). While some hybrids exhibited positive mid-parent heterosis in 5 out 7 conditions (Tab C in S3 Table), we generally did not observe hybrids with positive best-parent heterosis (BPH, Tab D in S3 Table), except for rare cases involving maltose utilization and growth rate during diauxic shift, where 2 and 5 hybrids, respectively, displayed positive values (Fig 1C). Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", "The S. cerevisiae IRA2 polymorphism was validated by Sanger sequencing. PCR products were purified and sequenced by KIGene, Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). The presence of the SNP in the evolved hybrid strains was checked by visual inspection of the electropherograms. Null mutants for the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome were generated using CRISPR-Cas9  as previously described . Briefly, the gRNAs were designed using the Benchling online tool (https://www.benchling.com/) and cloned into the pAEF5 plasmid , using standard \u201cGolden Gate Assembly\u201d . Ancestral and evolved hybrids were co-transformed with the pAEF5 plasmid carrying the gRNA and the Cas9 gene, together with a double-stranded DNA fragment (donor DNA). The donor DNA contained nourseothricin (NAT) resistance cassette, obtained from the pAG25 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #35121), flanked with sequences of the target allele, corresponding to 50-pb upstream of start codon and 50-pb downstream of the stop codon", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "- 79.

We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "IRA2 gene validation", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "To compare the aroma profile of the H3-4-C1evolved hybrid to the lager strain, we identified volatile compounds (VCs) by HS-SPME-GC-MS in the fermented wort. This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", "(A) Mean relative fitness and statistical analysis for maximum CO2 loss of each of the evolved lines in maltose and maltose/maltotriose relative to unevolved hybrid.

The fitness increase of each the 28 evolved line was determined as the ratio between the phenotypic value of a given line and the equivalent of its respective ancestral hybrid.", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", "To detect additional genetic changes not identified in the individual clones and to track the relative frequencies of the de novo mutations in the evolution lines, we sequenced whole population samples at increasing time points of experimental evolution (at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 generations; S8 Fig and Tabs D and E in S8 Table). In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "- 34.

We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table).

We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A).

We used experimental evolution and selection on desirable traits to enhance the fermentation profiles of novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.

Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids.

We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", ". eubayanus mitochondria exhibited greater evolutionary potential and superior fitness post-evolution, analogous to commercial lager hybrids. Using genome-wide screens of the parental subgenomes, we identified genetic changes in IRA2, IMA1, and MALX genes that influence maltose metabolism, and increase glycolytic flux and sugar consumption in the evolved hybrids. Functional validation and transcriptome analyses confirmed increased maltose-related gene expression, influencing greater maltotriose consumption in evolved hybrids. This study demonstrates the potential for generating industrially viable lager yeast hybrids from wild Patagonian strains. Our hybridization, evolution, and mitochondrial selection approach produced hybrids with high fermentation capacity and expands lager beer brewing options.", "Since S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus show divergence greater than 20% we could not detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by mapping to a single parental reference. As both hybrids appear to have one copy of each parental genome with no aneuploidies, LOH should appear as a loss of coverage segments that can be detected as copy number losses. LOH regions were detected by mapping reads to the concatenated genome and we used CNVkit  to detect genomic segments (1000 bp windows) showing CNVs with log2FC less than -2. Comparisons were made between parental strains vs ancestral hybrids and between ancestral hybrids with evolved hybrids.\nRNA-seq analysis", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

A PCA analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of replicates was performed, after which two outlier replicates (H3-A replicate 3 and H3-E replicate 2) were removed. To analyze differences in allele expression, a list of 1-to-1 orthologous genes between both parental strains was identified using OMA . Orthologous genes that differ more than 5% on their gene lengths were excluded. The differential allelic expression of these orthologous genes was determined using design = ~parental, with parental being \u201cL3\u201d or \u201cCL710\u201d. Furthermore, orthologous genes that showed differential allele expression depending on the ancestral or evolved strain background were assessed using an interaction term (~ parental:condition), with condition being \u201cancestral\u201d or \u201cevolved\u201d.

Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "(A) Mean relative fitness (maximum OD600nm) of evolved lines after 250 generations to their respective ancestral hybrids under microculture conditions.

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. Volatile compound production was determined by using HeadSpace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) after 14 days of fermentation as previously described .\nPhenotypic characterization", "Hybrids and parental strains were phenotypically characterized under microculture conditions as previously described . Briefly, we estimated mitotic growth in 96-well plates containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) supplemented with 2% glucose, 2% maltose, 2% maltotriose, 2% glucose and 9% ethanol, 2% glucose and 10% sorbitol, and under carbon source switching (diauxic shift) from glucose to maltose as previously described . All conditions were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Lag phase, growth efficiency, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) were determined as previously described . For the diauxic shift between glucose and maltose, lag time and \u03bcmax were determined during growth in maltose. The parameters were calculated following curve fitting (OD values were transformed to ln) using the Gompertz function  in R (version 4.03).", "Mid-parent and best-parent heterosis were determined as previously described , using Eq 1 and 2, where mid-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the mid-parent performance and best-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the better parent phenotypic value .\n(1)(2)Experimental evolution", "Experimental evolution was carried out at 20\u00b0C under two different media conditions (M and T): 1) YNB + 2% maltose supplemented with 9% ethanol (M) and 2) YNB + 1% maltose + 1% maltotriose supplemented with 9% ethanol (T). Experimental evolution assays in maltose were performed in a final volume of 1 mL in 2 mL tubes, while those in maltose and maltotriose were performed in a 96-well plate under a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Each hybrid strain was first grown in 0.67% YNB medium with 2% maltose at 25\u00b0C for 24 h with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Each pre-inoculum was then used to inoculate each evolution line at an initial OD600nm of 0.1, with three replicate lines per strain in medium M and four replicate lines in medium T. Lines in medium M were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 72 h. Lines in medium T were incubated for 144 h at 20\u00b0C. After this, cultures were then serially transferred into fresh medium for an initial OD600nm of 0.1", ". Serial transfers were repeated for 250 generations in total (approximately seven months). The number of generations was determined using the formula log(final cells\u2013initial cells)/log2 . Population samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks after 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 generations. After 250 generations, three colonies were isolated for each replicate line on YPM solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% maltose and 2% agar) supplemented with 6% ethanol. The fastest growing colonies were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks.

Initially, three S. cerevisiae strains from vineyards were selected because they showed: i) the highest maximum CO2 loss in beer wort (S2A Fig and S2 Table), ii) the best growth performance under maltotriose conditions (S2B Fig), and iii) the most efficient maltotriose uptake during microculture conditions (S2C Fig). These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively.

We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A). To describe the phenotypic landscape of the 31 hybrids more comprehensively, we conducted a PCA analysis (Fig 1B)", ". The individual factor map shows that hybrids made at 20\u00b0C fall into the right upper quarter of the phenotype space, and are associated with a higher growth rate in media with maltose and glucose compared to hybrids made at 12\u00b0C.

Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA). We did not observe any hybrids exhibiting superior fermentative capacity when compared to their respective parental strains (S3 Fig), and there was no evidence for hybrid vigour according to best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients (Fig 1E and Tabs C and D in S4 Table).

From here on we will refer to these strains as H3-A, H4-A, H6-A, and H8-A (A for \u2018ancestral\u2019 or unevolved hybrid). These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig).

However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively).

This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain.

In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table).

In blue highlight transporters involved in sugar consumption.", "To determine the impact of these mutations and the CNVs in the transcriptome of the H3-E hybrid, we estimated transcript abundance under beer fermentative conditions in the evolved and non-evolved hybrid. We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) .

These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively.

We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A).

Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA).

These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig).

We did not observe a significant increase in CO2 production levels in the evolved lines of the H6-A and H8-A hybrids in either M or T media (Figs 2C and S6 and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively).

Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain.

Notably, the CO2 loss kinetics among these genotypes were comparable (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA), with genotype #1 from line H3-4 exhibiting the highest CO2 loss (Fig 3A). All these genotypes\u2019 fermentation profiles closely resembled that of the W34/70 commercial lager strain, underscoring the significantly high fermentative capacity of these novel hybrids (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig 3A). All genotypes consumed the maltotriose in the T medium completely (Tab A in S7 Table), and ethanol production ranged from 3.50% to 3.78% v/v (Fig 3B), which is similar to the commercial strain (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA).

This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "To identify mutations in evolved hybrids associated with their improved fermentative capacity, we sequenced the genomes of the two genotypes exhibiting the highest CO2 production levels, specifically H3-4-C1 and H4-1-C1 (from here on referred to as H3-E and H4-E; with \u2018E\u2019 for evolved hybrid) that were evolved in the maltose/maltotriose T medium (Tab A in S8 Table). Genome sequencing revealed that these two strain backgrounds had equal contributions from both parental genomes and that they had euploid, diploid genomes with no detectable aneuploidies (Tab B in S8 Table), containing the S. eubayanus mitochondria. We only detected small LOH regions that were associated with the hybridization process, mainly losses of S. eubayanus DNA at subtelomeric regions (Tab C in S8 Table) but also a small LOH region partly spanning the HKR1 gene located in chromosome II, between the H4-A hybrid compared with the CL216.1 parent (Tab C in S8 Table).", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". While in H4-E, we identified a missense mutation in MDS3 (a putative component of the TOR regulatory pathway), FSF1 (predicted to be an alpha-isopropyl malate carrier), and ASC1 (core component of the small ribosomal subunit) in the S. eubayanus subgenome, and an upstream gene mutation in SSK2 (MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG signalling pathway) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table).", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

The (*) represents different levels of significance between mutant and wild-type strains (Student t-test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001).", "To detect additional genetic changes not identified in the individual clones and to track the relative frequencies of the de novo mutations in the evolution lines, we sequenced whole population samples at increasing time points of experimental evolution (at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 generations; S8 Fig and Tabs D and E in S8 Table). In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7.

In blue highlight transporters involved in sugar consumption.", "To determine the impact of these mutations and the CNVs in the transcriptome of the H3-E hybrid, we estimated transcript abundance under beer fermentative conditions in the evolved and non-evolved hybrid. We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

To overcome this, the scientists employed experimental evolution \u2014 a process that mimics natural selection in a controlled environment. By subjecting the hybrids to different fermentation conditions over 250 generations, they pushed the hybrids beyond their original capacities. The hybrids were then elected based on their ability to thrive in environments with varying sugar content and ethanol levels, mimicking the challenging conditions of beer fermentation.\nNew yeast, new beer", "For brewers, the implications of these findings could be a game changer. The ability to craft beers with new flavors and aromas using these novel hybrids could open up a new market segment, appealing to craft beer enthusiasts and traditional lager lovers alike. The evolved hybrids have already shown fermentative capacities on par with, and in some cases exceeding, those of commercial strains. Moreover, their unique aroma profiles \u2014 ranging from sweet, fruity notes to more complex, spicy, and phenolic undertones \u2014 could diversify the sensory experiences offered by lagers.", "The results were striking. The hybrids demonstrated enhanced fermentation performance, especially in terms of maltose and maltotriose consumption \u2014 two sugars crucial for beer fermentation. This increased sugar consumption led to higher ethanol production and unique aroma profiles that distinguish these hybrids from their commercial counterparts. The researchers also identified the gene mutations that influence this fermentation.", "\u201cUntil a few years ago, it was impossible to create a new lager beer, simply because the maternal species of lager yeast, S. eubayanus, had not yet been discovered,\u201d writes Jennifer Molinet in The Conversation. \u201cBut in 2011, this species was found on the bark of trees in Patagonia, Argentina. Since then, hundreds of strains have been isolated from Chilean and Argentinian forests, carrying a stunning amount of genetic diversity.\u201d\nA new study co-authored by Molinet leveraged three distinct Patagonian S. eubayanus lineages to expand the repertoire of lager yeast. Researchers combined these wild strains with S. cerevisiae through experimental evolution and selection processes. These enabled them to enhance desirable traits, such as fermentation efficiency and unique aroma profiles, in these novel hybrids.", "In the past, researchers have managed to genetically engineer yeasts to produce variations, but GMO beer didn\u2019t prove too popular with consumers. This research promises to broaden the toolkit of brewers, leading to the development of yeast strains that are not only more efficient but also capable of producing a wider array of flavors and aromas. It represents a significant step forward from the genetically limited strains that have dominated the market for centuries.\nJournal Reference: Jennifer Molinet et al, Wild Patagonian yeast improve the evolutionary potential of novel interspecific hybrid strains for lager brewing, PLOS Genetics (2024). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154", "Lager beer (the crisp, cold-fermented, fizzy beer) dominates the global beer market. Around 90% of the world\u2019s beer varieties are lager. But lagers are constrained by a surprisingly narrow genetic pool \u2014 the genetic pool of yeast.\nExpanding the pool\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why lagers taste so similar to one another, it\u2019s because of the yeast. The vast majority of beers use a limited number of yeast strains. Primarily they use Saccharomyces pastorianus, a hybrid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus. This restricted genetic diversity has confined the range of flavors and aromas in beer.

According to a study published in PLOS Genetics, Patagonian yeast is a type of wild yeast found in the biodiverse region of Patagonia, Chile. This yeast strain was found to have a high genetic diversity, making it suitable for brewing lager beer with novel flavors. This is because genetic diversity allows for more fermentation qualities and influences the final taste of the beer.\n\nAdditionally, Victoria Lobos, the founder of Patagonia Yeast, has utilized her scientific expertise to establish a yeast lab and consult with various beer, wine, and cider producers. She has also conducted courses on microbiology and fermentation management for brewers. Through her research and consulting, she has found that Patagonian yeast has the potential to improve the evolutionary potential of interspecific hybrid strains for lager brewing, as mentioned in the PLOS Genetics study.\n\nFurthermore, a study published in Abstract magazine highlights the untapped potential of Patagonian yeast for the craft beer industry. The article notes that commercial lager yeast strains have limited genetic diversity, leading to a narrow range of flavors in beer. However, the genetic diversity of Patagonian yeast could potentially lead to new brewing applications and enhance the overall beer experience.\n\nIn summary, Patagonian yeast's origin in the biodiverse region of Patagonia, high genetic diversity, and potential to influence fermentation qualities make it a suitable candidate for producing unique flavors in lager beer.", "user_utterance": "Can you explain the origin and unique characteristics of Patagonian yeast that make it suitable for brewing lager beer?", "search_queries": ["What is Patagonian yeast?", "Where is Patagonian yeast found?", "What is the genetic diversity of Patagonian yeast?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.beer52.com/ferment/article/1628/patagonian-yeast", "description": "This yeast was discovered in a mushroom growing on Patagonia\u2019s south beech trees, and is believed to have hybridised in such a way that its progeny inherited eubayanus\u2019s cold resistance.

So if you use less yeast to make fermentation cheaper, you\u2019re actually making the yeast you do use less effective.", "With the climate in which this berry grows seeing a daily temperature fluctuation of 5-250C, any bacteria, fungi or yeast that coexists with it must be able to function consistently at a wide range of temperatures, a characteristic which \u2013 if the popularity of nova and kveik is anything to go by \u2013 is desirable in a brewers\u2019 yeast these days. Compounding this, the yeast is also wildly versatile; by not producing bold esters, Victoria tells me this medium-to-high attenuating yeast can bring a gentle balance to everything from a golden ale, to an IPA.", "Her journey to Patagonia Yeast has taken her through some of the world\u2019s most prestigious universities, labs, and biotech companies, but it has also taken her the length and breadth of Chile.

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. Volatile compound production was determined by using HeadSpace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) after 14 days of fermentation as previously described .\nPhenotypic characterization", "Hybrids and parental strains were phenotypically characterized under microculture conditions as previously described .

All conditions were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Lag phase, growth efficiency, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) were determined as previously described . For the diauxic shift between glucose and maltose, lag time and \u03bcmax were determined during growth in maltose. The parameters were calculated following curve fitting (OD values were transformed to ln) using the Gompertz function  in R (version 4.03).", "Mid-parent and best-parent heterosis were determined as previously described , using Eq 1 and 2, where mid-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the mid-parent performance and best-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the better parent phenotypic value .\n(1)(2)Experimental evolution", "Experimental evolution was carried out at 20\u00b0C under two different media conditions (M and T): 1) YNB + 2% maltose supplemented with 9% ethanol (M) and 2) YNB + 1% maltose + 1% maltotriose supplemented with 9% ethanol (T). Experimental evolution assays in maltose were performed in a final volume of 1 mL in 2 mL tubes, while those in maltose and maltotriose were performed in a 96-well plate under a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Each hybrid strain was first grown in 0.67% YNB medium with 2% maltose at 25\u00b0C for 24 h with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Each pre-inoculum was then used to inoculate each evolution line at an initial OD600nm of 0.1, with three replicate lines per strain in medium M and four replicate lines in medium T. Lines in medium M were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 72 h. Lines in medium T were incubated for 144 h at 20\u00b0C. After this, cultures were then serially transferred into fresh medium for an initial OD600nm of 0.1", ". Serial transfers were repeated for 250 generations in total (approximately seven months). The number of generations was determined using the formula log(final cells\u2013initial cells)/log2 . Population samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks after 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 generations. After 250 generations, three colonies were isolated for each replicate line on YPM solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% maltose and 2% agar) supplemented with 6% ethanol. The fastest growing colonies were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks.

As an additional filtering step, the ancestral and evolved vcf files were intersected using BCFtools 1.3.1  and variants with shared positions were extracted from the vcf files of the evolved hybrids. Annotation and effect prediction of the variants were performed with SnpEff .", "We used sppIDer  to assess the proportional genomic contribution of each species to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in each sequenced hybrid. In addition, we used the tool to identify potential aneuploidies within these genomes. CNVs were called using CNVkit (\u2014method wgs,\u2014-target-avg-size 1000) . As the analysis was performed on a haploid reference (both parental genomes were present), a CNV of log2 = 1 corresponds to a duplication.", "Since S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus show divergence greater than 20% we could not detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by mapping to a single parental reference. As both hybrids appear to have one copy of each parental genome with no aneuploidies, LOH should appear as a loss of coverage segments that can be detected as copy number losses. LOH regions were detected by mapping reads to the concatenated genome and we used CNVkit  to detect genomic segments (1000 bp windows) showing CNVs with log2FC less than -2. Comparisons were made between parental strains vs ancestral hybrids and between ancestral hybrids with evolved hybrids.\nRNA-seq analysis", "Gene expression analysis was performed on ancestral and evolved hybrid strains H3-A and H3-E.

To account for mapping bias due to the different genetic distances of the parental strains to their reference strains, the L3 and CL710.1 parental strains were re-sequenced using WGS, after which genomic reads were mapped with BWA  to the DBVPG6765 and CL216 references and SNPs were called using freebayes . These SNPs were used to correct the hybrid genome sequence using the GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool.

Counts were further analyzed in R using de DESeq package ", ". A PCA analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of replicates was performed, after which two outlier replicates (H3-A replicate 3 and H3-E replicate 2) were removed. To analyze differences in allele expression, a list of 1-to-1 orthologous genes between both parental strains was identified using OMA . Orthologous genes that differ more than 5% on their gene lengths were excluded. The differential allelic expression of these orthologous genes was determined using design = ~parental, with parental being \u201cL3\u201d or \u201cCL710\u201d.

The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively. All strains were able to sporulate (Tab C in S2 Table).", "Nine interspecific F1 hybrid crosses were performed through spore-to-spore mating at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, to promote the preservation of the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described (S1 Fig) . We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A). To describe the phenotypic landscape of the 31 hybrids more comprehensively, we conducted a PCA analysis (Fig 1B)", ". The individual factor map shows that hybrids made at 20\u00b0C fall into the right upper quarter of the phenotype space, and are associated with a higher growth rate in media with maltose and glucose compared to hybrids made at 12\u00b0C. This was particularly the case for four hybrid strains (H1, H3, H4 and H6), involving parental strains L3, L270, CL216.1 and CL710.1 (all p-values < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S3 Table).", "A) Hierarchically clustered heatmap of phenotypic diversity of 31 interspecific hybrid strains under microculture conditions.

(E) Best-parent heterosis in the 31 interspecific hybrids evaluated under fermentation conditions at 12\u00b0C.", "To assess the impact of hybridization on yeast fitness, we calculated best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients across the 31 hybrids (Fig 1C and Tabs C and D in S3 Table). While some hybrids exhibited positive mid-parent heterosis in 5 out 7 conditions (Tab C in S3 Table), we generally did not observe hybrids with positive best-parent heterosis (BPH, Tab D in S3 Table), except for rare cases involving maltose utilization and growth rate during diauxic shift, where 2 and 5 hybrids, respectively, displayed positive values (Fig 1C). Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA). We did not observe any hybrids exhibiting superior fermentative capacity when compared to their respective parental strains (S3 Fig), and there was no evidence for hybrid vigour according to best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients (Fig 1E and Tabs C and D in S4 Table). Neither parents nor hybrids reached the fermentative capacity of the commercial strain W34/70 (p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA).\nEvolved lines carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria exhibit a greater fitness under fermentation", "All results so far indicated that the de novo interspecific hybrids did not show any hybrid vigour, in none of the phenotypes assessed. We thus decided to subject hybrids to experimental evolution to enhance their fermentative capacity. We specifically selected four hybrids (H3.12\u20133, H4.12\u20134, H6.20\u20132, and H8.20\u20135) because they demonstrated the highest phenotypic values across kinetic parameters. From here on we will refer to these strains as H3-A, H4-A, H6-A, and H8-A (A for \u2018ancestral\u2019 or unevolved hybrid). These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig). All evolved lines significantly increased in fitness in at least one of the evolution media and/or kinetic parameters assessed compared to their respective ancestral hybrids (Fig 2A and Tabs A and B in S5 Table; p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, evolved lines from hybrids made at 12\u00b0C mating temperature (H3-A and H4-A) showed a more pronounced fitness increase in the T medium compared to those generated at 20\u00b0C (p-value = 3.327e-08, one-way ANOVA, Figs 2B and S4B), suggesting that hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria have greater potential for improvement than hybrids with S. cerevisiae mitochondria.

We did not observe a significant increase in CO2 production levels in the evolved lines of the H6-A and H8-A hybrids in either M or T media (Figs 2C and S6 and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively). Thus, both evolved hybrid lines generated at cold-temperature, carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria, showed a greater increase in CO2 production than hybrids carrying the S", ". cerevisiae mitochondria (Fig 2C). Specifically, hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria increased their maximum CO2 loss by 10.6% when evolving in M medium (p-value = 0.003698, one-way ANOVA) and by 13% in T medium (p-value = 1.328e-08, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2D). This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain. Interestingly, two genotypes deriving from H6-A (carrying the S. cerevisiae mitochondria) evolved in T medium also showed a CO2 loss similar to the commercial strain (p-value = 0.90372, one-way ANOVA).", "To focus more in-depth on the evolved lines with the highest fermentative capacity and carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria (H3-4 and H4-1 evolved in T medium, S7 Fig), we isolated three colonies from each of these two lines to evaluate their fermentative capabilities. Notably, the CO2 loss kinetics among these genotypes were comparable (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA), with genotype #1 from line H3-4 exhibiting the highest CO2 loss (Fig 3A). All these genotypes\u2019 fermentation profiles closely resembled that of the W34/70 commercial lager strain, underscoring the significantly high fermentative capacity of these novel hybrids (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig 3A). All genotypes consumed the maltotriose in the T medium completely (Tab A in S7 Table), and ethanol production ranged from 3.50% to 3.78% v/v (Fig 3B), which is similar to the commercial strain (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA).

This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "To identify mutations in evolved hybrids associated with their improved fermentative capacity, we sequenced the genomes of the two genotypes exhibiting the highest CO2 production levels, specifically H3-4-C1 and H4-1-C1 (from here on referred to as H3-E and H4-E; with \u2018E\u2019 for evolved hybrid) that were evolved in the maltose/maltotriose T medium (Tab A in S8 Table). Genome sequencing revealed that these two strain backgrounds had equal contributions from both parental genomes and that they had euploid, diploid genomes with no detectable aneuploidies (Tab B in S8 Table), containing the S. eubayanus mitochondria. We only detected small LOH regions that were associated with the hybridization process, mainly losses of S. eubayanus DNA at subtelomeric regions (Tab C in S8 Table) but also a small LOH region partly spanning the HKR1 gene located in chromosome II, between the H4-A hybrid compared with the CL216.1 parent (Tab C in S8 Table).", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". While in H4-E, we identified a missense mutation in MDS3 (a putative component of the TOR regulatory pathway), FSF1 (predicted to be an alpha-isopropyl malate carrier), and ASC1 (core component of the small ribosomal subunit) in the S. eubayanus subgenome, and an upstream gene mutation in SSK2 (MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG signalling pathway) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table).", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7.

We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

This tiny organism plays an outsized role in crafting the flavors and aromas that define many beloved beverages and foods. Its ability to undergo genetic exchange is a crucial factor that influences its behavior during fermentation.\nUnderstanding how genetic diversity in yeast affects these processes provides valuable insights into optimizing flavor profiles for various products.", "Temperature, for instance, is a critical factor in determining the rate and nature of fermentation. A warmer environment typically accelerates yeast activity, leading to faster sugar conversion but potentially altering the balance of flavor compounds produced. Conversely, cooler temperatures can slow the process, allowing for the development of more nuanced and complex flavors. This delicate balance requires careful monitoring to achieve the desired sensory outcomes in products like beer, wine, and spirits.\nNutrient availability also influences fermentation characteristics, as yeast relies on a variety of nutrients to thrive and perform optimally. The presence of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids can significantly affect yeast health and metabolism, impacting the efficiency of fermentation and the quality of the final product. Producers often adjust nutrient levels to ensure robust yeast performance and to steer the fermentation toward specific flavor profiles.", "Crafting these hybrids involves leveraging the natural propensity of yeast to undergo genetic mixing. Specialized techniques, such as protoplast fusion, can facilitate this process by allowing the cytoplasmic contents of two different strains to merge. The resulting hybrids can be screened for desirable traits, such as increased alcohol tolerance or the ability to produce specific flavor compounds. This method of strain development offers a level of precision and predictability that is highly valued in commercial fermentation applications.", "Mating, a form of sexual reproduction in yeast, involves the fusion of two distinct cells, resulting in offspring with a combination of genetic material from both parents. This genetic recombination can introduce beneficial traits, such as improved stress tolerance or enhanced metabolic capabilities. Horizontal gene transfer, on the other hand, allows yeast to incorporate genetic material from unrelated organisms, further expanding its genetic repertoire. This process can occur through mechanisms like transformation, where yeast cells uptake free DNA from their surroundings.", "Fermentation conditions, such as oxygen levels and fermentation vessels, also contribute to the complexity of flavor profiles. Open fermentation allows for greater interaction with the environment, introducing subtle variations in taste and aroma that are not achievable in closed systems. The material of the fermentation vessel itself can impart unique characteristics, with wooden barrels, for example, infusing notes of vanilla or spice.", "The creation of yeast hybrids can be likened to a form of biological innovation, as it allows for the blending of desirable features from multiple strains into a single organism. This is particularly advantageous in industries such as brewing and winemaking, where specific flavor profiles and fermentation efficiencies are sought after. Hybrid strains provide an opportunity to combine robust fermentation capabilities with novel aromatic attributes, ultimately enhancing the sensory experience of the final product.", "The world of fermentation is a sensory playground where flavor profile variations are as diverse as the yeasts that create them. Each fermentation process offers a unique combination of taste and aroma, shaped by the interplay of yeast strains, substrates, and environmental factors. These variations are particularly evident in the brewing and winemaking industries, where the choice of yeast strain can dramatically alter the final product\u2019s character.\nThe substrate, or the raw material used in fermentation, plays a significant role in determining flavor outcomes. Different grains, fruits, or other fermentable sources impart distinct base notes that interact with yeast-derived compounds. For instance, the use of malted barley in beer production provides a rich canvas of caramel and biscuity flavors, which can be accentuated or subdued by the yeast\u2019s metabolic activities.", "The intricate dance of yeast during fermentation is a testament to its remarkable adaptability. At the heart of this process lies the yeast\u2019s ability to interact with its environment, converting sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide while also producing a myriad of secondary metabolites. These byproducts are what contribute to the distinctive flavors and aromas that make each fermented product unique. The conditions under which fermentation occurs\u2014such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability\u2014play a significant role in shaping these characteristics.", "The implications of genetic exchange extend beyond mere survival. In the context of fermentation, these genetic variations can significantly impact the metabolic pathways yeast employs, ultimately influencing the production of flavor compounds. For instance, certain genetic combinations may enhance the production of esters, which contribute fruity notes to beverages like beer and wine. By understanding and harnessing these genetic exchanges, producers can tailor fermentation processes to achieve desired flavor profiles.\nIn the dynamic landscape of yeast fermentation, hybridization emerges as an intriguing phenomenon that introduces an additional layer of complexity and potential. This process involves the combination of genetic material from different yeast strains, resulting in hybrids that can exhibit unique characteristics. These hybrids often demonstrate traits that are not present in the parent strains, offering a valuable tool for optimizing fermentation outcomes.", "The process of genetic exchange in yeast is a fascinating mechanism that contributes to its adaptability and resilience. This exchange occurs through various methods, including mating and horizontal gene transfer, allowing yeast to acquire new genetic material.

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate.

These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively.

We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A).

These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig).

However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively).

Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig).

We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7. Coding genes located within bins showing CNV calls higher than 1 copy (yellow rectangles) are shown. (B) Volcano plot showing differential expressed genes (DEGs) between H3-E and H3-A hybrids.

(D) Model depicting genes exhibiting mutations after the experimental evolution assay (highlighted in orange) and involved in pathways related to the detection, regulation, uptake, and catabolism of maltotriose. Phosphorylation is indicated in red. In blue highlight transporters involved in sugar consumption.", "To determine the impact of these mutations and the CNVs in the transcriptome of the H3-E hybrid, we estimated transcript abundance under beer fermentative conditions in the evolved and non-evolved hybrid. We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

The recent finding of diverse S. eubayanus lineages from Patagonia offers potential for generating new lager yeasts with different flavour profiles. Here, we leverage the natural genetic diversity of S. eubayanus and expand the lager yeast repertoire by including three distinct Patagonian S. eubayanus lineages. We used experimental evolution and selection on desirable traits to enhance the fermentation profiles of novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids. Our analyses reveal an intricate interplay of pre-existing diversity, selection on species-specific mitochondria, de-novo mutations, and gene copy variations in sugar metabolism genes, resulting in high ethanol production and unique aroma profiles. Hybrids with S", ". eubayanus mitochondria exhibited greater evolutionary potential and superior fitness post-evolution, analogous to commercial lager hybrids. Using genome-wide screens of the parental subgenomes, we identified genetic changes in IRA2, IMA1, and MALX genes that influence maltose metabolism, and increase glycolytic flux and sugar consumption in the evolved hybrids. Functional validation and transcriptome analyses confirmed increased maltose-related gene expression, influencing greater maltotriose consumption in evolved hybrids. This study demonstrates the potential for generating industrially viable lager yeast hybrids from wild Patagonian strains. Our hybridization, evolution, and mitochondrial selection approach produced hybrids with high fermentation capacity and expands lager beer brewing options.", "Author summary", "Lager beer dominates the global market, accounting for over 90% of commercial beer varieties.

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. Volatile compound production was determined by using HeadSpace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) after 14 days of fermentation as previously described .\nPhenotypic characterization", "Hybrids and parental strains were phenotypically characterized under microculture conditions as previously described . Briefly, we estimated mitotic growth in 96-well plates containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) supplemented with 2% glucose, 2% maltose, 2% maltotriose, 2% glucose and 9% ethanol, 2% glucose and 10% sorbitol, and under carbon source switching (diauxic shift) from glucose to maltose as previously described . All conditions were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Lag phase, growth efficiency, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) were determined as previously described . For the diauxic shift between glucose and maltose, lag time and \u03bcmax were determined during growth in maltose. The parameters were calculated following curve fitting (OD values were transformed to ln) using the Gompertz function  in R (version 4.03).", "Mid-parent and best-parent heterosis were determined as previously described , using Eq 1 and 2, where mid-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the mid-parent performance and best-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the better parent phenotypic value .\n(1)(2)Experimental evolution", "Experimental evolution was carried out at 20\u00b0C under two different media conditions (M and T): 1) YNB + 2% maltose supplemented with 9% ethanol (M) and 2) YNB + 1% maltose + 1% maltotriose supplemented with 9% ethanol (T). Experimental evolution assays in maltose were performed in a final volume of 1 mL in 2 mL tubes, while those in maltose and maltotriose were performed in a 96-well plate under a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Each hybrid strain was first grown in 0.67% YNB medium with 2% maltose at 25\u00b0C for 24 h with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Each pre-inoculum was then used to inoculate each evolution line at an initial OD600nm of 0.1, with three replicate lines per strain in medium M and four replicate lines in medium T. Lines in medium M were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 72 h. Lines in medium T were incubated for 144 h at 20\u00b0C. After this, cultures were then serially transferred into fresh medium for an initial OD600nm of 0.1", ". Serial transfers were repeated for 250 generations in total (approximately seven months). The number of generations was determined using the formula log(final cells\u2013initial cells)/log2 . Population samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks after 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 generations. After 250 generations, three colonies were isolated for each replicate line on YPM solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% maltose and 2% agar) supplemented with 6% ethanol. The fastest growing colonies were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. The fitness increase of each the 28 evolved line was determined as the ratio between the phenotypic value of a given line and the equivalent of its respective ancestral hybrid.", "Genomic characterization", "Genomic DNA was obtained for whole-genome sequencing using the YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research, USA) and sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq500 following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Variant calling and filtering were done with GATK version 4.3.0.0 . Briefly, cleaned reads were mapped to a concatenated reference genome consisting of S. cerevisiae strain DBVPG6765  and S. eubayanus strain CL216.1  using BWA mem 0.7.17 , after which output bam files were sorted and indexed using Samtools 1.13 . Variants were called per sample using HaplotypeCaller (default settings) generating g.vcf files. Variant databases were built using GenomicsDBImport and genotypes were called using GenotypeGVCFs (-G StandardAnnotation). SNPs and INDELs were extracted and filtered out separately using SelectVariants. We then applied recommended filters with the following options: QD < 2.0, FS > 60.0, MQ < 40.0, SOR > 4.0, MQRankSum < -12.5, ReadPosRankSum < -8.0", ". This vcf file was further filtered by removing missing data using the option\u2013max-missing 1, filtering out sites with a coverage below 5th or above the 95th coverage sample percentile using the options\u2013min-meanDP and\u2013max-meanDP, and minimum site quality of 30 (\u2014minQ 30) in vcftools 0.1.16 . Sites with a mappability less than 1 calculated by GenMap 1.3.0  were filtered using bedtools 2.18 . As an additional filtering step, the ancestral and evolved vcf files were intersected using BCFtools 1.3.1  and variants with shared positions were extracted from the vcf files of the evolved hybrids. Annotation and effect prediction of the variants were performed with SnpEff .", "We used sppIDer  to assess the proportional genomic contribution of each species to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in each sequenced hybrid. In addition, we used the tool to identify potential aneuploidies within these genomes. CNVs were called using CNVkit (\u2014method wgs,\u2014-target-avg-size 1000) . As the analysis was performed on a haploid reference (both parental genomes were present), a CNV of log2 = 1 corresponds to a duplication.", "Since S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus show divergence greater than 20% we could not detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by mapping to a single parental reference. As both hybrids appear to have one copy of each parental genome with no aneuploidies, LOH should appear as a loss of coverage segments that can be detected as copy number losses. LOH regions were detected by mapping reads to the concatenated genome and we used CNVkit  to detect genomic segments (1000 bp windows) showing CNVs with log2FC less than -2. Comparisons were made between parental strains vs ancestral hybrids and between ancestral hybrids with evolved hybrids.\nRNA-seq analysis", "Gene expression analysis was performed on ancestral and evolved hybrid strains H3-A and H3-E. RNA was obtained and processed after 24 h under beer wort fermentation in triplicates, using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA kit I (OMEGA) as previously described . Total RNA was recovered using the RNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research). RNA integrity was confirmed using a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent). Illumina sequencing was performed in NextSeq500 platform.", "Reads quality was evaluated using the fastqc tool (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and processed using fastp (-3 l 40) . Reads were mapped to a concatenated fasta file of the DBVPG6765 and CL216.1 genome sequences. To account for mapping bias due to the different genetic distances of the parental strains to their reference strains, the L3 and CL710.1 parental strains were re-sequenced using WGS, after which genomic reads were mapped with BWA  to the DBVPG6765 and CL216 references and SNPs were called using freebayes . These SNPs were used to correct the hybrid genome sequence using the GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool. RNAseq reads were mapped to this hybrid reference using STAR (-outSAMmultNmax 1, -outMultimapperOrder random) . Counts were obtained with featureCounts using a concatenated annotation file . Counts were further analyzed in R using de DESeq package ", ". A PCA analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of replicates was performed, after which two outlier replicates (H3-A replicate 3 and H3-E replicate 2) were removed. To analyze differences in allele expression, a list of 1-to-1 orthologous genes between both parental strains was identified using OMA . Orthologous genes that differ more than 5% on their gene lengths were excluded. The differential allelic expression of these orthologous genes was determined using design = ~parental, with parental being \u201cL3\u201d or \u201cCL710\u201d. Furthermore, orthologous genes that showed differential allele expression depending on the ancestral or evolved strain background were assessed using an interaction term (~ parental:condition), with condition being \u201cancestral\u201d or \u201cevolved\u201d. Finally, to evaluate differences between ancestral and evolved hybrid strains, all 11,047 hybrid genes (5,508 S. eubayanus and 5,539 S. cerevisiae) were individually tested for differential expression using DESeq2", ". Overall gene expression differences were evaluated using the design ~condition. For all analyzes an FDR < 0.05 was used to consider statistical differences. GO term enrichment analyzes on differentially expressed genes were calculated using the package TOPGO .", "IRA2 gene validation", "The S. cerevisiae IRA2 polymorphism was validated by Sanger sequencing. PCR products were purified and sequenced by KIGene, Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). The presence of the SNP in the evolved hybrid strains was checked by visual inspection of the electropherograms. Null mutants for the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome were generated using CRISPR-Cas9  as previously described . Briefly, the gRNAs were designed using the Benchling online tool (https://www.benchling.com/) and cloned into the pAEF5 plasmid , using standard \u201cGolden Gate Assembly\u201d . Ancestral and evolved hybrids were co-transformed with the pAEF5 plasmid carrying the gRNA and the Cas9 gene, together with a double-stranded DNA fragment (donor DNA). The donor DNA contained nourseothricin (NAT) resistance cassette, obtained from the pAG25 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #35121), flanked with sequences of the target allele, corresponding to 50-pb upstream of start codon and 50-pb downstream of the stop codon", ". Correct gene deletion was confirmed by standard colony PCR. All primers, gRNAs, and donor DNA are listed in Tab B in S1 Table.", "FACS analysis", "DNA content was assessed through the propidium iodide (PI) staining assay, as previously described . Initially, cells were recovered from glycerol stocks on YPD solid media and allowed to grow overnight at 25\u00b0C. Subsequently, a portion of each patch was transferred into liquid YPD media and incubated overnight at 25\u00b0C. Then, 1 ml of each culture was harvested and suspended in 2.3 ml of cold 70% ethanol for fixation during 48h h at 4\u00b0C. Following fixation, cells were washed with sodium citrate (50 mM, pH 7) and 100 \u03bcl of cells resuspended in the same solution, and 1 \u03bcL of RNAse A (100 mg/mL) were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with a solution containing PI (final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL) and sodium citrate (50 mM, pH 7), and incubated for 40 min at room temperature in darkness. Analysis was conducted on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and fluorescence collection using an FL2-A filter, analyzing ten thousand cells per sample", ". Three strains with known ploidy (two S. cerevisiae -n and 2n- and one S. pastorianus -4n-) were employed as controls.", "Statistical analysis\nData visualization and statistical analyses were performed with R software version 4.03. Maximum specific growth rates and total CO2 loss were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences between the mean values of three replicates were tested using Student\u2019s t-test and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A p-value less than 0.05 (p<0.05) was considered statistically significant. Heatmaps were generated using the ComplexHeatmap package version 2.6.2. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on phenotypic data using the FactoMineR package version 2.4 and the factoextra package version 1.07 for extracting, visualizing and interpreting the results.\nResults\nDe novo S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus F1 hybrids show similar phenotypes as their parental strains", "The S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a previously described collection of Chilean isolates by Martinez et al.  and Nespolo, Villarroel et al. , respectively (Tab A in S1 Table). Initially, three S. cerevisiae strains from vineyards were selected because they showed: i) the highest maximum CO2 loss in beer wort (S2A Fig and S2 Table), ii) the best growth performance under maltotriose conditions (S2B Fig), and iii) the most efficient maltotriose uptake during microculture conditions (S2C Fig). These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively. All strains were able to sporulate (Tab C in S2 Table).", "Nine interspecific F1 hybrid crosses were performed through spore-to-spore mating at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, to promote the preservation of the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described (S1 Fig) . We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A). To describe the phenotypic landscape of the 31 hybrids more comprehensively, we conducted a PCA analysis (Fig 1B)", ". The individual factor map shows that hybrids made at 20\u00b0C fall into the right upper quarter of the phenotype space, and are associated with a higher growth rate in media with maltose and glucose compared to hybrids made at 12\u00b0C. This was particularly the case for four hybrid strains (H1, H3, H4 and H6), involving parental strains L3, L270, CL216.1 and CL710.1 (all p-values < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S3 Table).", "A) Hierarchically clustered heatmap of phenotypic diversity of 31 interspecific hybrid strains under microculture conditions.

(E) Best-parent heterosis in the 31 interspecific hybrids evaluated under fermentation conditions at 12\u00b0C.", "To assess the impact of hybridization on yeast fitness, we calculated best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients across the 31 hybrids (Fig 1C and Tabs C and D in S3 Table). While some hybrids exhibited positive mid-parent heterosis in 5 out 7 conditions (Tab C in S3 Table), we generally did not observe hybrids with positive best-parent heterosis (BPH, Tab D in S3 Table), except for rare cases involving maltose utilization and growth rate during diauxic shift, where 2 and 5 hybrids, respectively, displayed positive values (Fig 1C). Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA). We did not observe any hybrids exhibiting superior fermentative capacity when compared to their respective parental strains (S3 Fig), and there was no evidence for hybrid vigour according to best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients (Fig 1E and Tabs C and D in S4 Table). Neither parents nor hybrids reached the fermentative capacity of the commercial strain W34/70 (p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA).\nEvolved lines carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria exhibit a greater fitness under fermentation", "All results so far indicated that the de novo interspecific hybrids did not show any hybrid vigour, in none of the phenotypes assessed. We thus decided to subject hybrids to experimental evolution to enhance their fermentative capacity. We specifically selected four hybrids (H3.12\u20133, H4.12\u20134, H6.20\u20132, and H8.20\u20135) because they demonstrated the highest phenotypic values across kinetic parameters. From here on we will refer to these strains as H3-A, H4-A, H6-A, and H8-A (A for \u2018ancestral\u2019 or unevolved hybrid). These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig). All evolved lines significantly increased in fitness in at least one of the evolution media and/or kinetic parameters assessed compared to their respective ancestral hybrids (Fig 2A and Tabs A and B in S5 Table; p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, evolved lines from hybrids made at 12\u00b0C mating temperature (H3-A and H4-A) showed a more pronounced fitness increase in the T medium compared to those generated at 20\u00b0C (p-value = 3.327e-08, one-way ANOVA, Figs 2B and S4B), suggesting that hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria have greater potential for improvement than hybrids with S. cerevisiae mitochondria.

We did not observe a significant increase in CO2 production levels in the evolved lines of the H6-A and H8-A hybrids in either M or T media (Figs 2C and S6 and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively). Thus, both evolved hybrid lines generated at cold-temperature, carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria, showed a greater increase in CO2 production than hybrids carrying the S", ". cerevisiae mitochondria (Fig 2C). Specifically, hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria increased their maximum CO2 loss by 10.6% when evolving in M medium (p-value = 0.003698, one-way ANOVA) and by 13% in T medium (p-value = 1.328e-08, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2D). This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain. Interestingly, two genotypes deriving from H6-A (carrying the S. cerevisiae mitochondria) evolved in T medium also showed a CO2 loss similar to the commercial strain (p-value = 0.90372, one-way ANOVA).", "To focus more in-depth on the evolved lines with the highest fermentative capacity and carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria (H3-4 and H4-1 evolved in T medium, S7 Fig), we isolated three colonies from each of these two lines to evaluate their fermentative capabilities. Notably, the CO2 loss kinetics among these genotypes were comparable (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA), with genotype #1 from line H3-4 exhibiting the highest CO2 loss (Fig 3A). All these genotypes\u2019 fermentation profiles closely resembled that of the W34/70 commercial lager strain, underscoring the significantly high fermentative capacity of these novel hybrids (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig 3A). All genotypes consumed the maltotriose in the T medium completely (Tab A in S7 Table), and ethanol production ranged from 3.50% to 3.78% v/v (Fig 3B), which is similar to the commercial strain (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). One genotype (H4-1-C3) showed a remarkable 7", ".1% increase in ethanol production compared to the commercial strain (Fig 3B, p-value = 0.001, one-way ANOVA).", "(A) Maximum CO2 loss (g/L) for three different isolated genotypes (C1-C3) from evolved lines H3-4 and H4-1, ancestral hybrids (H3-A and H4-A) and commercial lager strain (W34/70).

The (*) represents different levels of significance between hybrids and commercial lager strains (Student t-test, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001).", "To compare the aroma profile of the H3-4-C1evolved hybrid to the lager strain, we identified volatile compounds (VCs) by HS-SPME-GC-MS in the fermented wort. This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "To identify mutations in evolved hybrids associated with their improved fermentative capacity, we sequenced the genomes of the two genotypes exhibiting the highest CO2 production levels, specifically H3-4-C1 and H4-1-C1 (from here on referred to as H3-E and H4-E; with \u2018E\u2019 for evolved hybrid) that were evolved in the maltose/maltotriose T medium (Tab A in S8 Table). Genome sequencing revealed that these two strain backgrounds had equal contributions from both parental genomes and that they had euploid, diploid genomes with no detectable aneuploidies (Tab B in S8 Table), containing the S. eubayanus mitochondria. We only detected small LOH regions that were associated with the hybridization process, mainly losses of S. eubayanus DNA at subtelomeric regions (Tab C in S8 Table) but also a small LOH region partly spanning the HKR1 gene located in chromosome II, between the H4-A hybrid compared with the CL216.1 parent (Tab C in S8 Table).", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". While in H4-E, we identified a missense mutation in MDS3 (a putative component of the TOR regulatory pathway), FSF1 (predicted to be an alpha-isopropyl malate carrier), and ASC1 (core component of the small ribosomal subunit) in the S. eubayanus subgenome, and an upstream gene mutation in SSK2 (MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG signalling pathway) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table).", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

The (*) represents different levels of significance between mutant and wild-type strains (Student t-test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001).", "To detect additional genetic changes not identified in the individual clones and to track the relative frequencies of the de novo mutations in the evolution lines, we sequenced whole population samples at increasing time points of experimental evolution (at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 generations; S8 Fig and Tabs D and E in S8 Table). In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7.

In blue highlight transporters involved in sugar consumption.", "To determine the impact of these mutations and the CNVs in the transcriptome of the H3-E hybrid, we estimated transcript abundance under beer fermentative conditions in the evolved and non-evolved hybrid. We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

They will also explore the different variations of lager that could benefit from this discovery.", "dlg_turns": [{"agent_utterance": "There have been significant historical developments in lager brewing that have shaped its current practices. The traditional production of alcoholic beverages using yeast has been a practice for thousands of years, and yeast has been a key ingredient in creating the unique aroma and flavor profiles of beer. Lager, a type of beer that is brewed and conditioned at low temperatures, has its origins in Germany in the 1400s when a new bottom-fermentation process was developed using cooler temperatures and ice to keep the beer cool during the summer months. This process gave rise to the term \"lager\", meaning \"to store\" in German. Today, lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer.\n\nOne of the key factors that differentiates lager from other types of beer is the use of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a \"bottom-fermenting\" yeast that ferments at relatively cool temperatures. This is a key element in creating the crisp and refreshing taste of lager beer. While this yeast is a hybrid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and a wild ancestor, S. eubayanus, it was not until 2011 that scientists discovered the wild ancestor and gained a better understanding of how S. cerevisiae evolved to create a cold-dwelling species.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of wild yeast strains to create new and unique beer flavors. This has led to studies such as the one led by Jennifer Molinet and her team, which focuses on the natural genetic diversity of wild yeast from Patagonia and its potential to enhance the fermentation qualities of lager. This research is exciting for the craft beer industry, as it opens up new possibilities for brewers to innovate and create new and interesting beer profiles.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of yeast in beer brewing has a rich history, and the development of lager brewing has been shaped by a combination of traditional practices and scientific advancements.", "user_utterance": "What are the key historical developments in lager brewing that have shaped its current practices?", "search_queries": ["history of lager brewing", "evolution of lager yeast strains", "role of yeast in beer fermentation"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/role-beer-yeast-brewing", "description": "During fermentation, the primary beer yeast species, known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces energy for its cellular metabolism by converting certain sugars into carbon dioxide, alcohols and fermentation by-products. Brewers in the middle ages had no idea about the presence of yeast and the role it plays in beer production.", "snippets": ["\"Wild\" fermented beers like Lambics, mixed-fermentation sour beers and wild specialty beers employ an array of yeast and bacteria found in the surrounding environment. The fermentation may involve a wild yeast such as Brettanomyces that imparts intriguing leather, sweat, and horse blanket notes. Lambics and beer styles such as Flanders Red Ale, Berliner Weisse and Gose owe their crisp sourness to the work of acid-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Pediococcus.\nDespite being such simple cells, brewing yeast has been the subject of numerous doctoral theses and spawned significant breakthroughs in cellular metabolism, genetics, lab procedures and biochemistry. Most people are simply thrilled with the fact that brewer's yeast has blessed us with the ability to produce the world's most popular alcoholic libation.\nWhen it comes to brewing beer, yeast plays a vital role, and one that no other organism on other can play.", "The wide array of different yeast strains and the impressive variety of flavors, textures and other characteristics than they can provide to a beer are paramount during the brewing process, and craft beer simply would not be the same without it.\nWell, it wouldn't exist for one thing, but think of the beautiful kaleidoscope of flavors that beer can provide and remember: None of them would be possible without yeast.", "Basically, two types of brewing yeast exist \u2013 classified originally on whether fermentation takes place at the top of the fermenter or near the bottom.\nBavarian Weissbiers arise from a type of ale yeast that works brilliantly in creating wheat beers that can offer complex notes of spice, clove, vanilla, bubblegum and banana that complement the cereal notes of the wheat. Brewers must take care to segregate the distinctive weissbier yeast from standard ale and lager yeasts used in the production of other beers.\nPrior to the mid-1800s, almost all beers were made using English ale yeast, but lager yeast soon became extremely popular after the invention of clear, golden pilsners and other stylish lager beers in the nineteenth century. Due to the worldwide popularity of light lager beers, lager yeast now produces the majority of the world's beer volume.", "Start 14-Day Trial Subscription\n*No credit card required\nThe fascinating microscopic organism that is yeast provides a tremendous impact on beer and brewing. Yeast plays a key role in creating the distinctive aroma and flavor components that make up an impressive variety of beer styles. Without the metabolism of yeast cells, the traditional production of alcoholic beverages would not be possible.\nYeasts are single-celled organisms with a nucleus that belong to the fungus kingdom. Unlike plant cells, yeast requires no sunlight, and the organism has been the catalyst used in baking and the creation of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. During fermentation, the primary beer yeast species, known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces energy for its cellular metabolism by converting certain sugars into carbon dioxide, alcohols and fermentation by-products.", "Ale yeast strains ferment best at temperatures in the range of 60 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. They are quite diverse in metabolism and in the production of fruity, spicy aroma and flavor compounds imparted to the finished beer. Think of a traditional English brewery using ale yeast in open fermentation vats at a rather cool ambient temperature. The beer ferments in just a few days, and the resulting English bitter style offers elegant notes of dried fruit, stone fruit and perhaps just a hint of butterscotch - all of which are fermentation by-products from the ale yeast.\nAle strains have a knack for excreting ester chemicals that can be perceived as various fruit notes. Being greatly influenced by temperature, ale yeast can experience a four-fold increase in ester production as a result of increasing fermentation temperature from 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Ales fermented at extremely warm temperatures will often exhibit intense fruitiness.", "Brewing yeast reproduces by way of simple sexual and asexual processes. Brewers appreciate yeast's ability to grow to a massive volume in just a few hours by the asexual cycle of \"budding.\" A small quantity of healthy yeast cells are added to the sugar water (wort) produced by soaking fermentable sugars out of malted grains like barley. Oxygen is introduced into the wort to jump-start the yeast's metabolism, and the yeast cells begin to take in the oxygen and feast on the sugars. The happy yeast cells immediately start to bud off new cells that also gorge themselves on sugar and reproduce at an astounding rate.\nWhen oxygen in the fermentation vessel is mostly absorbed by the yeast, the cells employ a simple version of anaerobic fermentation to produce the alcohol and carbon dioxide required in beer production. When most of the sugar is depleted in the beer, the yeast cells settle to the bottom of the fermenter, forming a thick layer that can be separated easily from the liquid.", "A tiny yeast cell is a fascinating example of primordial metabolism. In the proper environment, the cell absorbs sugar, oxygen and amino acids for cellular fuel. Yeasts, in turn, release ethanol, carbon dioxide and fruity esters as waste products. At times, beer yeast will also excrete organic acids, sulfur volatiles, spicy phenols, buttery diacetyl, fusel-type alcohols, and various other chemical components that may impact the aroma and flavor profile of the finished beer.", "Brewers in the middle ages had no idea about the presence of yeast and the role it plays in beer production. These rustic brewers would often stir a new vat of wort with a \"magic\" wooden paddle inoculated with yeast cells from previous batches. Fermentation would kick in within a few hours. Thankfully, modern brewers possess an intimate scientific knowledge of yeast types, metabolism, reproduction and flavor-production characteristics.\nBasically, two types of brewing yeast exist \u2013 classified originally on whether fermentation takes place at the top of the fermenter (top-fermenting) or near the bottom (bottom-fermenting). Beer yeast that prefers warmer temperatures and working near the top of the fermenter is known as \"ale\" yeast. Bavarian wheat beer yeast is also classified as a type of ale yeast. \"Lager\" yeast likes to hang out at the bottom of the fermenter and thrives in colder temperatures.", "Lager yeast was first used in Bavaria and then taken to Pilsen in the Czech Republic and Copenhagen in Denmark in the nineteenth century. Brewers often carried out fermentation and cold conditioning (lagering) in icy cellars or caves in the early days. Later, the Industrial Revolution's steam power, refrigeration, pasteurization and railways made it possible for brewers to employ lager yeast and market the resulting beers far and wide.\nMany lager beers are produced with a yeast variant called Saccharomyces carlsbergensis - a cross between classic Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a mysterious wild yeast strain. Recent genetic research shows that this fascinating wild strain probably came from Argentinian tree bark in chilly Patagonia that somehow made its way to Europe on early trading ships.", "Different yeast strains play an essential role in the creation of classic beer styles. Think of the clean, malt-forward character of lagers such as American Standard Lager, Czech Pale Lager and Bavarian lagers such as Helles, Dunkel, Bock, Festbier and M\u00e4rzen. In contrast, American and British ales offer light fruity notes from esters, and most craft beer fans love the complex, fruity, spicy notes of Belgian ales such as Dubbel, Tripel and Witbier. We've already touched on the appealing spice character of a Bavarian Weissbier. None of these qualities would be present without the magic of different yeasts.", "Lager yeast strains prefer to work in temperature ranges of 42 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit, so a Bavarian cave made the perfect environment for lager brewing and storage. Early brewers immediately noticed that the lager beer actually improved during weeks or months of cold storage in the caves. During extended periods of cold conditioning, lager yeasts tend to break down and metabolize esters and other ale-like fermentation compounds, producing beers that are more delicate, clean, crisp and less fruity and aromatic than ales.\nPrior to the mid-1800s, almost all beers were made using ale yeast, but lager yeast soon became extremely popular after the invention of clear, golden pilsners and other stylish lager beers in the nineteenth century."], "title": "The Role of Beer Yeast in Brewing - The Beer Connoisseur\u00ae"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager", "description": "A glass of lager from Bitburger, a German brewery.

The brewing process for this beer developed in the mid 19th century when Gabriel Sedlmayr took pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied it to existing lagering brewing methods.\nThis approach was picked up by other breweries, most notably Pilsner Urquell Brewery in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) where Josef Groll produced the first Pilsner beer. The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.\nAnother pale lager variety is Helles, native to Munich.[citation needed]\nAmber lager", "While prohibited by the German Reinheitsgebot tradition, lagers in some countries may include a proportion of adjuncts, usually rice or maize. Adjuncts entered United States brewing as a means of thinning out the body of beers, balancing the large quantities of protein introduced by six-row barley. Adjuncts are often used now in beermaking to introduce a large quantity of sugar, and thereby increase ABV, at a lower price than a formulation using an all-malt grain bill. There are, however, cases in which adjunct usage actually increases the cost of manufacture.\nIt is possible to use lager yeast in a warm fermentation process, such as with American steam beer; while German Altbier and K\u00f6lsch are brewed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae top-fermenting yeast at a warm temperature, but with a cold-storage finishing stage, and classified as oberg\u00e4riges lagerbier (top-fermented lager beer).\nVariations", "[edit]Until the 19th century, the German word Lagerbier (de) referred to all types of bottom-fermented, cool-conditioned beer in normal strengths. In Germany today, it mainly refers to beers from southern Germany, either \"Helles\" (pale) or \"Dunkles\" (dark). Pilsner, a more heavily hopped pale lager, is most often known as \"Pilsner\", \"Pilsener\", or \"Pils\". Other lagers are Bock, M\u00e4rzen, and Schwarzbier. In the United Kingdom, the term commonly refers to pale lagers derived from the Pilsner style.\nHistory of lager brewing\n[edit]While cold storage of beer, \"lagering\", in caves for example, was a common practice throughout the medieval period, bottom-fermenting yeast seems to have emerged from a hybridization in the early fifteenth century.\nIn 2011, a team of researchers claimed to have discovered that Saccharomyces eubayanus is responsible for creating the hybrid yeast used to make lager.", "A Vienna lager typically has a copper to reddish-brown colour, low bitterness, low hop profile, a malty aroma, and 4.8\u20135.4% alcohol by volume.\nDark lager\n[edit]Pale lagers were not common until the later part of the 19th century when the use of lighter roasted malts spread.[better source needed] Dark lagers may be called Dunkel, tmav\u00e9 or Schwarzbier depending on region, colour or brewing method.[citation needed]\nTmav\u00e9 is Czech for \"dark\" \u2013 beers which are so dark as to be black are termed \u010dern\u00e9 pivo, \"black beer\".

Lagers can be pale, amber, or dark. Pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer. The term \"lager\" comes from the German word for \"storage\", as the beer was stored before drinking, traditionally in the same cool caves in which it was fermented.\nAs well as maturation in cold storage, most lagers are distinguished by the use of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a \"bottom-fermenting\" yeast that ferments at relatively cold temperatures.\nEtymology", "Based on the numbers of breweries, lager brewing became the main form of brewing in the Kingdom of Bohemia between 1860 and 1870, as shown in the following table:\nIn the 19th century, before the advent of refrigeration, German brewers would dig cellars for lagering and fill them with ice from nearby lakes and rivers, which would cool the beer during the summer months. To further protect the cellars from the summer heat, they would plant chestnut trees, which have spreading, dense canopies but shallow roots which would not intrude on the caverns. The practice of serving beer at these sites evolved into the modern beer garden.", "The rise of lager was entwined with the development of refrigeration, as it made it possible to brew lager year-round (brewing in the summer had previously been banned in many locations across Germany), and efficient refrigeration also made it possible to brew lager in more places and keep it cold until serving. The first large-scale refrigerated lagering tanks were developed for Gabriel Sedelmayr's Spaten Brewery in Munich by Carl von Linde in 1870.\nProduction process\n[edit]Lager uses a process of cool fermentation, followed by maturation in cold storage. The German word \"Lager\" means storeroom or warehouse. The yeast generally used with lager brewing is Saccharomyces pastorianus. It is a close relative of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast used for warm fermented ales.[citation needed]", "[edit]Lagers range in colour from extremely pale, through amber beers such as Vienna lager, to dark brown and black Dunkel and Schwarzbier. The depth of colour comes from the specific grain bill used in the beers; paler lagers use unroasted barley and may even add other grains such as rice or corn to lighten the color and provide a crisp, bright finish to the flavour. Darker lagers use roasted grains and malts to produce a more roasted, even slightly burnt, flavour profile.\nPale lager\n[edit]The most common lagers in worldwide production are pale lagers. The flavour of these lighter lagers is usually mild, and the producers often recommend that the beers be served refrigerated.", "- ^ \"500 years ago, yeast's epic journey gave rise to lager beer\".

The fermentation environment, characterized by limited oxygen, high ethanol concentrations, and microbial competition for nutrients (typically yeasts, molds, and bacteria) can be considered stressful . One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. Volatile compound production was determined by using HeadSpace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) after 14 days of fermentation as previously described .\nPhenotypic characterization", "Hybrids and parental strains were phenotypically characterized under microculture conditions as previously described . Briefly, we estimated mitotic growth in 96-well plates containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) supplemented with 2% glucose, 2% maltose, 2% maltotriose, 2% glucose and 9% ethanol, 2% glucose and 10% sorbitol, and under carbon source switching (diauxic shift) from glucose to maltose as previously described . All conditions were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Lag phase, growth efficiency, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) were determined as previously described . For the diauxic shift between glucose and maltose, lag time and \u03bcmax were determined during growth in maltose. The parameters were calculated following curve fitting (OD values were transformed to ln) using the Gompertz function  in R (version 4.03).", "Mid-parent and best-parent heterosis were determined as previously described , using Eq 1 and 2, where mid-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the mid-parent performance and best-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the better parent phenotypic value .\n(1)(2)Experimental evolution", "Experimental evolution was carried out at 20\u00b0C under two different media conditions (M and T): 1) YNB + 2% maltose supplemented with 9% ethanol (M) and 2) YNB + 1% maltose + 1% maltotriose supplemented with 9% ethanol (T). Experimental evolution assays in maltose were performed in a final volume of 1 mL in 2 mL tubes, while those in maltose and maltotriose were performed in a 96-well plate under a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Each hybrid strain was first grown in 0.67% YNB medium with 2% maltose at 25\u00b0C for 24 h with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Each pre-inoculum was then used to inoculate each evolution line at an initial OD600nm of 0.1, with three replicate lines per strain in medium M and four replicate lines in medium T. Lines in medium M were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 72 h. Lines in medium T were incubated for 144 h at 20\u00b0C. After this, cultures were then serially transferred into fresh medium for an initial OD600nm of 0.1", ". Serial transfers were repeated for 250 generations in total (approximately seven months). The number of generations was determined using the formula log(final cells\u2013initial cells)/log2 . Population samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks after 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 generations. After 250 generations, three colonies were isolated for each replicate line on YPM solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% maltose and 2% agar) supplemented with 6% ethanol. The fastest growing colonies were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks.

Briefly, cleaned reads were mapped to a concatenated reference genome consisting of S. cerevisiae strain DBVPG6765  and S. eubayanus strain CL216.1  using BWA mem 0.7.17 , after which output bam files were sorted and indexed using Samtools 1.13 . Variants were called per sample using HaplotypeCaller (default settings) generating g.vcf files. Variant databases were built using GenomicsDBImport and genotypes were called using GenotypeGVCFs (-G StandardAnnotation). SNPs and INDELs were extracted and filtered out separately using SelectVariants.

This vcf file was further filtered by removing missing data using the option\u2013max-missing 1, filtering out sites with a coverage below 5th or above the 95th coverage sample percentile using the options\u2013min-meanDP and\u2013max-meanDP, and minimum site quality of 30 (\u2014minQ 30) in vcftools 0.1.16 . Sites with a mappability less than 1 calculated by GenMap 1.3.0  were filtered using bedtools 2.18 . As an additional filtering step, the ancestral and evolved vcf files were intersected using BCFtools 1.3.1  and variants with shared positions were extracted from the vcf files of the evolved hybrids. Annotation and effect prediction of the variants were performed with SnpEff .", "We used sppIDer  to assess the proportional genomic contribution of each species to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in each sequenced hybrid. In addition, we used the tool to identify potential aneuploidies within these genomes. CNVs were called using CNVkit (\u2014method wgs,\u2014-target-avg-size 1000) . As the analysis was performed on a haploid reference (both parental genomes were present), a CNV of log2 = 1 corresponds to a duplication.", "Since S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus show divergence greater than 20% we could not detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by mapping to a single parental reference. As both hybrids appear to have one copy of each parental genome with no aneuploidies, LOH should appear as a loss of coverage segments that can be detected as copy number losses. LOH regions were detected by mapping reads to the concatenated genome and we used CNVkit  to detect genomic segments (1000 bp windows) showing CNVs with log2FC less than -2. Comparisons were made between parental strains vs ancestral hybrids and between ancestral hybrids with evolved hybrids.\nRNA-seq analysis", "Gene expression analysis was performed on ancestral and evolved hybrid strains H3-A and H3-E.

Reads were mapped to a concatenated fasta file of the DBVPG6765 and CL216.1 genome sequences. To account for mapping bias due to the different genetic distances of the parental strains to their reference strains, the L3 and CL710.1 parental strains were re-sequenced using WGS, after which genomic reads were mapped with BWA  to the DBVPG6765 and CL216 references and SNPs were called using freebayes . These SNPs were used to correct the hybrid genome sequence using the GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool. RNAseq reads were mapped to this hybrid reference using STAR (-outSAMmultNmax 1, -outMultimapperOrder random) . Counts were obtained with featureCounts using a concatenated annotation file . Counts were further analyzed in R using de DESeq package ", ". A PCA analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of replicates was performed, after which two outlier replicates (H3-A replicate 3 and H3-E replicate 2) were removed. To analyze differences in allele expression, a list of 1-to-1 orthologous genes between both parental strains was identified using OMA . Orthologous genes that differ more than 5% on their gene lengths were excluded. The differential allelic expression of these orthologous genes was determined using design = ~parental, with parental being \u201cL3\u201d or \u201cCL710\u201d. Furthermore, orthologous genes that showed differential allele expression depending on the ancestral or evolved strain background were assessed using an interaction term (~ parental:condition), with condition being \u201cancestral\u201d or \u201cevolved\u201d.

Briefly, the gRNAs were designed using the Benchling online tool (https://www.benchling.com/) and cloned into the pAEF5 plasmid , using standard \u201cGolden Gate Assembly\u201d . Ancestral and evolved hybrids were co-transformed with the pAEF5 plasmid carrying the gRNA and the Cas9 gene, together with a double-stranded DNA fragment (donor DNA).

Initially, three S. cerevisiae strains from vineyards were selected because they showed: i) the highest maximum CO2 loss in beer wort (S2A Fig and S2 Table), ii) the best growth performance under maltotriose conditions (S2B Fig), and iii) the most efficient maltotriose uptake during microculture conditions (S2C Fig). These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively.

While some hybrids exhibited positive mid-parent heterosis in 5 out 7 conditions (Tab C in S3 Table), we generally did not observe hybrids with positive best-parent heterosis (BPH, Tab D in S3 Table), except for rare cases involving maltose utilization and growth rate during diauxic shift, where 2 and 5 hybrids, respectively, displayed positive values (Fig 1C). Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA). We did not observe any hybrids exhibiting superior fermentative capacity when compared to their respective parental strains (S3 Fig), and there was no evidence for hybrid vigour according to best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients (Fig 1E and Tabs C and D in S4 Table). Neither parents nor hybrids reached the fermentative capacity of the commercial strain W34/70 (p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA).\nEvolved lines carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria exhibit a greater fitness under fermentation", "All results so far indicated that the de novo interspecific hybrids did not show any hybrid vigour, in none of the phenotypes assessed. We thus decided to subject hybrids to experimental evolution to enhance their fermentative capacity. We specifically selected four hybrids (H3.12\u20133, H4.12\u20134, H6.20\u20132, and H8.20\u20135) because they demonstrated the highest phenotypic values across kinetic parameters. From here on we will refer to these strains as H3-A, H4-A, H6-A, and H8-A (A for \u2018ancestral\u2019 or unevolved hybrid). These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ". To enhance the fermentative capacity of these selected hybrids, they were subjected to adaptive evolution at 20\u00b0C for 250 generations under two distinct conditions: i) YNB supplemented with 2% maltose and 9% ethanol (referred to as \"M\" medium), and ii) YNB supplemented with 1% maltose, 1% maltotriose, and 9% ethanol (referred to as \u201cT\u201d medium). We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig). All evolved lines significantly increased in fitness in at least one of the evolution media and/or kinetic parameters assessed compared to their respective ancestral hybrids (Fig 2A and Tabs A and B in S5 Table; p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, evolved lines from hybrids made at 12\u00b0C mating temperature (H3-A and H4-A) showed a more pronounced fitness increase in the T medium compared to those generated at 20\u00b0C (p-value = 3.327e-08, one-way ANOVA, Figs 2B and S4B), suggesting that hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria have greater potential for improvement than hybrids with S. cerevisiae mitochondria.

We did not observe a significant increase in CO2 production levels in the evolved lines of the H6-A and H8-A hybrids in either M or T media (Figs 2C and S6 and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively). Thus, both evolved hybrid lines generated at cold-temperature, carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria, showed a greater increase in CO2 production than hybrids carrying the S", ". cerevisiae mitochondria (Fig 2C). Specifically, hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria increased their maximum CO2 loss by 10.6% when evolving in M medium (p-value = 0.003698, one-way ANOVA) and by 13% in T medium (p-value = 1.328e-08, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2D). This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain. Interestingly, two genotypes deriving from H6-A (carrying the S. cerevisiae mitochondria) evolved in T medium also showed a CO2 loss similar to the commercial strain (p-value = 0.90372, one-way ANOVA).", "To focus more in-depth on the evolved lines with the highest fermentative capacity and carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria (H3-4 and H4-1 evolved in T medium, S7 Fig), we isolated three colonies from each of these two lines to evaluate their fermentative capabilities. Notably, the CO2 loss kinetics among these genotypes were comparable (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA), with genotype #1 from line H3-4 exhibiting the highest CO2 loss (Fig 3A). All these genotypes\u2019 fermentation profiles closely resembled that of the W34/70 commercial lager strain, underscoring the significantly high fermentative capacity of these novel hybrids (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig 3A). All genotypes consumed the maltotriose in the T medium completely (Tab A in S7 Table), and ethanol production ranged from 3.50% to 3.78% v/v (Fig 3B), which is similar to the commercial strain (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA).

This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "To identify mutations in evolved hybrids associated with their improved fermentative capacity, we sequenced the genomes of the two genotypes exhibiting the highest CO2 production levels, specifically H3-4-C1 and H4-1-C1 (from here on referred to as H3-E and H4-E; with \u2018E\u2019 for evolved hybrid) that were evolved in the maltose/maltotriose T medium (Tab A in S8 Table). Genome sequencing revealed that these two strain backgrounds had equal contributions from both parental genomes and that they had euploid, diploid genomes with no detectable aneuploidies (Tab B in S8 Table), containing the S. eubayanus mitochondria. We only detected small LOH regions that were associated with the hybridization process, mainly losses of S. eubayanus DNA at subtelomeric regions (Tab C in S8 Table) but also a small LOH region partly spanning the HKR1 gene located in chromosome II, between the H4-A hybrid compared with the CL216.1 parent (Tab C in S8 Table).", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". While in H4-E, we identified a missense mutation in MDS3 (a putative component of the TOR regulatory pathway), FSF1 (predicted to be an alpha-isopropyl malate carrier), and ASC1 (core component of the small ribosomal subunit) in the S. eubayanus subgenome, and an upstream gene mutation in SSK2 (MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG signalling pathway) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table).", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7.

We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.

One evolutionary mechanism to overcome harsh conditions is hybridization, because it rapidly combines beneficial phenotypic features of distantly related species and generates large amounts of genetic variation available for natural selection to act on [3\u20135]. Hybrids can also express unique phenotypic traits not seen in the parental populations through the recombination of parental genetic material, enabling them to thrive in different ecological niches [4,6\u20138]. An iconic example is the domesticated hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus to produce modern lager (pilsner) beers. S", ". pastorianus results from the successful interspecies hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus . Hybrids have been shown to benefit from the cold tolerance of S. eubayanus and the superior fermentation kinetics of S. cerevisiae . We now know that domestication over the last 500 years has generated lager yeast strains with the unique ability to rapidly ferment at lower temperatures resulting in a crisp flavour profile and efficient sedimentation, improving the clarity of the final product. However, the genetic diversity of commercial lager yeast strains is extremely limited, mainly due to the standardization of industrial lager production during the nineteenth century in Germany . This gave rise to only two genetically distinct S. pastorianus subgroups, Group 1 strains (\u2018Saaz\u2019) and Group 2 strains (\u2018Frohberg\u2019)", ". The poor genetic diversity of lager strains used in commercial brewing today (85 lager strains commercially available versus 358 ale strains ) puts tight constraints on the variety of flavours and aromas found in lager beer. At the same time, it limits our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism operating during the yeast domestication process.", "The discovery of S. eubayanus in Patagonia in 2011 , opened new possibilities for creating novel hybrid strains by using the full range of natural genetic diversity found in this species. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed six distinct lineages of S. eubayanus, including China, Patagonia A (\u2018PA\u2019), Holarctic, and Patagonia B, \u2018PB-1\u2019, \u2018PB-2\u2019 and \u2018PB-3\u2019, and some admixed strains derived from ancient crosses . Of these, S. eubayanus from Patagonia displays the broadest phenotypic diversity for a wide range of traits, including high maltose consumption, aroma profiles, and fermentation capacity . The distinctive traits of wild Patagonian S. eubayanus strains indicate their potential for crafting new lager beer styles. These strains could yield novel taste and aroma profiles, approaching similar complexity and diversity in flavour, appearance, and mouthfeel as Ale beers.", "Lager yeast hybrids experienced an intense domestication process through selection and re-pitching during beer fermentation since the 17th century , a process similar to experimental evolution . Experimental evolution with microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptive responses to selection under environmental constraints [23\u201326]. Recent studies on novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids suggest that hybrid fermentative vigour at low temperature results from a variety of genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), ectopic recombination, transcriptional rewiring, selection of superior parental alleles , heterozygote advantage due to the complementation of loss-of-function mutations in the F1 hybrid genome , and novel structural and single nucleotide variants in the hybrid genome ", ". A recent transcriptome analysis of a laboratory-made lager hybrid strain under fermentation conditions highlighted that the regulatory \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between the parental subgenomes caused a novel sugar consumption phenotype in the hybrid (maltotriose utilization, essential for lager fermentation), which was absent in both parental strains . Although these studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of different lager phenotypes, most studies only considered a single S. eubayanus genetic background (type strain CBS 12357), which alone is not representative of the species-rich genetic diversity.", "Here, we hybridized three different S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus strains to generate genetically and phenotypically diverse novel lager hybrids via spore-to-spore mating. The initial de novo hybrids had fermentation capacities comparable to those of their parental strains and did not show positive heterosis. However, when we subjected hybrids to a \u2018fast motion\u2019 improvement process using experimental evolution under different fermentation conditions for 250 generations, they exceeded the fitness of the ancestral hybrids, particularly those retaining the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Superior hybrid fitness was explained by faster fermentation performance and greater maltose and maltotriose consumption We found that copy number variation in MAL genes in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, together with SNPs in genes related to glycolytic flux, induced significantly greater expression levels of MAL and IMA1 genes, and led to improved fitness under fermentative conditions in these novel S", ". cerevisiae x S. eubayanus yeast hybrids. Furthermore, evolved hybrids had significantly distinct aroma profiles, varying significantly from the established profiles found in lager beer.", "Materials and methods\nParental strains\nThree S. cerevisiae strains were selected for hybridization from a collection of 15 strains isolated from different wine-producing areas in Central Chile and previously described by Martinez et al. . Similarly, three S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a collection of strains isolated from different locations in Chilean Patagonia, exhibiting high fermentative capacity and representative of the different Patagonia-B lineages (PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3) . The S. pastorianus Saflager W34/70 (Fermentis, France) strain was used as a commercial lager fermentation control. All strains were maintained in YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. Strains are listed in Tab A in S1 Table.\nInterspecific hybrids strains and mitochondria genotyping", "Parental strains were sporulated on 2% potassium acetate agar plates (2% agar) for at least seven days at 20\u00b0C. Interspecific F1 hybrids were generated through spore-spore mating between S. eubayanus strains and S. cerevisiae strains (S1 Fig). For this, tetrads were treated with 10 \u03bcL Zymolyase 100 T (50 mg/mL) and spores of opposite species were dissected and placed next to each other on a YPD agar plates using a SporePlay micromanipulator (Singer Instruments, UK). Plates were incubated at two different temperatures, 12 and 20\u00b0C, for 2\u20135 days to preserve the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described , resulting in nine different F1 hybrids (ranging from H1 until H9, Tab A in S1 Table). This procedure was repeated on 25 tetrads of each species, for each type of cross (H1 to H9) and temperature (12 and 20\u00b0C), resulting in 18 different cross x temperature combinations", ". Finally, colonies were isolated, re-streaked on fresh YPD agar plates, and continued to be incubated at 12 and 20\u00b0C. The hybrid status of isolated colonies was confirmed by amplification of rDNA-PCR (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) using universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 , followed by digestion of the amplicon using the HaeIII restriction enzyme (Promega, USA) as previously described  on one colony for each cross attempt (S1 Fig). Confirmed F1 hybrids were designated as H1 to H9 based on parental strains, followed by the hybridization temperature (12 or 20) and the colony number (i.e. H1.20\u20131 depicts cross 1 at 20\u00b0C (Tab A in S1 Table)). We identified the mitochondrial genotype by Sanger sequencing the mitochondrial COX3 gene as previously described .", "Beer wort fermentation and metabolite screening\nFermentations were carried out in three biological replicates using previously oxygenated (15 mg/L) 12\u00b0P wort, supplemented with 0.3 ppm ZnCl2 as previously described . Briefly, pre-cultures were grown in 5 mL 6\u00b0P wort for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were then transferred to 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort and incubated for 24 h at 20\u00b0C with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and used to calculate the final cell concentration to inoculate the subsequent fermentation according to the formula described by White and Zainasheff . Cells were inoculated into 50 mL 12\u00b0P wort in 250 mL bottles covered by airlocks containing 30% glycerol. The fermentations were incubated at 12 or 20\u00b0C, with no agitation for 15 days and monitored by weighing the bottles daily to determine weight loss over time.", "Sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) consumption and ethanol production were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) after 14 days of fermentation. Filtered samples (20 \u03bcL) were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a BioRad HPX-87H column using 5 mM sulfuric acid and 4 mL acetonitrile per liter of sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. Volatile compound production was determined by using HeadSpace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) after 14 days of fermentation as previously described .\nPhenotypic characterization", "Hybrids and parental strains were phenotypically characterized under microculture conditions as previously described . Briefly, we estimated mitotic growth in 96-well plates containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) supplemented with 2% glucose, 2% maltose, 2% maltotriose, 2% glucose and 9% ethanol, 2% glucose and 10% sorbitol, and under carbon source switching (diauxic shift) from glucose to maltose as previously described . All conditions were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Lag phase, growth efficiency, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) were determined as previously described . For the diauxic shift between glucose and maltose, lag time and \u03bcmax were determined during growth in maltose. The parameters were calculated following curve fitting (OD values were transformed to ln) using the Gompertz function  in R (version 4.03).", "Mid-parent and best-parent heterosis were determined as previously described , using Eq 1 and 2, where mid-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the mid-parent performance and best-parent heterosis denotes the hybrid deviation from the better parent phenotypic value .\n(1)(2)Experimental evolution", "Experimental evolution was carried out at 20\u00b0C under two different media conditions (M and T): 1) YNB + 2% maltose supplemented with 9% ethanol (M) and 2) YNB + 1% maltose + 1% maltotriose supplemented with 9% ethanol (T). Experimental evolution assays in maltose were performed in a final volume of 1 mL in 2 mL tubes, while those in maltose and maltotriose were performed in a 96-well plate under a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Each hybrid strain was first grown in 0.67% YNB medium with 2% maltose at 25\u00b0C for 24 h with constant agitation at 150 rpm. Each pre-inoculum was then used to inoculate each evolution line at an initial OD600nm of 0.1, with three replicate lines per strain in medium M and four replicate lines in medium T. Lines in medium M were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 72 h. Lines in medium T were incubated for 144 h at 20\u00b0C. After this, cultures were then serially transferred into fresh medium for an initial OD600nm of 0.1", ". Serial transfers were repeated for 250 generations in total (approximately seven months). The number of generations was determined using the formula log(final cells\u2013initial cells)/log2 . Population samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks after 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 generations. After 250 generations, three colonies were isolated for each replicate line on YPM solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% maltose and 2% agar) supplemented with 6% ethanol. The fastest growing colonies were stored at -80\u00b0C in 20% glycerol stocks. The fitness increase of each the 28 evolved line was determined as the ratio between the phenotypic value of a given line and the equivalent of its respective ancestral hybrid.", "Genomic characterization", "Genomic DNA was obtained for whole-genome sequencing using the YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research, USA) and sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq500 following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Variant calling and filtering were done with GATK version 4.3.0.0 . Briefly, cleaned reads were mapped to a concatenated reference genome consisting of S. cerevisiae strain DBVPG6765  and S. eubayanus strain CL216.1  using BWA mem 0.7.17 , after which output bam files were sorted and indexed using Samtools 1.13 . Variants were called per sample using HaplotypeCaller (default settings) generating g.vcf files. Variant databases were built using GenomicsDBImport and genotypes were called using GenotypeGVCFs (-G StandardAnnotation). SNPs and INDELs were extracted and filtered out separately using SelectVariants. We then applied recommended filters with the following options: QD < 2.0, FS > 60.0, MQ < 40.0, SOR > 4.0, MQRankSum < -12.5, ReadPosRankSum < -8.0", ". This vcf file was further filtered by removing missing data using the option\u2013max-missing 1, filtering out sites with a coverage below 5th or above the 95th coverage sample percentile using the options\u2013min-meanDP and\u2013max-meanDP, and minimum site quality of 30 (\u2014minQ 30) in vcftools 0.1.16 . Sites with a mappability less than 1 calculated by GenMap 1.3.0  were filtered using bedtools 2.18 . As an additional filtering step, the ancestral and evolved vcf files were intersected using BCFtools 1.3.1  and variants with shared positions were extracted from the vcf files of the evolved hybrids. Annotation and effect prediction of the variants were performed with SnpEff .", "We used sppIDer  to assess the proportional genomic contribution of each species to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in each sequenced hybrid. In addition, we used the tool to identify potential aneuploidies within these genomes. CNVs were called using CNVkit (\u2014method wgs,\u2014-target-avg-size 1000) . As the analysis was performed on a haploid reference (both parental genomes were present), a CNV of log2 = 1 corresponds to a duplication.", "Since S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus show divergence greater than 20% we could not detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by mapping to a single parental reference. As both hybrids appear to have one copy of each parental genome with no aneuploidies, LOH should appear as a loss of coverage segments that can be detected as copy number losses. LOH regions were detected by mapping reads to the concatenated genome and we used CNVkit  to detect genomic segments (1000 bp windows) showing CNVs with log2FC less than -2. Comparisons were made between parental strains vs ancestral hybrids and between ancestral hybrids with evolved hybrids.\nRNA-seq analysis", "Gene expression analysis was performed on ancestral and evolved hybrid strains H3-A and H3-E. RNA was obtained and processed after 24 h under beer wort fermentation in triplicates, using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA kit I (OMEGA) as previously described .

Illumina sequencing was performed in NextSeq500 platform.", "Reads quality was evaluated using the fastqc tool (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and processed using fastp (-3 l 40) . Reads were mapped to a concatenated fasta file of the DBVPG6765 and CL216.1 genome sequences. To account for mapping bias due to the different genetic distances of the parental strains to their reference strains, the L3 and CL710.1 parental strains were re-sequenced using WGS, after which genomic reads were mapped with BWA  to the DBVPG6765 and CL216 references and SNPs were called using freebayes . These SNPs were used to correct the hybrid genome sequence using the GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool. RNAseq reads were mapped to this hybrid reference using STAR (-outSAMmultNmax 1, -outMultimapperOrder random) . Counts were obtained with featureCounts using a concatenated annotation file . Counts were further analyzed in R using de DESeq package ", ". A PCA analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of replicates was performed, after which two outlier replicates (H3-A replicate 3 and H3-E replicate 2) were removed. To analyze differences in allele expression, a list of 1-to-1 orthologous genes between both parental strains was identified using OMA . Orthologous genes that differ more than 5% on their gene lengths were excluded. The differential allelic expression of these orthologous genes was determined using design = ~parental, with parental being \u201cL3\u201d or \u201cCL710\u201d. Furthermore, orthologous genes that showed differential allele expression depending on the ancestral or evolved strain background were assessed using an interaction term (~ parental:condition), with condition being \u201cancestral\u201d or \u201cevolved\u201d. Finally, to evaluate differences between ancestral and evolved hybrid strains, all 11,047 hybrid genes (5,508 S. eubayanus and 5,539 S. cerevisiae) were individually tested for differential expression using DESeq2", ". Overall gene expression differences were evaluated using the design ~condition. For all analyzes an FDR < 0.05 was used to consider statistical differences. GO term enrichment analyzes on differentially expressed genes were calculated using the package TOPGO .", "IRA2 gene validation", "The S. cerevisiae IRA2 polymorphism was validated by Sanger sequencing. PCR products were purified and sequenced by KIGene, Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). The presence of the SNP in the evolved hybrid strains was checked by visual inspection of the electropherograms. Null mutants for the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome were generated using CRISPR-Cas9  as previously described . Briefly, the gRNAs were designed using the Benchling online tool (https://www.benchling.com/) and cloned into the pAEF5 plasmid , using standard \u201cGolden Gate Assembly\u201d . Ancestral and evolved hybrids were co-transformed with the pAEF5 plasmid carrying the gRNA and the Cas9 gene, together with a double-stranded DNA fragment (donor DNA). The donor DNA contained nourseothricin (NAT) resistance cassette, obtained from the pAG25 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #35121), flanked with sequences of the target allele, corresponding to 50-pb upstream of start codon and 50-pb downstream of the stop codon", ".

Initially, cells were recovered from glycerol stocks on YPD solid media and allowed to grow overnight at 25\u00b0C. Subsequently, a portion of each patch was transferred into liquid YPD media and incubated overnight at 25\u00b0C. Then, 1 ml of each culture was harvested and suspended in 2.3 ml of cold 70% ethanol for fixation during 48h h at 4\u00b0C. Following fixation, cells were washed with sodium citrate (50 mM, pH 7) and 100 \u03bcl of cells resuspended in the same solution, and 1 \u03bcL of RNAse A (100 mg/mL) were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with a solution containing PI (final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL) and sodium citrate (50 mM, pH 7), and incubated for 40 min at room temperature in darkness.

Maximum specific growth rates and total CO2 loss were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences between the mean values of three replicates were tested using Student\u2019s t-test and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A p-value less than 0.05 (p<0.05) was considered statistically significant. Heatmaps were generated using the ComplexHeatmap package version 2.6.2. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on phenotypic data using the FactoMineR package version 2.4 and the factoextra package version 1.07 for extracting, visualizing and interpreting the results.\nResults\nDe novo S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus F1 hybrids show similar phenotypes as their parental strains", "The S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental strains were selected from a previously described collection of Chilean isolates by Martinez et al.  and Nespolo, Villarroel et al. , respectively (Tab A in S1 Table). Initially, three S. cerevisiae strains from vineyards were selected because they showed: i) the highest maximum CO2 loss in beer wort (S2A Fig and S2 Table), ii) the best growth performance under maltotriose conditions (S2B Fig), and iii) the most efficient maltotriose uptake during microculture conditions (S2C Fig). These strains were L3, L270, and L348. The selection of S. eubayanus parental strains was determined by two criteria: i) to represent distinct lineages found in the Chilean Patagonia to maximize genetic diversity (one strain per lineage, PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3), and ii) to display the highest CO2 loss during fermentation when compared to strains within their respective lineages based on previous assays . In this way, we selected CL450.1, CL710", ".1 and CL216.1, from PB-1, PB-2, and PB-3, respectively. All strains were able to sporulate (Tab C in S2 Table).", "Nine interspecific F1 hybrid crosses were performed through spore-to-spore mating at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, to promote the preservation of the cold- and heat-tolerant mitochondria, respectively, as previously described (S1 Fig) . We obtained 31 interspecific hybrids (Tab A in S1 Table), which we phenotyped individually under microculture conditions resembling those encountered during beer wort fermentation, such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and in the presence of ethanol and simulating osmotic stress with sorbitol (S3 Table). Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic data denotes three main clusters, where there was no discernible clustering of hybrids based on their parental strains or hybridization temperature, highlighting the considerable phenotypic diversity resulting from hybridization (Fig 1A). To describe the phenotypic landscape of the 31 hybrids more comprehensively, we conducted a PCA analysis (Fig 1B)", ". The individual factor map shows that hybrids made at 20\u00b0C fall into the right upper quarter of the phenotype space, and are associated with a higher growth rate in media with maltose and glucose compared to hybrids made at 12\u00b0C. This was particularly the case for four hybrid strains (H1, H3, H4 and H6), involving parental strains L3, L270, CL216.1 and CL710.1 (all p-values < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S3 Table).", "A) Hierarchically clustered heatmap of phenotypic diversity of 31 interspecific hybrid strains under microculture conditions.

Overall, inter-species hybridization did not result in a significant enhancement of fitness in F1 hybrids.", "Next, we assessed the fermentation capacity of the 31 hybrids in wort at low temperature (Fig 1D and S4 Table). Hybrids generated at 12\u00b0C displayed similar levels of CO2 production compared to those obtained at 20\u00b0C (Fig 1D and Tab A in S4 Table, p-value = 0.17, one-way ANOVA). We did not observe any hybrids exhibiting superior fermentative capacity when compared to their respective parental strains (S3 Fig), and there was no evidence for hybrid vigour according to best-parent and mid-parent heterosis coefficients (Fig 1E and Tabs C and D in S4 Table).

From here on we will refer to these strains as H3-A, H4-A, H6-A, and H8-A (A for \u2018ancestral\u2019 or unevolved hybrid). These four hybrids completely consumed the sugars present in the beer wort, except for maltotriose, which may explain the lower fermentative capacity of the hybrids compared to the commercial strain W34/70 (Tab E in S4 Table). Furthermore, these four hybrids represent crosses made at 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and they encompass all six parental genetic backgrounds", ".

We evolved three lines independently per cross in medium M, and four independent lines per cross in medium T. These conditions were chosen because maltose is the main sugar in beer wort (approximately 60%) . Considering that yeast typically consume carbon sources in a specific order (glucose, fructose, maltose, and maltotriose), we employed a combination of maltose and maltotriose to facilitate the utilization of the latter carbon source.", "After 250 generations, the evolved lines showed different levels of fitness improvements, depending on the environmental conditions and their genetic background (Figs 2A and S4), with distinct fitness trajectories over time (S5 Fig).

However, we found a significant greater CO2 production in the evolved lines of H4-A, evident in both evolution media, indicative of higher fermentation activity. The evolved lines of H3-A under T media also demonstrated a slightly higher CO2 production (Fig 2C and Tab B in S6 Table, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, for H4 evolved lines and p-values of 0.0708 and 0.05149 for H3 evolved lines in M and T, respectively). Thus, both evolved hybrid lines generated at cold-temperature, carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria, showed a greater increase in CO2 production than hybrids carrying the S", ". cerevisiae mitochondria (Fig 2C). Specifically, hybrids with S. eubayanus mitochondria increased their maximum CO2 loss by 10.6% when evolving in M medium (p-value = 0.003698, one-way ANOVA) and by 13% in T medium (p-value = 1.328e-08, one-way ANOVA) (Fig 2D). This was predominantly due to an elevated maltotriose uptake (Fig 2E and Tab C in S6 Table). Notably, the fermentative capacity of these hybrids reached that of the commercial strain (Tab D in S6 Table, p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). These findings strongly suggest that lines derived from hybrids generated at colder temperatures carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in a complex maltose/maltotriose medium (T), significantly enhanced their lager fermentative capacity due to an increased maltotriose uptake during beer wort fermentation.", "Isolation of evolved genotypes with improved fermentative capacity and maltotriose uptake", "To isolate individual representatives from the evolved population lines, we obtained one single genotype from each of the four hybrid lines at 250 generations (28 genotypes in total), which were then subjected to phenotypic evaluation in beer wort. These individual genotypes showed similar fermentation profiles as the population-level analyses above (Fig 2F). Evolved hybrid genotypes carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria and evolved in T medium (maltose/maltotriose, H3-E and H4-E), showed higher CO2 production compared to H6-E and H8-E (p-value < 0.05, ANOVA, S7 Fig). The genotypes with the largest significant fitness increase were derived from lines H3-3 and H3-4 evolved in T conditions (S7 Fig), which exceeded the commercial strain. Interestingly, two genotypes deriving from H6-A (carrying the S. cerevisiae mitochondria) evolved in T medium also showed a CO2 loss similar to the commercial strain (p-value = 0.90372, one-way ANOVA).", "To focus more in-depth on the evolved lines with the highest fermentative capacity and carrying the S. eubayanus mitochondria (H3-4 and H4-1 evolved in T medium, S7 Fig), we isolated three colonies from each of these two lines to evaluate their fermentative capabilities. Notably, the CO2 loss kinetics among these genotypes were comparable (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA), with genotype #1 from line H3-4 exhibiting the highest CO2 loss (Fig 3A). All these genotypes\u2019 fermentation profiles closely resembled that of the W34/70 commercial lager strain, underscoring the significantly high fermentative capacity of these novel hybrids (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig 3A). All genotypes consumed the maltotriose in the T medium completely (Tab A in S7 Table), and ethanol production ranged from 3.50% to 3.78% v/v (Fig 3B), which is similar to the commercial strain (p-value > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). One genotype (H4-1-C3) showed a remarkable 7", ".1% increase in ethanol production compared to the commercial strain (Fig 3B, p-value = 0.001, one-way ANOVA).", "(A) Maximum CO2 loss (g/L) for three different isolated genotypes (C1-C3) from evolved lines H3-4 and H4-1, ancestral hybrids (H3-A and H4-A) and commercial lager strain (W34/70).

This assay allowed us to identify 15 and 14 compounds in the evolved and commercial lager strains, respectively. We observed significant differences for 11 different compounds (Fig 3C, p-value < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Tab B in S7 Table), including ethyl esters and higher alcohols. For example, the evolved strain produced significantly more fatty acid ethyl esters, such as dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acid ethyl esters (p-value = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively, one-way ANOVA), which could provide sweetish notes. The commercial lager strain on the other hand produced higher amounts of other fatty acid ethyl esters, such as octanoic acid and nonanoic acid (Fig 3D, p-value = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA), and citronellol (p-value < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA), which is associated with a citrus aroma", ". The H3-4-C1evolved hybrid produced detectable levels of 4-vinphenol, associated with clove-like, spicy, and phenolic aromas, commonly found in Belgian ale and wheat beers, which was completely absent in the lager strain. These results demonstrate that the aroma profiles of the evolved hybrid differ from the commercial lager strain. Therefore, the beers produced with the evolved hybrid would have a different profile towards a more herbal, spicy, and phenolic character. In contrast, those produced with the commercial strain would have a more citrusy and refreshing profile.", "Mutation in IRA2 affects fermentation capacity in the evolved hybrid", "To identify mutations in evolved hybrids associated with their improved fermentative capacity, we sequenced the genomes of the two genotypes exhibiting the highest CO2 production levels, specifically H3-4-C1 and H4-1-C1 (from here on referred to as H3-E and H4-E; with \u2018E\u2019 for evolved hybrid) that were evolved in the maltose/maltotriose T medium (Tab A in S8 Table). Genome sequencing revealed that these two strain backgrounds had equal contributions from both parental genomes and that they had euploid, diploid genomes with no detectable aneuploidies (Tab B in S8 Table), containing the S. eubayanus mitochondria. We only detected small LOH regions that were associated with the hybridization process, mainly losses of S. eubayanus DNA at subtelomeric regions (Tab C in S8 Table) but also a small LOH region partly spanning the HKR1 gene located in chromosome II, between the H4-A hybrid compared with the CL216.1 parent (Tab C in S8 Table).", "We then identified de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the evolved hybrid genomes that were absent in the ancestral hybrids. We found 3 and 4 SNPs in the H3-E and H4-E backgrounds, respectively (Tab D in S8 Table). The evolved hybrids presented a similar number of SNPs per genome. In H3-E, we found 1 and 2 SNPs in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental genomes, respectively, while H4-E had 1 and 3 SNPs in the corresponding parental genomes. We identified an anticipated stop-codon in the IRA2 allele (encoding for a GTPase-activating protein, Fig 4A) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, and a missense mutation in CKB2 (encoding for a subunit of casein kinase 2) and CMC1 (encoding for a mitochondrial protein necessary for full assembly of Cytochrome c oxidase) in the S. eubayanus subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table) in H3-E", ". While in H4-E, we identified a missense mutation in MDS3 (a putative component of the TOR regulatory pathway), FSF1 (predicted to be an alpha-isopropyl malate carrier), and ASC1 (core component of the small ribosomal subunit) in the S. eubayanus subgenome, and an upstream gene mutation in SSK2 (MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG signalling pathway) in the S. cerevisiae subgenome (Tab D in S8 Table).", "(A) SNP present in the IRA2 gene in the S. cerevisiae subgenome in the H3-E hybrid.

The (*) represents different levels of significance between mutant and wild-type strains (Student t-test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001).", "To detect additional genetic changes not identified in the individual clones and to track the relative frequencies of the de novo mutations in the evolution lines, we sequenced whole population samples at increasing time points of experimental evolution (at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 generations; S8 Fig and Tabs D and E in S8 Table). In this way, we identified 1 and 2 additional variants in the H3 and H4 evolved lines, respectively. For example, in the H4-evolved lines, we identified mutations within the SCC2 and NSE1 coding regions of two genes related to DNA replication and repair processes (Tab D in S8 Table). Subsequently, we estimated the IRA2 mutation frequencies on the H3-evolved line. The IRA2-L2418* polymorphism arose before generation 50 and was completely fixed by 150 generations", ". We also determined the ploidy of this population at the end of the evolution process (250 generations), confirming that ploidy levels did not change during the experimental evolution process in the H3 population, maintaining a diploid state (S9 Fig).", "To determine the phenotypic impact of the stop-codon detected in the IRA2 gene, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting the S. cerevisiae IRA2, generating null mutants (ira2Sc) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids. We evaluated growth under microculture conditions in the same evolutionary medium (T) and under beer wort fermentation (Fig 4B). This assay revealed that ira2Sc mutants in the H3-A hybrid background had a 12.5% lower ODmax under maltose/maltotriose conditions compared to H3-A (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.01213, one-way ANOVA), but still a similar fermentative capacity (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.79685, one-way ANOVA). In the H3-E hybrid, the null ira2Sc mutant showed a 16.6% higher ODmax under microculture conditions (Fig 4B, p-value = 0.00042, one-way ANOVA) and a significantly lower fermentative capacity under beer wort, with a 13.6% decrease in CO2 production (Fig 4C, p-value = 0.02315 one-way ANOVA, S9 Table) and a 10", ".8% decrease in the maximum CO2 loss rate (S9 Table, p-value = 0.02268 one-way ANOVA). This decrease in the fermentative capacity in the H3-E null mutant correlates with a lower maltotriose uptake (68.6%, Fig 4D). These results suggest that the stop-codon in IRA2 in the evolved hybrids does not necessarily lead to a loss of protein function, but instead to a complex genetic interaction in the H3-E background promoting a trade-off between biomass and fermentative capacity, which is likely partly responsible for the phenotypic differences during the evolutionary process.", "Copy number variants of genes related to maltose metabolism are associated with improved fermentative capacity in evolved hybrids\nSince ira2 null mutants did not restore the full increase in fermentative capacity of the evolved hybrids, we examined genes exhibiting copy number variation (CNVs) in H3-E and H4-E hybrids (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). Both H3-E and H4-E hybrids contained changes in copy number, particularly in the MAL gene family (Fig 5A and Tab F in S8 Table). For example, we identified 2 and 4 extra copies of the MAL13 and MAL11 genes in H4-E and H3-E, respectively.", "(A) Copy number variations (CNVs) between H3-E and H4-E hybrids relative to their ancestral hybrids found in S. cerevisiae chromosome 7.

In blue highlight transporters involved in sugar consumption.", "To determine the impact of these mutations and the CNVs in the transcriptome of the H3-E hybrid, we estimated transcript abundance under beer fermentative conditions in the evolved and non-evolved hybrid. We identified 40 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs, FDR < 5%, Tab G in S8 Table), where 21 and 19 genes were up- and down-regulated in the evolved hybrid relative to its hybrid ancestor, respectively. Interestingly, we found that S. cerevisiae alleles for IMA1, MAL11, and MAL13 were up-regulated in H3-E, which correlates with the increased gene copy number (Fig 5B). A GO term analysis showed that genes involved in maltose metabolic processes were up-regulated and genes in cell wall organization were down-regulated in the evolved hybrid (Tab H in S8 Table).", "To measure the impact of cis-variants on allelic expression within each parental subgenome, we estimated allele specific expression (ASE) in the evolved and non-evolved hybrids (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Seven genes showed ASE differences between the evolved and ancestral hybrid, likely originating from mutations in regulatory regions acquired during experimental evolution (Fig 5C and Tab I in S8 Table). Of these, one and six ASE differences in the H3-E hybrid represented up-regulated alleles in the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus subgenomes, respectively (Tab I in S8 Table). Interestingly, we detected the up-regulation of the REG2 allele related to sugar consumption with a 2.1 higher fold change in the S. cerevisiae subgenome, which is involved in the regulation of glucose-repressible genes (Fig 5C), correlating with the higher maltose and maltotriose consumption levels in the evolved hybrid.\nDiscussion", "The hybrid yeast strains traditionally used for lager beer production (S. pastorianus) are highly limited in genetic diversity. Currently, only two types of strains are used worldwide , stemming from a single hybridization event that gave rise to the current lager strains. This strongly constrains the diversity of available flavour and aroma profiles. The genetically depleted landscape of lager strains also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes crucial for the adaptation process . The recent discovery of genetically and phenotypically distinct S. eubayanus lineages, including isolates from Patagonia [14\u201316,69], opened new avenues for developing new strains to increase the diversity of fermentation profiles . Previous studies using hybridization and experimental evolution demonstrated that lager yeast hybrids could be improved through selection under fermentation conditions  without polyploidization ", ". While these studies have expanded the diversity of lager yeast phenotypes, they are primarily based on a single S. eubayanus genetic background, CBS 12357T (belonging to PB-1), which is not representative of the overall species\u2019 genetic and phenotypic diversity . S. eubayanus lineages vary widely in fermentation capacity and aroma profiles during beer fermentation, suggesting that the natural diversity of S. eubayanus is also well-suited for making innovative lager hybrid strains . Here, we expanded the strain repertoire available for lager brewing by including all three different S. eubayanus lineages found in Patagonia. Leveraging the genetic diversity of S. eubayanus, we created novel S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids and enhanced their fermentation capacity through experimental evolution", ". Interestingly, no polyploidies, aneuploidies, or loss of heterozygosity events were detected in our evolved hybrids, suggesting that these structural chromosomal changes might not be essential for efficient fermentation performance. Instead, we show that desirable phenotypic outcomes such as high ethanol production and new aroma profiles are the result of an intricate interplay of pre-existing genetic diversity, and selection on species-specific mitochondria, de novo mutations and differential expression in sugar consumption genes, together with CNV of the MAL genes, important to improve maltose consumption during fermentation.", "Hybridization offers a mechanism to combine beneficial traits from different species, which can enable adaptation to new environmental conditions  and improve the yield of plant cultivars and animal breeds . However, hybridization\u2014without subsequent selection of desirable traits for multiple generations\u2014may not be sufficient to generate new phenotypes. None of the initial F1 hybrids in our experiment showed best parent heterosis, demonstrating that hybridization at different temperatures alone, was not sufficient to generate hybrids with a greater fitness than their parents under fermentative conditions. We therefore turned to experimental evolution as an alternative approach to improve the hybrids\u2019 fermentative profiles. Experimental evolution across multiple generations, paired with time-series whole genome sequencing, is a powerful tool for studying microbial responses to a selective environment and understanding the fitness effects of de novo mutations [24\u201326,77]", ". We found that, after 250 generations in a high sugar and ethanol environment, hybrids evolved faster fermentation performance and higher ethanol production compared to both parents and ancestral unevolved hybrids. We also identified an evolved individual that produces significantly more ethanol than the commercial lager strain, likely due to differences in metabolic fluxes between them. For example, in the production of glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid, as well as in the consumption of more complex sugar sources. An alternative is to obtain improved strains by performing experimental evolution on parental strains, as previously described . However, S. eubayanus has poor maltotriose consumption, a trait not easily improvable through artificial selection compared to commercial strains . Instead, hybridization has the potential to produce more genetic variation than mutations alone", ". Thus, the hybrids combine traits of both parents, such as low-temperature tolerance and maltotriose uptake. In addition, the gene expression subgenomes crosstalk may generate different volatile compound combinations, increasing the variety of flavors and aromas . Interestingly, the hybrids\u2019 evolutionary potential relied on the parental mitochondria. Our study shows that carrying mitochondria from S. eubayanus provides a selective advantage under fermentation conditions and leads to greater evolutionary potential in hybrids. Consistent with our results, all lager commercial hybrids have S. eubayanus mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that in synthetic hybrids, S. eubayanus mitochondria confers vigorous growth at colder temperatures compared to the S. cerevisiae mitotype, potentially conferring a competitive advantage in the cooler brewing conditions typical of lagers . However, we performed experimental evolution at warmer temperatures (25\u00b0C)", ". It is thus plausible that species-specific mitochondrial effects play an additional role, specifically concerning sugar utilization and glucose repression  when adapting to lager brewing conditions. These mitochondrial effects likely involve complex genetic interactions with the nuclear genome and might be exacerbated in the presence of the S. eubayanus mitochondria.", "Our genome-wide screens for mutations to elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid fitness improvement identified de novo SNPs and CNVs in the genomes of the evolved lines and hybrids. These genetic changes were identified in genes with known effects on DNA replication and repair processes, maltose metabolism, and cell wall organization (Fig 5D). Particularly interesting is the mutation in IRA2 in the S. cerevisiae subgenome which is related to carbon metabolism. Evolved hybrids carried a premature stop codon in the IRA2 gene, absent in both the S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus parental ancestors, and in the unevolved hybrids at the beginning of experimental evolution. Despite using different experimental conditions and hybrid genetic backgrounds, previous studies have also identified mutations in the IRA2 gene in multiple evolved isolates, corroborating the important role of this gene in the fermentation process ", ". Null ira2SC mutants did not show the same phenotypes as the H3-E hybrid carrying the IRA2 premature stop codon, suggesting a complex genetic interaction in this genetic background. We searched for genes with de novo mutations previously described to have genetic interactions with IRA2 using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Our search resulted in three genes potentially interacting with IRA2: IMA1, MAL11, and CMC1. CMC1 encodes for a protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria  and contains a SNP in the corresponding S. eubayanus parental allele. In addition, IMA1 and MAL11 genes were up-regulated in the evolved hybrid and exhibited CNVs relative to the ancestral hybrid. Interactions between the S. cerevisiae IRA2 allele with these genes could explain the differences observed between the ira2SC mutants and the H3-E hybrid", ". IRA2 is required for reducing cAMP levels under nutrient limited conditions, where cAMP directly regulates the activity of several key enzymes of glycolysis . A mutation in IRA2 would increase the carbon flux through glycolysis, which is in agreement with our finding that evolved hybrids showed higher sugar consumption. Furthermore, the regulation of the yeast mitochondrial function in response to nutritional changes can be modulated by cAMP/PKA signalling , which might be exacerbated in strains carrying S. eubayanus mitochondria. We further consolidated this mechanism by CNV and transcriptome analyses, which detected several up-regulated genes related to maltose consumption in the evolved hybrid during fermentation. Fluctuations in chromosomal location and copy number of the MAL genes are present in many industrial strains  and de novo evolved hybrids , containing six or more copies of the MAL3 locus", ". Furthermore, the newly generated hybrids exhibited a distinct volatile compound profile compared to the W34/70 lager strain. This highlights the potential of wild Patagonian yeast to introduce diversity into the current repertoire of available lager yeasts. Previous studies in laboratory-made lager hybrids revealed genetic changes that significantly impacted fermentation performance and changed the aroma profile of the resulting beer, compared to the commercial lager strain .", "In summary, our study expands the genetic diversity of lager hybrids and shows that new S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids can be generated from wild yeast strains isolated from Patagonia. We found that hybridization at low temperatures, selecting for the retention of S. eubayanus mitochondria, followed by experimental evolution under fermentative conditions, and selection on desirable traits (ethanol production and aroma profiles), can generate hybrid strains with enhanced fermentation capacities. We delineate how genetic changes within distinct subgenomes of the hybrids contribute to improved fermentation efficacy, specifically in the context of cold lager brewing conditions. This opens up new opportunities for the brewing industry to alleviate current constraints in lager beer production and to expand the range of currently available lager beer styles.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Generation of interspecific S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids.", "Experimental procedure designed to generate and identify interspecific hybrids at two different temperatures (12 and 20\u00b0C).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011154.s001\n(PDF)\nS2 Fig. Phenotypic characterization of S. cerevisiae parental strains.\n(A) Fermentation performance of 15 S. cerevisiae strains.
