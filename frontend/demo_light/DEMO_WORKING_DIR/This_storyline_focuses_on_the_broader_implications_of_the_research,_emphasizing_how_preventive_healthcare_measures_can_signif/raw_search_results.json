Rates in the three states define the benchmarks. The benchmark for each cause of death is derived from a unique set of three states.\nRural and urban categories were identified using the National Center for Health Statistics 2013 urban-rural classification scheme for counties (16). County of residence of the decedent was used to determine urban-rural county classification. The categories are 1: large central metropolitan (most urban), 2: large fringe metropolitan, 3: medium metropolitan, 4: small metropolitan, 5: micropolitan, and 6: noncore (most rural).", "Public Health Action: Routine tracking of preventable premature deaths based on urban-rural county classification might enable public health departments to identify and monitor geographic disparities in health outcomes. These disparities might be related to different levels of access to health care, social determinants of health, and other risk factors. Identifying areas with a high prevalence of potentially preventable mortality might be informative for interventions.\nIntroduction", "During 2010\u20132022, preventable premature deaths from heart disease increased most in noncore (+9.5%) and micropolitan counties (+9.1%) and decreased most in large central metropolitan counties (\u221210.2%). Preventable premature deaths from cancer decreased in all county categories, with the largest decreases in large central metropolitan and large fringe metropolitan counties (\u2212100.0%; benchmark achieved in both county categories in 2019). In all county categories, preventable premature deaths from unintentional injury increased, with the largest increases occurring in large central metropolitan (+147.5%) and large fringe metropolitan (+97.5%) counties. Preventable premature deaths from CLRD decreased most in large central metropolitan counties where the benchmark was achieved in 2019 and increased slightly in noncore counties (+0.8%)", ". Although using time-varying benchmarks would better account for potential improvements over time in the benchmark rates, time-varying benchmarks also would make temporal and geographic comparisons more difficult. The same benchmarks were applied to both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties, and benchmarks were not adjusted for other characteristics that might affect death rates (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity). Deaths attributed to COVID-19 from 2020 through June 2022 were excluded from this study.", ".

Detailed community-based evaluations might clarify how various risk factors and social determinants of health relate to premature mortality and related rural-urban disparities. In addition, other methods for developing benchmark rates might be helpful, including using benchmarks based on the nonmetropolitan areas with the lowest death rates, or updating benchmarks based on more recent data, especially for causes of death (e.g., cancer) that have decreased substantially over time. In addition, more detailed analyses by race, ethnicity, and age, along with examining preventable deaths among persons aged >80 years, and preventable premature deaths from other causes (especially causes that are more prevalent in rural counties) might be informative.", "- CDC.

Age groupings varied by cause of death. (Most were 10-year age groups; however, the size of the youngest age group ranged from 0 to 9 years for unintentional injury to 0 to 49 years for CLRD and cerebrovascular disease because deaths from those causes are rare among younger persons.) For each age group and cause of death, the death rates of the three states with the lowest rates during 2008\u20132010 (benchmark states) were averaged to produce benchmark rates (18) (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42342).

Reporting trends in preventable premature deaths over a 12-year period highlights differences over time and might aid in understanding underlying structural, environmental, and social risk factors. Because of increasing percentages of preventable premature deaths in recent years for specific causes of death and certain demographic groups, these data might augment traditional rate comparisons and help guide focused public health interventions. Comparing the findings in this report with data from tools such as the CDC Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke (https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas/index", "., combustible tobacco use) also have driven cancer mortality downward (22). Access to these cancer prevention and early detection strategies was increased with the expansion of Medicaid (23). New cancer treatments and therapies, specifically for lung cancer and melanoma, also have led to longer survival for those with a cancer diagnosis (24). CDC conducted a demonstration project on how to best provide care for persons living in rural areas who had cancer diagnosed (25). Although cancer is categorized as a single disease group in this analysis, each cancer site has different risk factors, has varying treatment methods, and can manifest itself in different ways among groups by sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Preventable premature death might vary depending on the cancer site and might not have decreased for cancers with increasing prevalence of risk factors (e.g., obesity), no recommended screening modalities, or therapies that have not changed", "- Lange SJ, Ritchey MD, Goodman AB, et al.

Because each of the five leading causes of death is age related, these conditions are more prevalent in rural areas of the United States where residents typically are older than their urban counterparts. Working-age adults might leave rural areas to seek better economic opportunities elsewhere (8), and older persons might be more likely to retire in rural areas (9). However, the population\u2019s age structure alone does not explain the disparity in mortality. Instead, differences in social circumstances, socioeconomic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and access to health care services affect mortality and potentially contribute to approximately half of all preventable premature deaths (10). County-level disparities in all-cause premature deaths by rurality, race, and ethnicity have been documented (11)", "Overall, the decrease in preventable premature deaths from cancer was substantial and was greatest in urban counties where access to preventive services, treatment, survivor care, and specialty care is much higher than in rural counties (19). Large central metropolitan and fringe metropolitan areas achieved the benchmark rates in 2019. This is consistent with overall declines in cancer mortality, which decreased 27% between 2001 and 2020 (20). The decrease in preventable premature deaths likely reflects multiple factors. Increases in recommended screening for the leading causes of deaths from cancer (e.g., lung, colon, cervical, and female breast) have led to earlier detection, when treatment is more effective, and prevention by detecting cellular changes before they turn into cancer, as in the case of colorectal cancer (21). Increases in vaccination rates for cancer-causing viruses and decreases in prevalence of risk factors (e.g", ". Patients might have delayed or avoided seeking emergency care when experiencing a life-threatening event during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (35).

Geographic differences in combustible tobacco use and use of lung cancer screening likely partially drive differences in lung cancer mortality. Access to lung cancer screening facilities is more limited in rural counties than in urban counties (26). Despite overall reductions in preventable premature deaths from cancer, premature deaths surpass the national average in micropolitan and noncore counties, highlighting the need in rural areas to reduce cancer-related premature deaths. Because more urban areas surpassed the 2010 benchmarks for cancer death rates in 2019, future updates to the cancer-specific benchmarks using more recent years of data might better reflect the lowest achievable death rates.", "Disparities in preventable premature deaths from heart disease and stroke between rural and urban areas existed across the study period. These gaps increased from 2019 to June 2022, except in large central metropolitan counties where a decrease of three percentage points was observed from 2020 to 2021. Increases in preventable premature deaths from heart disease and stroke in 2020 and 2021 were likely associated with COVID-19\u2013related conditions that contributed to risk-associated increased mortality from heart disease and stroke (32). Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a leading risk factor for heart disease and stroke, were observed among all age groups when comparing 2020 with 2019 (33). Inequities in control of hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure values of \u2265130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of >80 mm Hg, or both) were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic and are related to insufficient health care access, medication adherence, and monitoring (34)", "Premature deaths, all-cause mortality, and poor health outcomes are greater among residents of rural counties than of urban counties in the United States (1). In 2021, the all-cause age-adjusted death rate in the United States was 841.6 per 100,000 population. The gap in all-cause mortality between rural (nonmetropolitan) and urban (metropolitan) areas of the United States continues to widen. In 1999, the death rate in rural areas was 7% higher than in urban areas; by 2019, it was 20% higher (2). Describing premature mortality rates from the five leading causes of death (cancer, unintentional injury [e.g., unintentional poisoning including drug overdose, unintentional motor vehicle traffic crash, unintentional drowning, and unintentional fall], heart disease, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease [CLRD]) and related rural disparities might help guide public health messaging and interventions.", "The percentage of preventable premature deaths from heart disease decreased from 2010 through 2019 (from 33.5% to 28.8%), followed by a steep increase to 33.6% from 2020 through June 2022 (Figure 1). Increases from 2020 through June 2022 occurred across all rural-urban categories except for large central metropolitan counties, which experienced a decrease from 32.9% in 2020 to 30.1% in 2021 (Figure 2) (Table). Rural counties had the highest percentage of preventable premature deaths from heart disease in 2022 (45.8% in micropolitan counties and 49.4% in noncore counties) (Figure 2) (Table). Most states experienced an increase in preventable early deaths from heart disease and stroke (96% and 88% of states, respectively) from 2019 through June 2022 (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/147842).", "Description of System: Mortality data for U.S. residents from the National Vital Statistics System were used to calculate preventable premature deaths from the five leading causes of death among persons aged <80 years. CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics urban-rural classification scheme for counties was used to categorize the deaths according to the urban-rural county classification level of the decedent\u2019s county of residence (1: large central metropolitan [most urban], 2: large fringe metropolitan, 3: medium metropolitan, 4: small metropolitan, 5: micropolitan, and 6: noncore [most rural]). Preventable premature deaths were defined as deaths among persons aged <80 years that exceeded the number expected if the death rates for each cause in all states were equivalent to those in the benchmark states (i.e., the three states with the lowest rates). Preventable premature deaths were calculated separately for the six urban-rural county categories nationally, the 10 U.S", "Cancer", "Heart Disease and Stroke", ". Many fall risk factors are modifiable, implying that many falls can be prevented (31).", "This analysis used mortality data for U.S. residents from the National Vital Statistics System (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm) to calculate preventable premature deaths by urban-rural county classification from the five leading causes of death during 2010\u20132022 (heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, CLRD, and stroke). Deaths from COVID-19 were excluded to maintain consistency and facilitate the assessment of trends over time. Data for 2022 are provisional counts from January through June and were annualized for comparability with previous years.", "The percentage of preventable premature deaths from stroke decreased slightly from 2010 through 2019 (32.4% to 26.4%), followed by an increase to 33.9% through June 2022 (Figure 1). Each rural-urban category experienced steep increases from 2019 to June 2022, except for noncore counties that experienced a slight decrease from 2021 to June 2022; rural counties had the highest percentages from January to June 2022 (42.0% in micropolitan counties and 40.9% in noncore counties) (Figure 2) (Table). The highest percentages of preventable premature deaths from stroke in 2022 were in southern states (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/147842).\nDiscussion", "Rural residents, particularly those in noncore counties, experienced high percentages of preventable premature deaths during the study period. The rural-urban disparities in premature deaths varied by cause of death. However, disparities were not limited to place of residence. Disparities in all-cause premature deaths also were associated with other demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, and ethnicity) (11). For example, the highest rates of premature deaths were observed in rural counties where a majority of the population was Black, African American, American Indian, or Alaska Native (11). To address disparities in preventable premature deaths across rural and urban counties, data on disparities in cause-specific premature deaths from the five leading causes by rural-urban county category, race, and ethnicity are needed to inform interventions and health care policies for specific racial and ethnic groups", "The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, applying benchmarks (e.g., the three states with the lowest rates) to all urban-rural county categories facilitates comparisons but might not represent the lowest death rates achievable by certain subgroups. For example, large metropolitan areas met the benchmarks for cancer in 2019 and, therefore, had negative estimates of preventable premature deaths during 2019\u20132022. In these instances, negative estimates were truncated at zero to indicate that the 2010 benchmarks had been achieved. Using urban-rural\u2013specific benchmarks would likely result in larger numbers of preventable premature deaths in certain categories and larger rural-urban disparities in certain cases. However, using benchmarks specific to state, age, cause, and subgroup (e.g", "Rural public health needs and sociodemographic characteristics of rural populations are changing (12). Although the proportion of the U.S. population that lives in rural areas is gradually declining, any rural population growth can be attributed to in-migration, which might require sensitivity to cultural differences (13,14). With gradual declines in population, the wealth and tax bases of rural counties also are decreasing, resulting in reduced funding for social and health services (15).", ". Fourth, the numbers of preventable premature deaths by cause are not necessarily independent, and the numbers of potentially excess deaths from the five causes cannot be combined to generate a total. For example, the number of preventable premature deaths from cancer might be lower because persons with cancer died from another cause (e.g., heart disease). Fifth, deaths from certain causes might have increased partly because of COVID-19 and the pandemic. Specifically, misclassification of deaths from COVID-19 that were attributed to other causes (because of lack of testing or reporting on the death certificate) could have contributed to a greater number of deaths across other causes and by rural and urban areas. In addition, certain causes of death might have increased because of indirect pandemic-related effects (e.g., reduced access to emergency care or life-saving treatments)", "., urban-rural, sex, race, and ethnicity) also could lead to less stable estimates because of smaller numbers of deaths when stratifying by multiple demographic and geographic dimensions. Second, the differences cannot be attributed solely to population size and geographic location because risk factors do not occur randomly in populations and are related to well-known social, demographic, environmental, economic, and geographic attributes of the neighborhoods in which persons live and work (39). Third, estimates of preventable premature deaths using historical benchmarks (e.g., 2008\u20132010) might not reflect improvements in mortality that could have occurred in a later year. For example, the 2010 benchmarks for cancer are higher than if benchmarks were based on 2022 data because of decreases in cancer deaths during 2010\u20132022", "Conclusion\nDefining preventable premature deaths within the context of the five leading causes of death does not capture the full spectrum of preventable mortality. The degree to which these deaths could be prevented is related to various factors, including distinct prevention strategies, varying risk factors, and the availability of effective interventions, all of which vary by cause. Not all premature deaths are equally preventable among the leading causes or even within each specific leading cause category, as exemplified by certain types of cancer (40).", "The risk for premature death is associated with modifiable factors that vary by disease (3). Four of the five leading risk factors for premature death are more prevalent in rural areas of the United States: using tobacco, obesity, physical inactivity, and drinking alcohol or drinking in excess (4,5). Extensive literature on social determinants of health has established the importance of community context in shaping all aspects of health (6). Structural factors (e.g., lower socioeconomic status, limited access to health care professionals, and limited job opportunities) increase the risk for premature death among rural residents (7).", "\u2020 Data for 2022 are provisional counts from January through June and were annualized for comparability with previous years.\nSuggested citation for this article: Garc\u00eda MC, Rossen LM, Matthews K, et al.

Narrowing rural-urban disparities in the percentage of preventable premature deaths from unintentional injury were driven by worsening rates of preventable mortality in more urban areas, with the percentage more than doubling in large central metropolitan areas over the study period. For drug overdoses, access to medications for opioid use disorder continues to be more limited in rural counties, as evidenced by low buprenorphine dispensing rates and reduced treatment capacity (28). For motor vehicle traffic crashes, rural residents have an increased risk for death and are less likely than urban residents to wear seat belts (29). Evidence-based interventions reduce rural-urban disparities in seat belt use and motor vehicle death rates (30)", ". In all county categories, preventable premature deaths from stroke decreased from 2010 to 2013, remained constant from 2013 to 2019, and then increased in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Percentages of preventable premature deaths varied across states by urban-rural county classification during 2010\u20132022.", "The percentage of preventable premature deaths from unintentional injury increased from 2010 to 2019 (from 38.8% to 53.8%), followed by a steep increase from 2019 to 2021 and a slight decrease through June 2022 to 63.5% (Figure 1). Increases in preventable premature deaths from unintentional injury during 2010\u20132022 were statistically significant for all metropolitan categories except micropolitan. Rural percentages were higher than in urban areas, but the gap narrowed (Figure 2). The percentages increased in all states except Wyoming, but the increase varied widely at the state level (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/147842).", "Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease\nDespite the overall decrease during 2010\u20132020 (because of decreases observed in larger urban areas), the percentage of preventable premature deaths from CLRD was relatively stable in medium and small urban counties and rural counties during 2010\u20132015. During 2010\u20132022, the sharpest decline in preventable premature death from CLRD in urban areas occurred from 2019 through 2021 and could be the result of deaths from COVID-19 that otherwise would have been attributable to CLRD.

They estimated the number of years of life lost for each risk factor at the individual level and its contribution to preventable death at the societal level (PAF = Population Attributable Fraction).", "As shown in summary Table 2, at an individual level, smoking is the single greatest risk of avoidable death, followed by diabetes and high alcohol consumption. At the population level, diabetes and high alcohol consumption have a low prevalence. Physical inactivity, smoking and low socioeconomic status (SES) are then the top three preventable causes of early death. Smoking, physical inactivity and low SES account for almost two thirds of all avoidable deaths.\nA puzzling finding is the small contribution of obesity as a cause of avoidable premature death. There are two reasons why obesity is not an important independent risk factor, as is often assumed.\nFirst, being overweight is a risk for early death without correcting for confounding risk factors. Overweight is usually measured by the body mass index (BMI = kg/m2), which is much easier to measure than physical activity.

For example: Low physical activity and obesity go hand in hand. People who are physically inactive tend to gain weight, and people who are severely obese have difficulty exercising. The unique advantage of the huge amount of individual data in the Stringhini study is that it allows (estimation of) the relative contribution of each separate risk factor.", "[edit]It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds\u2014100,000 per day\u2014die of age-related causes.

The WHO definition of 'normal' adult BMI (between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2) is based on a normal weight and height distribution of US citizens in the 1960s, not on the associated risk of death in 2023. A meta-analysis of the association between BMI and mortality in 230 cohort studies with 3.74 million deaths among 30.3 million participants found that the risk of death in adults is not increased between 23 and 30 kg/m2 (see Figure 2).

First, the same method used in a previous report was applied to set a benchmark for potentially preventable deaths (2). These benchmarks are based on data from the states with the lowest death rates for each condition during 2008\u20132010 alone. The benchmarks might need to be reevaluated over time, especially given shifts in cause-specific death rates observed using provisional mortality data from 2015\u20132016.\u2020\u2020\u2020 For example, death rates from unintentional injury were increasing before 2008\u20132010, resulting in benchmarks that might not be comparable to historical lows or international points of reference. Second, alternative ways of defining and measuring potentially preventable or premature avoidable mortality have been used in other studies and no gold standard exists (10). Third, a lowest average rate was calculated based on individual states", "There has been a significant decrease in the number of potentially preventable deaths among three of the five leading causes of death (diseases of the heart, cancer, and stroke) during 2010\u20132014. However, the number of potentially preventable deaths from unintentional injuries increased significantly during the same period. This is mostly attributed to an increase in drug poisoning (overdose from prescription and illicit drugs) and falls. No significant change was observed in potentially preventable deaths from chronic lower respiratory disease (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema).\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?", "Although the number of potentially preventable deaths declined during 2010\u20132014 for heart disease, cancer, and stroke, observed deaths increased overall for these causes. Based on the methodology used for this analysis, when the pace of the increase in observed deaths is slower than the growth in population, potentially preventable deaths will decrease. Observed deaths increased 6% for heart disease, 4% for cancer, 4% for stroke, and 8% for CLRD. These increases were smaller than would be expected to result from population growth, particularly growth in population size among older age groups during this period.", "The number of potentially preventable deaths for each of the five leading causes of death by state in 2014 was calculated in four steps. The first step was to calculate and rank state disease-specific death rates by age group. Using 2008\u20132010 data, the three states with the lowest observed death rates for each age group and specific cause of death category were selected and their death rates averaged across the three states to calculate a lowest average age-specific death rate for each cause of death. For example, during 2008\u201310, among persons aged 40\u201349 years, the three states with the lowest rate of death from unintentional injuries were Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, and the benchmark average was 25.2 (supplemental material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42342).", ".

The sum of the individual potentially preventable deaths by state is qualitatively different from estimating the number of potentially preventable deaths for the United States as a whole. Fourth, changes in the number of potentially preventable deaths by cause are not necessarily independent. For example, whereas some cancer deaths might be prevented entirely, some might be shifted into another cause grouping, such as heart disease. Finally, defining potentially preventable deaths across the five leading causes does not take into consideration the fact that these are complex and diverse causes of death. Not all deaths are equivalently preventable across the leading causes or within each leading cause. For example, certain types of cancer might be considered more or less preventable than other types, and some specific mechanisms of injury deaths (e.g., drug poisoning) might be considered completely preventable and other mechanisms less preventable", "* http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf.\n\u2020 Diseases of the heart codes I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51; cancer C00-C97; CLRD J40-J47; cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) I60-I69; and unintentional injuries V01-X59, Y85-Y86.\n\u00a7 Standard error = the square root of [expected number + observed number of deaths].", "Population estimates for 2010 and 2014 were produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The calculations of potentially preventable deaths were restricted to U.S. residents and deaths in persons aged <80 years. Premature death was defined as a death that occurred in a person aged <80 years, based on the average life expectancy for the total U.S. population, which was nearly 79 years in 2010 (2). Analysis was restricted to deaths with an underlying cause of death among the five leading causes, based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes.\u2020 The five leading causes of death represented 63% of all deaths in 2014, a decrease of 2.3% compared with 2010. In 2014 the next five most frequent causes accounted for approximately 12% of deaths (3).", "Consistent with increases in population since 2010, particularly among older age groups, the number of observed deaths increased for each of the five leading causes of deaths in 2014, and age-adjusted death rates declined during 2010\u20132014 for each category except unintentional injuries. Specifically, from 2010 to 2014, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 population for heart disease declined 6.8% from 179.1 to 167.0; for cancer, from 172.8 to 161.2 (6.7% decrease); for stroke, from 39.1 to 36.5 (6.6% decrease); and for CLRD, from 42.2 to 40.5 (4.0% decrease). For unintentional injuries, age-adjusted death rates increased 6.6%, from 38.0 to 40.5 (supplemental material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42341) (1). Among subcategories of unintentional injury deaths for all ages, age-adjusted death rates for poisonings increased 25%, and falls increased by 12% (supplemental material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42344)", "Public health officials can use the decreases observed as benchmarks for improving population health, while using observed increases to direct targeted efforts to reduce the number of potentially preventable deaths. A joint effort of public health and health care organizations can support analysis and action to reduce the number of potentially preventable deaths from the five leading causes of death. Specifically, given the reported increase in potentially preventable deaths from unintentional injuries, these findings might inform the selection and implementation of evidence-based interventions to prevent deaths from injuries such as falls and drug overdoses, based on epidemiologic burden.", "Although substantial progress was made in combatting infectious diseases during the early part of the 20th century, additional focus has shifted toward prevention of noncommunicable diseases, including chronic diseases, and unintentional injuries (5,6). The decrease in cancer deaths can be attributed, in part, to progress in prevention, early detection, and treatment (7). Improvement of quality of care and reduction in risk factors, including increased number of persons with hypertension under control, have contributed to the decline in death rates for heart disease and stroke.** Tobacco use is a risk factor for some of the deaths included in this report, such as heart disease, cancer, CLRD, and cerebrovascular diseases.\u2020\u2020 Mortality from tobacco-related causes has decreased in conjunction with national decreases in tobacco use across the United States, but an estimated 40 million adults (16.8%) smoked in 2014 (8)", "To determine significant changes in the number of potentially preventable deaths for the five leading causes of death in the United States, CDC analyzed National Vital Statistics System mortality data from 2014 (1) using the same analytic model presented in the original report that used 2010 data as benchmarks (2). The number of potentially preventable deaths per year per state in persons aged <80 years was determined by comparing the number of expected deaths (based on the cause-specific average death rate of the three states with the lowest 2008\u20132010 average rate by age groups) with the number of observed deaths in 2010 and 2014. Further detail on age-adjusted rates by state and cause can be found in yearly publications on final death data (1).", "The average of the lowest three states was chosen to minimize the effect of any extreme outlier and to represent the low end of the distribution of death rates among the states. The second step was to calculate expected deaths for each age group and state by multiplying the age-specific state populations for 2010 by the 2010 benchmark death rates (i.e., the lowest three-state average age-specific death rates for each cause). Total expected deaths for each cause and state were calculated by summing expected deaths over all age groups aged <80 years, effectively taking into account differences in mortality across age groups. These state-specific and cause-specific expected death counts represent the number of deaths expected if all states were to achieve the 2010 death rate benchmarks (2). Third, the 2010 potentially preventable deaths were calculated by subtracting expected deaths from 2010 observed deaths", "Death rates by specific causes vary across the 50 states and the District of Columbia.* Information on differences in rates for the leading causes of death among states might help state health officials determine prevention goals, priorities, and strategies. CDC analyzed National Vital Statistics System data to provide national and state-specific estimates of potentially preventable deaths among the five leading causes of death in 2014 and compared these estimates with estimates previously published for 2010.

Examples of state actions to reduce drug overdose include developing or enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs, adopting clinical prescribing guidelines, and increasing access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder and naloxone to reverse opioid-related poisoning (9). As the U.S. population aged, falls among older adults increased. Tools such as STEADI, designed to assist clinicians in assessing fall risk, educating patients, and selecting interventions, are available from CDC.***", ". Implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interventions, including increased tobacco product prices, implementation and enforcement of comprehensive smoke-free laws, media campaigns, and access to proven resources (e.g., quit lines) to help persons quit tobacco use\u00a7\u00a7 varies among states. In addition to tobacco use, other health behaviors contribute to premature deaths and create opportunities for prevention.

Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and dementia, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy (8). Furthermore, global increases in high fasting plasma glucose and its sequelae, type 2 diabetes, have mirrored the increases seen in BMI over the past 3 decades (9). Other behavioral risks (eg, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, inadequate sleep, excessive alcohol use); environmental risks (eg, air pollution, extreme temperatures); and social risks (eg, house and food insecurity) also contribute to increased CVD burden and disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (10)", "CVD and its related risk factors are increasingly recognized as growing indicators of global health disparities (17). Globally, differences in morbidity and mortality from CVD exist among high-, middle-, and low-income countries and across ethnic groups (1,3,5,6,17,18). In the US, disparities in CVD morbidity, mortality, and risk factors have persisted for decades, with concerning stagnation and significant upward trends since the early 2000s (18). Disparities are largely influenced by demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors (19,20). For example, African American and American Indian adults experience a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors and CVD compared with non-Hispanic White adults (18). Unfortunately, structural racism remains a significant cause of poor cardiovascular health, restricting racial and ethnic minority populations from opportunities to live healthier lives, in healthier neighborhoods, and from access to quality education and health care (20).", ". Their findings indicate that community-based settings are effective in increasing knowledge of CVD-related risk factors and access to health promotion resources to reach minority populations (33).", "Implications", "- Examining factors contributing to CVD risk\n- Exploring factors contributing to disparities in CVD\n- Using community-based approaches to decrease CVD\nExamining the Factors Contributing to CVD Risk", "Collaborative innovations are beneficial to prevent, manage, and control CVD and risk factors. For example, as described by Abbas and colleagues, several clinicians and health care organizations were able to accelerate innovation and adapt services to maintain hypertension control among their high-risk populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, informing future collaborative efforts related to hypertension control during and after a public health emergency (37). Furthermore, as highlighted by Ramalingam and colleagues from their work in India, there is a need to invigorate and transform the public health workforce to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases. They do so through the innovative Field Epidemiology Training Program in noncommunicable diseases, which enhances workforce capacity in CVD epidemiology, surveillance, and evaluation to inform CVD control programs and policies", ". Future research and evaluation of programs should focus on developing practical and innovative strategies, identifying and overcoming the barriers to access to quality care, and applying a health equity lens to accelerate advances in CVD prevention and control at the community, state, national, and global levels.", "This collection also offers multiple recommendations and tools to identify SDOH and address disparities in CVD. For example, Le and colleagues introduce a powerful interactive visualization tool to identify county-level death rates and trends for several CVD outcomes by different sociodemographic characteristics. This online dashboard provides maps, line plots, and charts useful for health practitioners and community leaders to identify and address health inequities in CVD mortality (28). Taken together, the variations identified across different geographic, racial, or ethnic groups, as described in this theme of the collection, call for urgent actions to address disparities to understand the reasons for these variations (eg, inequities in access to care and receiving treatments). Results indicate that addressing SDOH, including equitable availability and accessibility of resources, is necessary to mitigate the factors that influence the development of CVD disparities.", "Acknowledgments\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the authors\u2019 own and do not necessarily reflect the views or position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This special PCD collection of 20 articles published from January 2020 through November 2022 highlights some of these efforts by using multiple data sources collected before or during the pandemic.

By using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Parekh and colleagues highlight the association of race and ethnicity and geographic location with disparities in influenza vaccination coverage among adults with CVD in the US, recommending prioritization of vulnerable populations looking beyond clinical settings as a place of vaccination (26). Compounding the challenge of seasonal influenza infection, the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 another viral respiratory infectious disease \u2014 has exacerbated the health conditions of people with CVD worldwide and intensified disparities in CVD mortality rates in the US (6). In the US, African American, Hispanic, and Asian American populations experienced a disproportionate rise in deaths caused by heart disease and stroke, suggesting that these groups have been most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (6)", "The greatest contributors to CVD-related years of life lost globally are tobacco exposure, hypertension, high body mass index (BMI), and high fasting plasma glucose (3). Tobacco exposure, including cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke, and use of smokeless tobacco, contributed to 8.7 million deaths worldwide in 2019, one-third of which were due to CVD (3). Hypertension affects more than 4 billion people worldwide, representing a near doubling in the absolute prevalence of hypertension since 1990 (3). In the US, nearly half of adults (47%) have hypertension, but only about 1 in 4 (24%) have their condition under control (7). Elevated BMI continues to increase globally, with significant effects on death, disability, and quality of life (3). The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past 50 years, reaching pandemic levels", ". Goulding and colleagues used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected from 2011 through 2018 to provide estimates of the prevalence of high blood pressure among US children aged 8 to 17 years. The authors documented that elevated blood pressure was most prevalent among children who were older, male, or non-Hispanic Black, with factors beyond inequalities in body weight likely contributing to disparities in elevated blood pressure (12). Furthermore, a meta-analysis conducted by Qie and colleagues determined that a high level of HDL-C may provide a protective effect on the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke but may increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (13)", "Several studies in this collection identify strategies for community-based interventions that aim to reduce CVD disparities. For example, Long and colleagues evaluated 3-year sodium reduction initiatives in 3 community meal programs in Arkansas (31). Jordan and colleagues demonstrated the differential effects of sodium reduction strategies in food service settings by tailoring community-level approaches based on a community\u2019s available resources, stage of readiness, and food service staff\u2019s level of engagement (32). These studies show the effectiveness and sustainability of the implementation of sodium reduction interventions in reducing CVD in communities experiencing food insecurity, low incomes, and high risk for hypertension (31,32). The work from Smith and colleagues in Arkansas examines the benefits of using trusted community spaces such as barber and beauty shops for screening for chronic health conditions including blood pressure monitoring", "Several studies in this collection examine the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, including race, ethnicity, and geography, and CVD disparities. Within this broad topic, Tong and colleagues examined data on more than 1 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 66 years or older hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). They identified significant racial, ethnic, and geographic variations in 5-year survival rates after AIS, with African American men and people living in the state of Hawaii having the lowest survival rate (21).

In 2020, an estimated 523 million people had some form of CVD, and approximately 19 million deaths were attributable to CVD; this represents approximately 32% of all global deaths and is an absolute increase of 18.7% from 2010 (1,2). Global trends for disability-adjusted life years for CVD and the CVD burden attributable to modifiable risk factors have also continued to increase steadily since 1990 (3). In the US, nearly half of adults (approximately 127 million) had 1 or more CVD condition (2).

The current cigarette smoking prevalence in the US reached 51.9% among adults aged 18 to 44 years with 2 or more chronic diseases (11). Furthermore, that study showed that smoking cessation services were not being provided to almost 1 in 3 people who have a chronic disease, leaving important steps to be taken toward successful smoking cessation in this population (11).

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity", ". Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and suggest it is better to focus on high value preventive care, taking into account increased longevity and quality of life.", "Primary care physicians' participation in the Medicare shared savings program and preventive services delivery: Evidence from the first 7 years.Health Serv Res. 2022 Oct;57(5):1182-1190. doi: 10.1111/1475-6773.14030.

Building on Weinstein and colleagues (2003), we consider an economic evaluation model for preventive interventions as any analytic methodology that accounts for events over time and across populations, that is based on primary or secondary data, and with the aim of estimating the effects of an intervention on valued health and other societal consequences and costs. Models are valuable not only because of their results, which depend on their inputs, both data and assumptions, but also because the construction of a model, regardless of the framework, helps to answer these basic policy questions: Do we know enough to act and, if not, what do we need better information about?", "State legislative cost estimates. The Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP) is a non-partisan legislative research unit that has developed a method for prospectively estimating the costs and benefits of proposed legislative policies for the State. They use a benefit-cost framework for their analyses, to include estimates of impacts to society as a whole, including taxpayers, those individuals directly impacted by a policy, and other people in society indirectly impacted by a policy. WSIPP describes their research approach as follows. First, determine what works and what does not; what is efficient; what is the risk to the state in implementing individual policy options; and what interventions might be implemented together in a \u201cportfolio\u201d to achieve a common goal (WSIPP, 2012).

The PCEHM present the example of a hypothetical medical device that is cost-effective or cost-saving from the hospital\u2019s perspective, but achieved this success by transferring costs to other aspects of the health care system (Gold et al., 1996). To facilitate comparisons across studies, and to avoid cherry picking of favorable perspectives, current cost-effectiveness standards recommend the inclusion of the a societal (or health care if societal is not feasible) perspective as a reference case, even if the primary interest of the paper is to examine differences in cost-effectiveness at a more granular level.", "The authors adopt a benefit\u2212cost framework at the broadest level, in view of the twin objectives of improving both social welfare and the equitable distribution of health across a population, and also because of the multiple sectors implicated in the cause and prevention of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. In particular, the framework considers whether and how individual choices in the realm of diet, physical activity, smoking, and drinking involve failures of information (ignorance of consequences), failure to capture externalities of consumption (e.g., in unhealthy foods or education) in their private costs and individual benefits, or failures of rationality (e.g., as with addictive substances).

However, some CEA practitioners do not believe that such impacts are reflected in the relative values people assign to different health states in the preference elicitation studies that underlie QALYs.", ".

The authors note that \u201cinequalities in age at death appear to be reduced only to a small extent, whereas the extent to which inequalities between socioeconomic groups may be reduced depends crucially on possible differences in the effectiveness of interventions between the relevant groups [and the model assumes equal effectiveness across groups] (p. 58).\u201d", "A second broad strategy is to estimate WTP based on market information about related goods, referred to as revealed preference methods. One source of revealed preferences for estimating the value of health and mortality risk reductions is the compensating wage differential for riskier jobs, controlling for other factors that affect wage levels (wage-risk studies). Another source of revealed preferences for risk reductions is the voluntary purchase of safety equipment such as bicycle helmets by consumers. WTP estimates of the value of changes in the risk of premature mortality, using either or both stated and revealed preference studies, have been formulated as the value of a statistical life (VSL). VSL is a theoretical construct representing the aggregation over a large population of the value of reducing a relatively small risk of mortality.

The intervention was assumed to be ongoing for the course of the model period. The authors did not assume any diminution from the effectiveness achieved in the first year and noted that they also did not build in additional positive impacts (reductions in disease rates) in years subsequent to the first.", "Return-on-Investment (RoI) analysis. RoI analysis is a form of cost analysis that typically addresses the financial consequences of an intervention from the standpoint of a particular payer, such as employer. RoI is expressed as a ratio of profits (or cost savings) for a given enterprise within a certain period divided by dollars invested during that same period to achieve that level of profit or cost savings. In the case of a prevention intervention that provides a worksite program to encourage physical activity, the costs of facilitating increased physical activity by investments such as subsidizing gym memberships, installing and maintaining onsite exercise equipment, organizing group walks, or promoting personal daily walking goals would be compared to the difference between actual and predicted medical claims payments for either all or some (presumably related) health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), and between actual and predicted absenteeism costs", "Aggregate models refer to models estimated at the population level. Examples of aggregate-level models are decision-tree and some state-transition models (see below), where the model estimates are created from multiplying transition probabilities times the proportion of the population in a given state. In contrast, microsimulations and agent-based models (see below) are examples of individual-level models. As their name implies, individual-level models estimate the model\u2019s processes at the level of an individual agent. These agents have both memory and embedded decision rules that govern their behavior. Aggregate-level models have the advantage of producing cleaner estimates and are easier to program and manage. Individual-level models may offer some advantages in modeling group interactions, and can also be used to ease the modeling of very complex systems.", "U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The third USPSTF initiated a process and designed a tool for systematically reviewing cost-effectiveness analysis as an aid in making recommendations about clinical preventive services (Saha et al., 2001). For a period, USPSTF reviewed CEAs only for those services with relevant questions about cost effectiveness. Specific requirements for the use of CEAs in its recommendation process included: conduct a systematic analysis only when there is reasonable evidence that the intervention in question is effective; include only studies that assess health outcomes (rather than process outcomes); and use only those conducted from the societal perspective and from the perspective of a general population", "The Commission\u2019s guidance for extending the clinical preventive services priority-setting framework to community-based services addresses the range of services included in the exercise, prioritization criteria and strategies, evidence review methods, and presentation of results (2009).

Notably, CBO\u2019s 25- and 75-year Long Term Budget Outlook projections report spending as a percentage of GDP. In the context of prevention, a short projection period is problematic. Many current prevention activities target behavior that will not have a serious health consequence for years to come. As we saw with the other modeling methodologies, lifetime or at least 25-year estimates are more common.

Differences in estimates can occur from the application of the model to a different context, through differences in model specification, or from the incorporation of new or different data inputs.

Because of the complexity of developing dynamic models, static models are more frequently used and likely preferable, except in circumstances where the intervention is likely to affect the transmission of disease.

In scientific practice, validation refers to the ability of an experiment or scientific inquiry to uncover true causal relationships, and the extent to which the relationships in the study can be extended to other situations. In the world of prevention modeling, researchers construct mathematical representations of reality in order to test the impact of changes in policy or treatment. The key questions of validity regard whether the results generated by the model can be used to make policy decisions.", "National Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP). Since 1997, the National Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP), organized by the Partnership for Prevention, has produced rankings and presented underlying information to guide priority setting for preventive services, initially clinical services, but recently proposing a framework for community-based interventions that address a variety of diseases, risk factors, and behaviors (Maciosek et al., 2006; 2009). Although the Commission intends its framework to apply to both community and clinical interventions, the most recent rankings (2006) evaluate clinical preventive services recommended by the USPSTF, and immunizations recommended by ACIP through December 2004.", "Modeling uncertainty. Estimates derived from prevention models contain uncertainty from at least three sources. Individual random variation is referred to as first-order variability, and usually occurs in agent-based models that allow for individual differentiation within cohorts. First-order variability is not a primary concern in most prevention models.", "This section reviews the initial study design choices that shape cost-effectiveness analyses and then reviews options involved for performing sensitivity analyses.\nEstimation and standards of the baseline analysis. The initial design of a cost-effectiveness study involves a set of choices that will shape the results that flow from the analyses. These choices include how outcomes will be measured, the selection of a comparator, a specification of the time horizon, the extent to which future costs and benefits will be discounted to reflect their present value, and the perspective of the study which will determine which types of costs and benefits will be included in the analysis.", "Both traditional clinical trials and pilot or demonstration community-based interventions evidence selection effects. Often the study population is chosen for their clinical profile (e.g., absence of comorbidities) or their willingness to participate. This introduces at least some level of selection bias and can complicate the ability of modelers to project the trial or intervention population to broader populations such as all Medicare beneficiaries or the U.S. population overall. A related problem is the under- representation of key policy subpopulations, such as underserved or economically disadvantaged communities, seniors, or children. How can study populations be selected to be representative of the broader population the policy may cover? Can more representative trial/intervention populations be developed?", "Because CEA produces a ratio, a consistent definition of what counts as a cost in contrast to what counts as an effect is important for comparability across analyses. In 1993 the U.S. Public Health Service established an expert committee, the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (PCEHM), to improve the quality and comparability of CEAs used in health policy and medical decision making by recommending best practices. In its 1996 report (Gold et al.) the PCEHM made recommendations for measuring and distinguishing between costs and benefits. The PCEHM codified their recommended best practices as a reference case\u2014taking a societal perspective\u2014that all health-related CEAs should present, in addition to presenting any other analyses (e.g., from the perspective of a particular payer.)", ".4, we discuss the underlying principals and rationale for using the results of economic models of preventive interventions, namely to assist in making difficult decisions under conditions of uncertainty.", ". Cost-effectiveness is particularly sensitive to assumptions about the persistence or waning of vaccine efficacy over time; published studies have documented the persistence of protective effect for just under a decade, so this is a major source of uncertainty in modeling results.", "Univariate sensitivity analyses. Univariate sensitivity analyses offer a common approach to testing variation in a single parameter. In univariate sensitivity analyses, a parameter\u2019s value is varied to the extremes of its plausible ranges while holding constant other variables in the model, in order to assess the impact of that single variable on the model\u2019s results. Univariate sensitivity analyses are quite valuable in identifying the parameters to which the model is most sensitive.\nOften the results of multiple univariate sensitivity analyses are arranged in a tornado diagram, listing the most influential variable in terms of its impact on the ICER at the top to the least influential variable tested at the bottom. For example, Figure 4 illustrates the univariate sensitivity of a new screening strategy for hepatitis C to one-at-a-time changes in model parameters.", "Unlike the Milken study, the Urban Institute model did not project forward current disease prevalence trends. However, it also focused exclusively on medical expenditure impacts, and projected increases in medical spending using CMS projections.", "QALY metrics have been derived from both psychometrics (the theory and techniques of measuring psychological phenomena such as attitudes) and utility theory. Typically QALY metrics are constructed using a combination of psychological survey and decision-theoretical techniques. As preference-based measures, the values assigned to specific health states in an HRQL scale reflects the relative strength of preference for one state as compared with another.\nThe four most common methods for eliciting preferences for health states are: standard gamble (SG); time trade-off (TTO); category rating (CR) or visual analogue scale (VAS); and person trade-off (PTO).", "Agent-based models can be programmed in a variety of commercial software packages, or can be coded using generic packages such as spreadsheets, MATLAB, Java, or C++. The primary disadvantages of agent-based models are the difficulty and time entailed in programming them.\nMicrosimulation. Microsimulation offers another approach in individual-level modeling. Rather than depending on a created set of agents governed by computer-simulated algorithms, a microsimulation is based on a data set that describes a sample of individuals, households, or organizations. Rules are applied to update the individual members of the sample over time, essentially building in an aging process and other probabilistic transitions.

It has also performed poorly, relative to other approaches, in tests of reliability and internal consistency (Patrick et al., 1973; Ubel et al., 1996). Because the person trade-off technique requires posing a large number of choices to construct a robust set of relative values for different diseases, it is cognitively challenging, and has been found to be less reliable and less internally consistent than other approaches (Green, 2001; Ubel et al., 1996).", "Economic assessments of clinical or community-based interventions to affect the development or treatment of obesity can be in many respects similar to those of interventions for the prevention or management of type 2 diabetes. Weight loss or BMI is typically an intermediate outcome in the analysis of diabetes interventions. For example, Roux and colleagues (2008), in the analysis of physical activity interventions discussed above, explicitly focused on particular disease endpoints, with weight loss or BMI as an implicit mechanism, to avoid double-counting impact. Conversely, in the models of the economic impact of obesity-related interventions, specific disease endpoints (type 2 diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular events, and conditions) frequently account for the estimated cost savings for reductions in obesity.

Value-of-information (VOI) analyses quantify the potential opportunity losses that can result from making an incorrect decision between mutually exclusive policy options. Choosing between policy options always entails a degree of uncertainty and a consequent probability of an incorrect decision. VOI analyses build off simulation results to estimate the dollar value of additional research on a topic with the aim of reducing uncertainty. VOI analyses can help set priorities for additional research by identifying which decisions could result in the greatest opportunity losses if made incorrectly and by identifying the value of additional information gained about specific parameters used to make those decisions.", "The relatively recent introduction of both a quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) and a bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine for human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, the preponderant cause of cervical cancer, has led to a multitude of possible alternative scenarios of combined immunization and screening interventions. The economic evaluations of HPV and cervical cancer prevention strategies that have been conducted over the past decade have become increasingly complex. Yet little is known about the protection offered by the vaccines over the longer term, which introduces considerable uncertainty into the models for optimizing clinical and cost-effectiveness of mixed prevention strategies.", "External validity refers to the ability to generalize results obtained by the model to a wider set of circumstances. In most simulation contexts, external validity would refer to the ability to make decisions about the actual world based on the findings of the model. Because simulation models are always simplifications of complex systems that in themselves occur with some degree of random variation, models will rarely result in exact reproductions of empirical reality. The topic of the external validity of simulation results is quite wide and encompasses many areas of philosophy of science. Questions of how close a model\u2019s predictions must be to an externally generated dataset in order to be considered valid are in fact impossible to answer. Philosophers such as Popper, Kuhn, and Feyerabend have argued that similarity cannot be judged in absolute terms but instead must be understood relative to the situation (Feinstein and Cannon, 2001).", "The review of different forms of economic analyses in the previous section alluded to a number of their policy applications.

The first approach, cost-of-illness analysis, considered the direct costs incurred in medical care provided and the impact on human capital, the present value of productivity losses due to illness and premature death. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) avoided the monetization of health outcomes by presenting the results of an analysis as the cost to achieve a single unit of a given health outcome, which could be either a health event such as a death averted, a case of cancer prevented, or a day of illness avoided; or a synthetic measure that could represent a combination of discrete health outcomes, such as a QALY", "The \u201cPath\u201d proposal included population health initiatives aimed at lowering rates of chronic and vaccine-preventable diseases. The model developed by Lewin estimated the health care cost impact of policies addressing tobacco use, obesity, alcohol abuse, and influenza immunization. The tobacco-related interventions included a federal cigarette (and other tobacco products) tax increase (to six times the current rate) and funding of smoking cessation programs with 10 percent of the new tax revenues. Assumptions about decline in use of tobacco reflected both the increased price due to the tax and the impact of cessation programs. Based on previous studies, health care costs were estimated to decline for former smokers for 15 years, with an increase in net health care spending due to longer lives after that period. Because the model produced estimates for the first 15 years post implementation (2010-2024), subsequent reductions in savings are not reported.", "Mathematically, the physiological processes model consists of four equations: a natural projection of the variables and their interactions; the occurrence of events as a function of variables; the effect of interventions on events and variables; and the function of organs (Schlessinger and Eddy, 2002). The simulation of an agent over time uses differential equations and is a random process by assigning parameter distributions, derived from person-specific data. Any missing person-specific data is replaced with imaginary data that is consistent with real data, to accurately simulate the observed clinical events. If only aggregated data is available, it is translated into person-specific data by either using available data to model the relationship between the clinical event and an aggregated variable or making the simplifying assumption that a certain percentage of persons would experience the clinical event.", "CBO also reports whether a proposal is expected to increase the federal deficit by more than $5 billion in the subsequent four 10-year periods and produces a Long Term Budget Outlook report, which most recently (June 2011) projected federal spending for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies, among other programs, to 2035, with 75-year projections in the Appendix. These longer term budget projections, unlike 10-year projections, are reported as a share of GDP rather than in nominal dollars.

The World Health Organization (WHO) developed DALYs to serve as a summary measure of population health for the Global Burden of Disease study, launched in the mid-1990s (Murray and Acharya, 1997). The DALY measures potential years of life lost to premature death, adjusting those years to reflect the equivalent years of healthy life lost through poor health or disability. The DALY index scale inverts the QALY scale: for DALYs, 0 corresponds to perfect health and 1 to death. In contrast to QALYs, which reflect health states characterized generically, DALY values correspond to specific health conditions.", "The disadvantages of state-transition models are the greater modeling complexity when compared to decision tress, the tendencies for states to proliferate in complex models, and the lack of transparency greater complexity engenders. However, for most chronic diseases, the added complexity is well worth the benefit of model management that the structure offers.\nAgent-based models. Agent-based models function by creating individual autonomous entities that store information that dictates their behavior in future time steps of the model. An agent is a computer-simulated function or algorithm that has the ability to recall information for use in the function, and operates with autonomy from other functions in the model. It tracks the actions of a population of individuals over a set of defined time steps.", ".P17FP For example, a GCEA of prevention, screening, and treatment of colorectal cancer included within the set of interrelated interventions a full range of screening modalities with various periodicities; medical treatments for cancer; and a campaign to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables (Ginsberg et al., 2010). Once the GCEA has identified the efficient mix of interventions relative to the null set, the standard IMC-CEA should be used for additional analysis, to inform how to move from the current mix of interventions to the optimal mix.", "The Trogdon article reports on the development of a workplace obesity intervention model that simulates ROI based on specific businesses\u2019 workforce and intervention characteristics.

In the 1996 estimation of DALY weights, health professionals developed descriptions of particular disabilities and then other groups of health experts valued the disabilities, using the person trade-off method, as part of a deliberative process (Murray and Lopez, 1996; Gold et al., 2002). These DALY weights were constructed with two controversial features: higher weights given to years of adult productivity and decrements calculated from the worldwide maximum life expectancy (Japanese women). Neither feature is essential to the DALY calculation, and today DALYs have multiple formulations (de Hollander et al., 1999; Fox-Rushby and Hanson, 2001).", "Structural uncertainty refers to embedded assumptions of the model process that may be incorrect. For example, a model may assume a linear relationship between disease progression and time, when in fact this relationship is nonlinear (McKay et al., 1999). Other aspects of model uncertainty may include the options of treatment offered to patients after diagnosis. For example, in a paper on the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma treatment in the developing world, the authors developed estimates based on an assumption of a one-time laser surgical intervention following diagnosis and assumed no option for pharmaceutical treatment for diagnosed patients (Wittenborn and Rein, 2011). In practice structural or model uncertainty is rarely addressed outside of somewhat ad-hoc scenario testing of alternative outcomes.

They are well suited for problems that depend on spatial relationships, changes in individual behavior, and when modeling memory is important. Agent-based models are also well suited for modeling complex environments.

Numerical approaches are easily implemented but depend upon assumptions that may often be violated by results generated from decision-analytic approaches. For example, if one assumes that the incremental net benefit (INB) of an intervention is normally distributed, then the EVPI of an intervention can be solved as a function of the slope of the loss function, the estimated INB, and its variance. Unfortunately, INB can rarely be assumed to be normally distributed as most decision analytic models combine parameters from different experimental observations with a range of distributions. Alternatives to numeric approaches include sampling algorithms from simulation results, as well as minimal modeling, and meta-modeling techniques which attempt to replace the decision analytic model with a statistical alternative (Meltzer et al., 2011; Tappenden et al., 2004).", "Regulatory impact analysis. As previously noted, by executive order federal agencies must estimate the expected benefits and costs of proposed major regulations in an integrated analysis, and publish this impact assessment along with the proposed rule (E.O. 12291).

In BCA, both benefits and costs are calculated at the societal level and measured in monetary terms. The net benefits of alternative policy options, calculated as the difference in the total benefits and total costs of each option, can be compared to determine which intervention (if any) will maximize social welfare. The benefit-cost ratio can also be reported. This ratio is sometimes characterized as the societal return on investment.

Prescribing the modeling technique to be used (for example in a request for proposals) is likely not advantageous as every modeling approach has distinctive advantages and disadvantages compared to others. When choosing a model, the researcher should consider at least the project budget and timeline, the immediate use and future reuses of the model, and the minimum degree of complexity needed to model the problem correctly.

Further, the comparator (or complementary intervention) to the immunization intervention can vary, depending on the screening technology (two forms of cytology and HPV DNA testing, under certain conditions). The review by Kim and colleagues (2008) discusses the kinds of inputs that different types of models\u2014static versus dynamic\u2014require and the nature of the information that they can produce.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) is a simulation process to measure the impact of uncertainty across all the major parameters in the model (or at least a set of major parameters). To conduct a PSA, the researcher specifies the distributional shape and parameters for each of the variables in the model. Ideally, these parameters should be drawn from empirical data measuring the standard error of the parameter and common distributional assumptions specified to the parameter of interest (Briggs et al., 2006). In the event the parameter variance cannot be derived empirically, the modeler may construct it from the range of available estimates, to match expert opinion, or using published guidelines (Doubilet et al., 1985).", "Many federal agencies use VSL in BCAs for regulatory impact analyses.P5FP OMB guidance on VSL (Circular A-4, 2003) notes that various studies reported VSLs of between $1 million and $10 million; agencies may adopt their own estimate, as long as the rationale for the choice is given.

Second-order variability refers to the fact that the parameters used in a model are sample estimates. In the best of circumstances these parameters have been drawn from experimental studies and will have been measured with error. In many other circumstances, parameters may be based on averages of estimates across studies, on expert opinion, or simply upon assumptions.

The figure shows the spending averted on diabetes and diabetes-related complications for two cohorts, one with intensive control of their glucose levels and one with more conventional control. The intensive control cohort experiences the type of management typically found in state-of-the art diabetes disease management programs. The figure demonstrates that intensive control reduces future diabetes spending, but that those reductions do not begin until about the eighth year of the intervention, with the vast majority of the savings occurring after the first ten years.

Actuarial analysis of the financial impact of health interventions employs epidemiological and statistical data and methods (e.g., life tables) to project future spending over a defined set of programs for a given population using information about expenditures within those programs for comparable populations in previous and current periods. Actuarial analysis can vary widely in scope depending on program or system involved. For example, the financial implications of adding a preventive service as a covered benefit in a private health insurance plan would likely be limited to the impact on overall health services expenditures for the insured population, while the analysis of the same service conducted by federal actuaries for the Medicare program could include the impact not only on Medicare expenditures but also on Social Security tax revenues and payments as a result of projected changes in labor force participation and longevity.", ". In a commentary, one of the coauthors of the DPPRG study examines possible reasons for the different cost-effectiveness results, particularly as a number of clinically relevant results were similar (Engelgau, 2005).

The discount rate represents the time preference of the model for benefits that occur today in comparison to benefits that occur in the future. A foundational concept of classical microeconomics is that individuals prefer benefits gained today over identical benefits gained in the future and that the extent of this preference can be estimated based on a rate function (Menger, 1892). Put simply, individuals prefer $1 today than $1 next year and the degree of this preference can be measured by the percentage of that $1 that would have to be paid to convince someone to exchange the $1 today for the $1 next year.

Selection bias or other forms of confounders weaken the power of evidence obtained from a trial. In theory, simulation models avoid selection bias and confounders because simulated agents can be matched perfectly in terms of their traits. In practice, bias can be introduced by the modeler either through conscious or inadvertent parameter selection that favors a certain policy of choice, or through the use of low-quality data or studies to populate the model\u2019s parameters.

The notion of a causal web allows for more or less immediate influences on the occurrence of disease; risk factors can also influence other risk factors in the same or a different disease pathway.

Several years ago, in the context of policy debates leading up to the passage of ACA, several organizations and consortia independently developed multiple-disease, multiple-intervention models to estimate the potential for reducing disease burden and health care (and in some cases other) costs through new investments in clinical and community-based preventive measures. Here we review the most prominent of these analyses: Milken Institute\u2019s study, An Unhealthy America: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease, Charting a New Course (DeVol et al", "Both Sassi and colleagues and Carter and colleagues report on models encompassing a wide range of clinical and community-based interventions that address obesity. The OECD working paper (Sassi et al., 2009) assesses the efficiency and distributional impact of interventions to prevent chronic diseases associated with unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles. It employs the Chronic Disease Prevention model (CDP), a stochastic microsimulation model, jointly developed by the OECD and WHO. The model can be used to represent a variety of populations and their distinctive characteristics; this set of analyses represents the region of Europe and the costs represent average conditions across the countries making up the region. The CDP uses a causal web of behavioral risk factors for selected conditions", "As discussed further in Section 1.2, information from economic analyses that do make behavioral assumptions, including simulation models, are employed by federal actuaries who project the future costs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as they are by Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysts. Thus the kinds of information that actuaries make use of in their projections of program and legislative proposal costs are more varied than the technical discipline of actuarial science might suggest.\n1.2 Applications of economic analyses and models of preventive health interventions by public agencies and advisory groups, and in related policy contexts", "Recently the U.K. has given greater attention to the cost-effectiveness of public health interventions and surveyed a number of reviews of their economic impact. A group based at the University of York, the Public Health Research Consortium, identified several methodological challenges for evaluating the economic impact of public health interventions: attribution of effects, because of the paucity of controlled trials in public health interventions and the short duration of studies; measuring and valuing outcomes; identifying intersectoral costs and consequences; and incorporating equity considerations (Weatherly et al., 2009). The Consortium\u2019s study of the published reviews and their underlying studies noted that \u201cThe existing empirical literature is very disappointing, offering few insights on how to respond to these challenges\u2026there is an urgent need both for pilot studies and more methodological research. (p. 92)\u201d", ". The current USPSTF policy is that the Task Force does not consider economic costs in making recommendation but does \u201csearch for evidence of the costs and cost-effectiveness of implementation, presenting this information separately from its recommendation\u201d (USPSTF, 2008).", "CEA can account for the desirable effects of a health intervention in terms of natural units such as cases of disease averted or years of life gained, or in terms of synthetic measures that combine effects on morbidity and mortality such as health-adjusted life years (HALYs\u2014the general term for metrics such as quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, and disability-adjusted life years, DALYs). In CEA, the costs of each option are divided by the effect measure to determine the cost per \u201cunit\u201d of benefit provided.", "One of the outcomes of the expert panel meeting was a general acknowledgment of the need for simple tools, criteria, questions, and metrics for the audiences of models to employ in evaluating the models. Despite the various perspectives and traditions followed by different modelers, a common set of standards by which to communicate assumptions and methods would improve transparency and understanding.\nThe following are more specific issues that the expert panel considered:", "In efforts to improve and standardize economic analyses and modeling, a number of preventive services advisory groups led efforts in the early 2000s to provide guidance and standards for the inclusion of economic analyses and modeling into effectiveness studies. Since then\u2014in part due to these focused guidances and standards, as well as the increasing convergence in assumptions and modeling following the release of the influential PCEHM\u2019s reference case recommendation in 1996\u2014preventive services economic analyses and models have vastly improved. Most preventive services advisory groups now include economic analyses in their reviews, and many have formal processes for abstracting economic data, assessing the quality and results of the studies, and incorporating cost effectiveness into their decision making process. Standards have continued to advance, with insufficient data being the more limiting factor.", "In its economic simulation models to project the impact of legislative changes, CBO uses the most likely assumptions about the behavioral responses of households, businesses, federal regulators, and other levels of government. In addition to reviewing historical data for federal programs, data available from state programs, and conducting its own research with administrative records and survey data, CBO reviews studies conducted by others, and consults with researchers, agency officials, and businesses and interest groups. The most persuasive studies are:\n\u25a0 Critical reviews of the literature that assess the strength of evidence;\n\u25a0 Experiments and demonstrations with random assignment that address causal mechanisms; and\n\u25a0 Linked administrative and survey data to assess behavioral responses and socio-demographic impacts of policy changes.\nCBO consults with formal panels of economic and health advisors, and studies and reports are reviewed by outside experts.", "Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Policy makers should realize that all prevention models are uncertain; their results are probabilistic, not deterministic. (This is true, although not obvious, even when model analyses have not been conducted in a probabilistic manner). Thus assessments of cost-effectiveness can only be stated as probabilities, not certainties, and are contingent upon the amount a policy maker is willing to pay for given preventive benefit.\nThe results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses can be used to create cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC), which summarize the probability that each scenario under consideration is the most cost effective given different values of willingness to pay (WTP) for the benefit. CEACs are constructed by comparing the net health benefit of each intervention, for every simulated iteration, at each value of willingness to pay. The net benefit is equal to:\nNet BenefitRiR = BenefitRiR \u2219 WTP \u2013 CostRiR \u2026 (3.1.3)", "This section presents and discusses economic evaluations grouped according to four health conditions or service type. Because for this project it was not possible to review the literature on preventive services models comprehensively, we limited the search to topics of current policy relevance for which a number of recent economic analyses had been conducted. After reviewing the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the Community Preventive Services Task Force\u2014and reviewing our preliminary choices with ASPE\u2014we selected screening mammography to prevent breast cancer; immunization to prevent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection; prevention and management of diabetes; and clinical and community-based interventions to prevent obesity", "State-transition models are better equipped to manage the mathematical calculations of complex diseases with chronic durations. The Markovian assumption that transitions from the present state are independent of past or future states enhances the model\u2019s ability to manage complexity, but is not necessary to develop flexible state-transition models. Models may combine states that are memory-less with other state transitions that depend on values obtained earlier in the model, although this makes programming more complex. For example, in a model of diabetic retinopathy progression, Rein and colleagues (2011) combined primarily Markovian transitions with a transition to vision-threatening states that was calculated as a function of past duration of diabetes and 14 year average hemoglobin A1c values.", "Department of Transportation (DOT).

Unique solutions are represented by pathways from the initiation of the decision through its final consequence. A basic decision trees consist of outcome states, choice points between state alternatives, and terminal solutions. Costs are assigned to each state and probabilities are assigned to each choice point. The expected value of each terminal solution is then estimated as the sum of the products of each probability, multiplied by each cost on the path to a given terminal solution. The expected value of costs and utilities from a given solution is equal to the sum of the expected values of all possible alternatives that stem from that decision.", ". Notable features of the model include using incremental units of Body Mass Index (BMI) rather than broad BMI categories to capture the impact of small changes; distinguishing short and longer term effectiveness by separately calculating the first and subsequent year weight losses from baseline (assuming some regression to baseline after the first year); and allowing for first-year or capital investment costs to be input separately from subsequent year operating costs.

This demands a large amount of data for estimation. Furthermore, microsimulation does not allow for interactions among individuals nor can it reflect proximity or separation, as can agent-based models.", "Policy makers should evaluate which parameters were selected for inclusion in the univariate sensitivity analysis and the range of the values considered in the analysis.

The purpose of the section is to inform policy makers about different modeling options so that they can understand the implications of different modeling choices.\nModel Types. Several different model types can be employed across a variety of model structures. Kim and colleagues (2008) classify models in terms of four distinct dimensions: (1) the ability of individuals in the model to interact (static versus dynamic); (2) the ability of new individuals to enter the model as the time steps of the model progresses (open versus closed); (3) whether population averages are used or the model tracks individual actions (aggregate versus individual-based); and (4) whether model transitions are variable or fixed (stochastic versus deterministic).", "For example, Figure 5 displays the probability that each of four screening options is the most cost-effective given a range of WTP values per incremental QALY gained (Rein et al., forthcoming). The far left of the figure represents a policy maker who is willing to pay nothing per incremental QALY gained. At that value (WTP=$0), 100 percent of this model\u2019s simulations determined that no screening was the most cost-effective alternative. Progressing rightward on the x axis, the WTP increases and the probability that no screening is most cost-effective decreases. At a WTP value of $16,000 per QALY saved, birth-cohort screening with standard treatment becomes the option most likely to be cost-effective", ". Next, they examine costs and benefits from a societal perspective, considering the financial impacts on various parties in Washington State. The third step is a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis of the estimated net benefits. WSIPP analysts present legislative decision makers with a graphical display of the likelihood that the net benefits of a policy will be greater than zero under a variety of assumptions. For example, Figure 1 displays the distribution of potential outcomes for a given policy option, demonstrating that, given the model assumptions employed, the likelihood of a positive net benefit from the policy (measured as net present value), is 75%.", "McKay, M.D., Morrison, J.D., and Upton, S.C.

In contrast, a comprehensive state-transition Markov model (the CDC Measurement of the Value of Exercise (MOVE) Model) that encompassed seven community-based physical activity interventions and included five disease outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, estimated a cost-effectiveness ratio of $46,914/QALY for a 1-year individually adapted intensive lifestyle modification for persons at high risk of developing diabetes over a lifetime (Roux et al., 2008). Two studies (Bertram et al., 2010; Herman et al., 2005) reported the cost-effectiveness of drug and lifestyle interventions (compared with no intervention) over a lifetime.

For example, chronic diseases can take decades to manifest and prevention interventions consequently take decades to generate savings. While the modeling conventions of organizations like CBO and CMS\u2019s Office of the Actuary work well to help congressional and administration decision makers choose between most policy options, often they do not capture the natural history of a chronic disease, changes in quality of life, or spending and savings beyond the first ten years.", "Figure 6 illustrates a simple Markov survival model in which state 1 represents life and state 2 represents death. Individuals in the model experience an annual probability of remaining alive, represented by the curved arrow p1,1, and an annual probability of dying, represented by the straight arrow p1,2. The common notation used for p1,1 and p1,2 is read as the probability of starting in state 1 at the beginning of the time step and ending in state 1 at the end of the time step, and the probability of starting in state 1 at the beginning of the time step and ending in state 2 at the end of the time step.

Because of this, policy makers should be certain to consider whether the comparator scenario or scenarios used in the analysis appropriately fit the policy context to which the results will be applied.\nWhile many older studies utilized a no intervention scenario as their comparator, a more realistic comparator is some form of estimate of the services the model\u2019s target population would be expected to use in the absence of an intervention. For example, in a recent paper evaluating the cost-effectiveness of dilated fundus examinations of persons newly enrolling in Medicare at age 65, the authors compared the intervention scenario to a comparator of usual care, where usual care was the estimated annual probability of a dilated fundus examination of current Medicare recipients (Rein et al., 2012).", "Obesity control measures include a one-cent tax per 12 oz. of sweetened soft drinks, with 10 percent of the revenues from the tax granted to states for obesity reduction programs, contingent on state enforcement of bans in the use of trans fats by restaurants and sweetened beverages in schools, and nutrition posting by chain restaurants. The model projected the national trend in the growth of obesity rates from 1998 to 2005 forward, used an estimate from the literature on the proportion of health expenditures due to obesity of 6.25 percent, and then assumed that the obesity control provisions would slow the growth of the share of national health expenditures attributable to obesity to one half the historic rate (from 0.4 to 0.2 percent)", "The comparator. The cost-effectiveness of an intervention or new technology is a relative estimate which depends upon the scenario to which it is compared. A comparator (also known as the baseline or status quo) scenario is the counterfactual alternative situation whose costs and benefits are compared to the intervention or policy choice scenario in order to determine cost-effectiveness. In a cost-effectiveness analysis, a model is used to simulate the costs and benefits of intervention strategy and the comparator counterfactual situation, and then the incremental differences in costs and benefits are used to calculate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER).

The first estimate was consider the official score, but the set estimate provided decision makers with a more comprehensive analysis of the budgetary impact, if they decided to pass the reform legislation.

The effective use and implementation of a preventive health CBA framework is likely to require considerable investment of time and resources from state and federal government departments of health and treasury but has the potential to improve decision-making related to preventive health policies and programmes.\nBackground", "The Preventive Health CBA Framework is based on a review of the most relevant and contemporary Australian government CBA and other health economic evaluation guidance documents, and the published literature. As with all frameworks and guidelines, the Framework will need to be tested extensively, periodically reviewed and refined . The instantaneous change of evaluation practice to use a CBA framework for preventive health interventions is unrealistic, and there are several hurdles. Firstly, Australian governments need to accept a CBA framework for the assessment of preventive health interventions as complementary to traditional CUA/CEA methods for health-related economic appraisals. Secondly, there needs to be commitment from health departments to embed the use of economic evidence in decision-making and to invest in capacity-building so that the Framework can be trialled across various policies", "Document identification", "All CBA guidelines acknowledge that the equity objective of government intervention is not the primary goal of CBA and should not be incorporated into the technical NPV or BCR results. However, all CBA guidelines report that the distributional impact of the proposed policies should be considered in the decision-making process. PM&C , NSW Treasury  and Transport for NSW  recommend the use of distributional analysis to supplement the CBA results in order to demonstrate to decision-makers the winners and losers of a programme; however, the application of distributional weights is not recommended.

Data extraction involved JA initially extracting data on five documents and then presenting the initial data categories and results to RC and MM. The data extraction template was refined and used by JA to complete data extraction. Following data extraction, an analytical review was undertaken by JA to ascertain the similarities and differences between the recommended CBA methodology across the different departments and agencies, specifically those that impact economic analyses of preventive health policies and interventions. The assessment of CBA components that have relatively good agreement, poor agreement and flexibility in application involved a deliberative process with all authors until consensus was reached.\nDevelopment of a reference case for preventive health interventions", "CBA guidance documents often make a distinction between risk and uncertainty . \u201cRisk\u201d is often described as a parameter with known variability, and therefore the probability of alternative outcomes can be estimated, whereas \u201cuncertainty\u201d describes more vague assumptions and unknown outcomes in the future. The Handbook of CBA  notes that in practice, the distinction is subtle. Often in health intervention modelling, the range of possible values for variables that are accurately measurable (risk of disease, response rates, etc.) and more vague assumptions (e.g. based on expert opinion) are all incorporated in multi-way uncertainty analyses to predict the range of possible outcomes . This means that although current practice for CBA and health-related CUA/CEA is similar, using the term \u201cuncertainty analysis\u201d may indicate less accurate parameter estimates compared to the term \u201crisk assessment\u201d", "Despite CBA being closely aligned to orthodox welfarist theoretical foundations where individual utility is the \u201cmaximand\u201d (the thing to be maximized), this framework avoids the debate related to the appropriate normative foundation [welfarism or extra-welfarism (where health is the maximand)] for preventive health economic evaluations. We use the decision-making approach, , which allows the development of a framework that is theoretically meaningful whilst flexible enough to broaden the concept of benefit (to capture the range of impacts relevant to preventive health decision-making .

Participants were asked to identify relevant documents that may assist in the development of a CBA framework for preventive health interventions. These documents complemented the website search.\nData extraction and analysis", ". Given the lack of theoretical and methodological clarity, the Framework recommendation is based on the argument that the current discount rates endorsed by Australian governments are too high and are based on historical values, and therefore a lower rate of 3% used in preventive health intervention evaluations is recommended. The basis for variations in the discount rate across Australian jurisdictions is unfounded and therefore clearly an area for further research and consensus-building across all governments in Australia. The federal government should take leadership on this and investigate and update the recommended discount rate on a regular basis .", "The need to comply with varying evaluation conventions is not a unique feature of health interventions, with analyses across different contexts being associated with different CBA communities of practice . It is important that the audience for the analysis is carefully considered, as the use of multiple frameworks may be a source of confusion for politicians and bureaucrats alike , and may diminish their impact.", ".

There is also a need for economic analyses to move easily from a CBA framework to a CEA/CUA framework so that preventive health interventions are comparable with other evaluations in the health sector.", "The specifications of the reference case were based on the following considerations: (1) applied economic evaluation theory; (2) consistency between CBA across different NSW government departments; (3) the ease of moving from a CBA to a more conventional CEA/CUA framework used for health interventions, including consistency of decision context; (4) the practicalities of application by busy bureaucrats; and (5) the needs of end users, being both the Cabinet and decision-makers within health departments .", "Department of Economic Development Jobs Transport and Resources: Guidance on the development of options.

To be consistent with Treasury guidance  while still keeping the number of options tractable, it is recommended that health strategy documents underpin option selection . A manageable list of options should be assessed, potentially using multi-criteria analysis (MCA) as recommended by Infrastructure Australia . MCA can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively assess how well each of the options meets specific criteria.

The intersectoral nature of preventive health interventions also increases the likelihood that Cabinet approval is required prior to implementation . Prevention interventions are also often \u201ccomplex\u201d, with various health impacts across the population and spillover effects into other sectors . For example, active transport policies require action from the transport sector and produce health benefits by increasing physical activity levels of individuals and environmental benefits from reduced reliance on private vehicles . These features result in the current methods for healthcare economic evaluation, largely developed based on the medical model of healthcare, posing methodological challenges when used to evaluate preventive health interventions and policies", "The use of a CBA framework for policy appraisal is likely to be particularly useful for Cabinet decision-making, for several reasons. Firstly, CBA is the most common tool for policy appraisal across various sectors, such as transport and the environment  and given that the Cabinet consists of government ministers from diverse sectors, an evaluation framework that is familiar to Cabinet members may assist decision-making. Secondly, when allocating resources across sectors, trade-offs need to be made, and hence appraisals across sectors need to be consistent and comparable . CBA is considered the only economic analysis technique that allows the assessment and valid comparison of interventions across sectors .

It is recommended that the friction cost approach (FCA), which estimates short-term productivity losses incurred by employers in replacing a lost worker , be used to estimate the productivity impacts. Using highly individualized data to estimate productivity impacts may have adverse equity impacts , and therefore average gender-free wage rates should be used. Optional additional analyses using more individualized data could be undertaken; however, a full discussion of the distributional impact of the analyses should be included.", "The discount rate used in economic analyses is an important topic that remains hotly debated nationally and internationally, with little consensus amongst academics and government departments . Key topics of debate include whether the basis of the discount rate for public policy appraisals should be the opportunity cost of capital, the social rate of time preference, or variations/combinations of the two . There is also little consensus on how to calculate the actual discount rate to be used and whether the rate should vary over time, by sector or by level of project risk, and whether it should incorporate equity considerations for future generations . Despite the lack of consensus, the choice of discount rate remains particularly important for preventive health interventions, where the benefits may only be realized many years into the future ", "Health and safety are often given as examples of impacts that are difficult to forecast .

It has been argued that, rather than a standard discount rate for all publicly funded projects, the discount rate should vary according to the project\u2019s systematic risk (a project has low systematic risk if it yields consistent returns regardless of changes in the economy as a whole) . Preventive health investments are likely to have low systematic risks, and a discount rate of 3.5% for projects with very low systematic risk has been recommended . Several health economists assert that health is a unique commodity, and the consumption value of health grows as income increases over time, and therefore a discount rate lower than the social rate of time preference should be used for the evaluation of health interventions ", "All guidance documents emphasize the importance of testing the impact of key assumptions and variables in sensitivity analyses. Various governments\u2019 guidance documents  suggest that one-way sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses (including best/worst-case analysis) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (using Monte Carlo simulations) are appropriate methods to quantify the variability in the results.

This will allow the assessment of the specifications for the primary analysis and sensitivity analyses in terms of their ability to accurately assess the credentials of preventive health interventions. The use of the Framework will facilitate the development of empirical evidence that can be used in future evaluations. Thirdly, the acceptance and use of the Framework will also require treasury departments to better understand the unique features of preventive health interventions and to accept the deviations away from the current treasury guidance. This process is likely to be time- and resource-intensive for both health and treasury departments and will require a close and effective working relationship between them. Despite the large commitment required, governments are gradually moving towards mandated CBA processes , and therefore the health sector must adapt so that preventive health analyses are useful to both central and sector-specific decision-making.", ". The key methodological challenges relate to the difficulty in establishing the efficacy of interventions where randomized controlled studies are not feasible, the effects of interventions emerging many years into the future\u2014beyond the duration of conventional studies, additional effects not readily captured by health-related quality of life measures and spillover effects on other sectors . Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) are the techniques predominantly used in the health sector; however, they do not adequately capture all the relevant costs and benefits of prevention policies .

CBA is likely to be useful when evaluating preventive health interventions that are often cross-sectoral in nature and require Cabinet approval prior to implementation. This study outlines a CBA framework for the evaluation of preventive health interventions that balances the need for consistency with other agency guidelines whilst adhering to guidelines and conventions for health economic evaluations.\nMethods", ". Despite this change in focus, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)  continues to recommend a healthcare system perspective, with all impacts not related to health or the provision of healthcare excluded in the primary analysis, though additional analyses using a societal perspective can be included in the submission. Consistent with PBAC guidance, the NSW Health Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence  acknowledges that it would be ideal to adopt a societal perspective in economic evaluations, but reports a health sector perspective as the most commonly used. It suggests that alternative perspectives could be used for secondary analyses (whole-of-government, societal).", "Revealed preference (RP), stated preference (SP) and benefit transfer are commonly reported techniques used to value non-market impacts. NSW Treasury  and PM&C  report that RP techniques are preferred to SP techniques, whilst other guidelines do not report a preference. Within the health sector, the monetary valuation of health is a contentious issue , but it is unavoidable when conducting a CBA or for decision-making when trade-offs between health and other outcomes are considered. The value of a statistical life (VSL) and the value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) are often recommended as appropriate methods to value health and safety benefits; however, the actual value of these parameters differs between guidelines. PM&C  provides an estimate of the VSL and VSLY based on a review of the international literature in 2008 .

The NSW Health Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence  reports that one rationale for discounting is the social rate of time preference. It emphasizes that population health programme evaluations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate. Federally funded transport projects are required to conduct CBA using the rate recommended by Infrastructure Australia (7% for primary analysis and 4% and 10% for sensitivity analyses) . The Transport for NSW  guidance states that for projects with long lives, the narrative around the results should highlight the appropriateness of lower discount rates.", "Economic analysis involves a comparative assessment; however, the definition of the comparator depends on the question being addressed . For government decision-making, the question generally is, \u201cIs the state of the world with the programme better than the state of the world without the programme?\u201d In line with this question, all guidelines define the comparator as the \u201cstatus quo\u201d. All guidelines emphasize the importance of defining an appropriate comparator and warn against the use of a \u201cstraw man\u201d comparator that may not accurately capture the credentials of the proposed policy . There are differences in terminology used in CBA guidance and health sector guidance. CBA guidance  refers to the comparator as the \u201cbase case\u201d, whilst the health-based guidelines (PBAC  and the NSW Health Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence ) use the term \u201ccomparator\u201d. PBAC  uses the term \u201cbase case\u201d to refer to the primary analysis.", ". However, there are some discrepancies, with Transport for NSW  reporting that the discount rate is based on the social rate of time preference rather than the opportunity cost of capital, and NSW Planning, Industry and Environment  recommending a rate of 4% in sensitivity analyses.", ". The VSL used by Transport for NSW  is based on two SP studies and is 70% higher than the value used by NSW Health Infrastructure. The use of varied VSL and VSLY values in analyses across sectors and across jurisdictions may result in inconsistent decision-making, and therefore efforts to update and harmonize these values should be prioritized.", "Economic theory suggests that the appropriate time horizon is the economic life of the project and should be long enough to capture important differences in costs and benefits between options and the base case (comparator) . This is acknowledged by all the guidance documents; however, several acknowledge the uncertainty involved in forecasting over extended periods . NSW Treasury  states that time horizons longer than 20\u201330 years need to be discussed with the Treasury department prior to line agencies conducting ex ante analyses. Based on Treasury  guidance, NSW Health Infrastructure  has set a time horizon of 20 years for all evaluations, while Transport for NSW  report that longer time horizons (up to 50 years) may be appropriate; however, the plausibility of data and assumptions are required to be verified with the Transport for NSW Evaluation and Assurance team", "Given that preventive health decision-making is largely under the jurisdiction of state governments, the NSW State Government was used as an example for the development of the preventive health CBA framework. The NSW Government has been a leader in the use of economic evidence in decision-making and was the first state government in Australia to mandate the use of CBA, initially for new capital projects, and more recently with increased focus on using economic evidence in decision-making across all departments . Within the NSW Government context, preventive health interventions that require new funding or impact various sectors often require Cabinet approval. This process involves the submission of a business case (which includes a CBA) to the NSW Treasury, who then informs the Cabinet Committee and the Cabinet Standing Committee on Expenditure Review ", "The titles and short descriptions of 5234 website documents were screened, and an additional six documents were identified by NSW Health and Treasury staff (document search flowchart reported in Additional file 2). Full-text review was completed for 39 government documents (26 federal government and 13 NSW state government documents). Nine documents provided CBA or relevant economic evaluation guidance . An overview of these nine guidance documents is reported in Table 2. Details of the perspective, comparator, specifications of the options for appraisal, time horizon and discount rate reported in these guidance documents are provided in Table 3. Table 4 provides an overview of guidance related to the costs and benefits that should be included or excluded, valuation of non-market benefits, key decision rules, sensitivity analyses and other key considerations in decision-making", "We analysed CBA and other evaluation guidance documents published by Australian federal and New South Wales (NSW) government departments. Data extraction compared the recommendations made by different agencies and the impact on the analysis of preventive health interventions. The framework specifies a reference case and sensitivity analyses based on the following considerations: (1) applied economic evaluation theory; (2) consistency between CBA across different government departments; (3) the ease of moving from a CBA to a more conventional cost-effectiveness/cost-utility analysis framework often used for health interventions; (4) the practicalities of application; and (5) the needs of end users being both Cabinet decision-makers and health policy-makers.\nResults", "When considering applied economic evaluation theory in relation to a CBA framework for preventive health, there is no authoritative textbook. The reference case draws from the handbook on CBA published by the Australian government  and the textbook that outlines the recommendations made by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine , supplemented by key academic references related to specific topics. The impact of the various methodological specifications on the credentials of preventive health interventions are highlighted and used to inform the reference case and the recommended sensitivity analyses. Given that the NSW Treasury CBA guidance is the primary guidance document for CBA within the NSW government, when there was a conflict between guidelines, NSW Treasury guidance was used predominantly as the basis of the reference case.", ". It reports that there are equity implications in including productivity and potential issues with double-counting of benefits related to the valuation of health-related quality of life. Although evidence suggests that quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) generally do not capture productivity impacts , individuals surveyed to estimate the VSL and VSLY may consider personal income impacts when answering the survey questions; therefore, when using the VSL/VSLY, the inclusion of productivity impacts on individuals may involve issues of double-counting.", "Valid comparisons between policies presented to the Cabinet at different times is possible only if there is sufficient standardization of CBA evaluation methodology and decision rules for policy approval . However, any framework must have the flexibility to capture the credentials of interventions across a range of sectors. For example, New South Wales (NSW) Treasury guidelines report that CBA should take a NSW community perspective . This may be appropriate for most analyses, but health interventions that result in cost-shifting to federally funded health services could appear more favourable than if a national perspective were taken. Therefore, the desire for harmonization of methodologies needs to be balanced with the need for adequate flexibility to allow robust analyses of specific policies .", "Australian governments are committed to using economic evidence in the form of CBA to aid decision-making . Given that preventive health interventions are often cross-sectoral and require Cabinet approval, a CBA framework may be required for decision-making. The Preventive Health CBA Framework is a set of recommendations for the economic appraisal of preventive health interventions to aid government decision-making. The need for these CBA guidelines is a result of the challenges associated with accurately assessing the credentials of preventive health interventions using conventional CUA/CEA frameworks or current CBA guidelines. Frameworks and guidelines can enhance the replicability, comparability, credibility and usability of CBA results ; however, it is recommended that practice guidelines are not viewed as requirements that the analyst must apply indiscriminately.", "The Framework balances the need for consistency with central guidelines, while incorporating the unique features of prevention interventions by defining a reference case for Cabinet submissions and additional sensitivity analyses. This allows the analyst to demonstrate the impact of key parameters, such as the time horizon or the discount rate, on the economic credentials of prevention interventions. To inform resource allocation decision-making within the health sector, it is important that preventive health policy analyses are comparable with other health interventions assessed using a CUA or CEA framework. This will allow the assessment of the value for money of interventions across the spectrum of health interventions from primary prevention and secondary prevention through to treatment", ". Further dialogue amongst the public and decision-makers related to whose values should count (individuals affected by intervention, the general population, third-party experts or decisions-makers) for government resource allocation decision-making is required. All CBA guidelines reviewed recommended that the distribution of impacts be presented alongside the technical CBA results . Further research is required to better understand how these impacts are considered in decision-making and the methods to better assist decision-makers in using distributional analyses that accompany CBA .", "Availability of data and materials\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article and its Additional information files.\nAbbreviations\n- BCR:\n-\nBenefit\u2013cost ratio\n- CBA:\n-\nCost\u2013benefit analysis\n- CEA:\n-\nCost-effectiveness analysis\n- COAG:\n-\nCouncil of Australian Governments\n- CUA:\n-\nCost-utility analysis\n- DALYs:\n-\nDisability-adjusted life-years\n- FCA:\n-\nFriction cost approach\n- ICER:\n-\nIncremental cost-effectiveness ratio\n- LGA:\n-\nLocal government area\n- MCA:\n-\nMulti-criteria analysis\n- NPV:\n-\nNet present value\n- NSW:\n-\nNew South Wales\n- OBPR:\n-\nOffice of Best Practice Regulation\n- PBAC:\n-\nPharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee\n- PBS:\n-\nPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme\n- PM&C:\n-\nPrime Minister and Cabinet\n- QALYs:\n-\nQuality-adjusted life-years\n- RP:\n-\nRevealed preference\n- SP:\n-\nStated preference\n- VSL:\n-\nValue of a statistical life\n- VSLY:\n-\nValue of a statistical life-year\n- WACC:\n-\nWeighted average cost of capital\n- WEB:\n-", ". It states that the discount rate should remain stable over the analysis period and that the impact of varying the discount rate should be tested in sensitivity analyses (using a rate of 3% and 10%). It further stipulates that project risk should be reflected in the quantification of the costs and benefits and not in the discount rate. This is largely consistent with the federal Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C)  guidance. However, in specific PM&C guidance related to environmental impacts , a declining long-term discount rate is recommended, which drops gradually from 5.4% for periods of analysis over 30 years, to 3.7% for periods over 301 years. NSW line agencies (Health Infrastructure , Transport for NSW  and NSW Planning, Industry and Environment ) guidance documents cite NSW Treasury  guidance", "Framework recommendation All input parameters, plausible distributions and sources should be clearly documented. More extensive sensitivity analyses should be undertaken for variables that are likely to have large impacts on the results and those based on less reliable data. It is recommended that the term \u201csensitivity analysis\u201d be used rather than \u201cuncertainty analysis\u201d. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (using Monte-Carlo simulations and bootstrapping techniques) should be undertaken to assess the range of likely BCR results given the variability in the input parameters. Given that there are many phrases in epidemiology that use the term \u201crisk\u201d (e.g., risk factors, relative risk, risk ratios), it is recommended that the phrase \u201crisk analysis\u201d not be used in health-related CBA.\nHow should equity, distributional impacts and other considerations be incorporated into the Preventive Health CBA Framework?", ". evidence of intervention effectiveness ) will increase the tractability of this task.", "The CBA framework for preventive health interventions is based on Australian federal and NSW Government department guidelines on economic evaluation and CBA. The included government departments are listed in Table 1. The government departments were selected based on their authority over economic evaluations for decision-making (e.g. federal and state central agencies) and the likelihood that the department had developed sector-specific CBA guidance that incorporates health impacts (e.g. Transport for NSW routinely uses CBA for the appraisal of policy proposals and includes health impacts in evaluations).

The key components of the discount rate based on the opportunity cost of capital is the risk-free rate of return and the market risk premium . The risk-free rate of return, which can be estimated from the 10-year Commonwealth bond rate, has steadily dropped from 6.8% in 1989, when the 7% discount rate was first established in Australia, to 0.8% in 2017 ", "To ensure efficient use of limited government resources, policy-makers need to consider the costs and benefits of proposed government action against key comparators.

Firstly, in addition to applying the CBA framework, the analyst needs to conduct high-quality analyses using sound applied economic evaluation concepts, theories and practices . Secondly, politicians engaged in the Cabinet process and bureaucrats supporting them need to understand CBA and value its contribution to the assessment of allocative efficiency. According to Dobes et al. 2016 , a cultural change in government where bureaucrats volitionally use and value CBA is needed and is likely to be more effective than mandated guidelines. This will require increased resources and expertise in the conduct of CBA within government departments .", "Using the NSW government as an example, the Framework reference case recommendations are largely consistent with the NSW Treasury CBA guidelines  to promote consistency in Cabinet decision-making. However, there are several inconsistencies and issues that need to be resolved to improve the comparability of CBA across various sectors. Firstly, parameters such as the VSL/VSLY that are key drivers of CBA results  should be the focus of parameter harmonization efforts. The Framework recommends using results from a recent systematic review ; however, this needs to be deliberated by the departments that currently use varying values. Developing a parameter database that is regularly updated may be an effective way to ensure consistency of parameter values; it may also assist analysts in incorporating intersectoral impacts into CBA.

Several economists have argued that current discount rates are too high, and have advocated for rates as low as 1.5% .

However, analysts should take care in the accounting of benefits resulting from the intervention. The decision to account for avoided costs on the cost or benefit side of the equation in a CBA will not impact the NPV results, but the BCR will differ. In CEA and CUA of health interventions, avoided costs resulting from the intervention are accounted for on the cost side of the equation. The Framework recommends using the conventions reported in several government guidance documents , where all impacts (including resource and health consequences) resulting from a project are counted as benefits, regardless of whether they are positive or negative , to ensure that BCRs are calculated consistently.\nHow should uncertainty be incorporated into the Preventive Health CBA Framework?", "Framework recommendation Health benefits stemming from prevention interventions should be quantified using an appropriate measure of health-related quality of life (DALY or QALY). This enables the translation of preventive health interventions from a CUA framework to a CBA framework. The health benefit can then be valued using the VSLY using a value of A$ 303,531 in the primary analysis and a high value of A$ 315,732 and low value of A$ 88,136 (in 2017 values). For sensitivity analyses using the health sector perspective, a wide range of QALY/DALY values should be used. The DALY and QALY quantify both morbidity and mortality impacts of interventions; however, given that the VSLY is estimated from the VSL, it may only be relevant to the mortality component of health interventions.

NSW Health Infrastructure  reports that these impacts can be reported qualitatively. Transport for NSW  does not provide any guidance on the inclusion of productivity in CBA associated with the health impacts of transport interventions. The PBAC  (using a healthcare system perspective) recommends that the primary analysis exclude productivity impacts, but these may be included in supplementary analyses", "CBA is a tool used to inform decisions related to allocative efficiency, given a particular distribution of income in a society. CBA does not provide any judgement on whether the current distribution of income is equitable, and in fact, is biased in favour of the existing distribution . From a welfare economics tradition, CBA guidelines  specify that outcomes should be valued based on the preferences of the individuals or the firms that experience the outcomes. However, this may bias outcomes against those who have a lower ability to pay . From an extra-welfarist perspective, where the focus is on health outcomes, the PBAC  recommends that the scoring algorithm used to value health states (to calculate QALYs) be based on representative Australian preference weights.

When communicating the results to a health sector audience, the various meanings of these terms should be defined.\nDiscussion", "All reviewed guidance documents recommend that all critical assumptions and inputs are reported with supporting evidence where available .

PM&C  recommends presenting costs and benefits in three categories: monetized, quantified but not monetized, and qualitative but not quantified or monetized.

Logic models should be developed to identify all potential impacts (economic, social and environmental) of the preventive health intervention.

Secondly, discrepancies in typology can cause confusion, particularly when communicating results to varied audiences.

The two most common approaches for estimating the discount rate are based on the opportunity cost of capital and the social rate of time preference. The social rate of time preference can be estimated from the rate of return of long-term government bonds; however, the opportunity cost of capital cannot be measured directly, and empirical estimations are likely to be subject to measurement error .

Accessed October 18, 2018.", "As the participants in our study offered their perspectives on the barriers and influences surrounding the coverage and delivery of preventive care services, much of the conversation focused on the influence of financial considerations on uptake of preventive care. However, participants generally agreed that financial incentives alone are unlikely to result in positive changes in the absence of a multipronged approach to increasing preventive services among people at risk of or living with chronic diseases. A multipronged approach would include strong organizational leadership, shifts in institutional culture, team-based care, systems of care that accommodate preventive services, and willingness of patients to seek out and engage in preventive care.\nAcknowledgments", "Although primary prevention was not excluded, much of the discussion focused on secondary and tertiary prevention related to health care system interventions and community interventions linked to clinical services. Throughout the interviews, the participants were encouraged to draw from their experiences with organizations of various capacities and not to focus only on high-level performers or models that would be difficult for average organizations to adopt and replicate. Each interview was conducted via teleconference and facilitated by the first author (S.L.), a senior scientist with expertise in qualitative research methods.\nInterview Findings\nAcross all interviews, 4 findings emerged as major levers or influencers of preventive care. These findings cut across all health care industry sectors and organization types.", "Clinical preventive strategies are available for many chronic diseases; these strategies include intervening before disease occurs (primary prevention), detecting and treating disease at an early stage (secondary prevention), and managing disease to slow or stop its progression (tertiary prevention). These interventions, combined with lifestyle changes, can substantially reduce the incidence of chronic disease and the disability and death associated with chronic disease (9). However, clinical preventive services are substantially underutilized despite the human and economic burden of chronic diseases, the availability of evidence-based tools to prevent or ameliorate them, and the effectiveness of prevention strategies (9\u201311). For example, in 2015, only 8% of US adults aged 35 or older received all recommended, high-priority, appropriate clinical preventive services, and nearly 5% received none (12).\nInterview Study", "Chronic diseases are also the leading drivers of health care costs in the United States (2). In 2016, total direct costs for health care treatment of chronic diseases were more than $1 trillion, with diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and osteoarthritis being the most expensive (2,7). If lost economic productivity is also considered, the total cost of chronic diseases increases to $3.7 trillion, which is close to one-fifth of the entire US economy (7,8). These costs are expected to increase as the population ages \u2014 projections indicate that by 2030, more than 80 million people in the United States will have at least 3 chronic diseases (7).", "Chronic diseases can profoundly reduce quality of life for patients and for their families, affecting enjoyment of life, family relationships, and finances (5). Working can be difficult for people with chronic diseases: rates of absenteeism are higher and income is often lower among people who have a chronic disease compared with people who do not have one. Functional limitations can be distressing, and depression, which can reduce a patient\u2019s ability to cope with pain and worsen the clinical course of disease, is a common complication (6).", "Rapid changes in health care reimbursement models. The fourth finding focused on the pace of change in health care reimbursement models. The shift from volume-based reimbursement has been at the forefront of debate and discussion for years, but for typical health care delivery organizations, the transition to value-based reimbursement is still in early stages and is uneven across payers. As a result, the transition has not reached the \u201ctipping point\u201d for providers to change their practice patterns. As one interviewee observed, \u201cThere is some emphasis on value-based care, including focus on outcomes and reduced spending, but the view is generally short-term.\u201d The health care industry will continue to move in the direction of value-based care, but changes in provider practice vary across systems and markets. There is also considerable room for continuing experimentation and evaluation to determine what reimbursement models work best and for whom.\nDiscussion", "Use of metrics to drive change in the health care system. The second finding was related to metrics and the importance of using metrics to drive change in the health care system. Interviewees stressed that measures continue to play a crucial role in the delivery of care, but the \u201cright\u201d metrics \u2014 outcome-focused, aligned across payers, and with sufficient financial incentives or risk \u2014 are needed to drive uptake of chronic disease preventive services. One participant, emphasizing that reporting and monitoring can drive change, noted, \u201cOnce external reporting is in place, measured outcomes are prioritized.\u201d However, interviewees cautioned about the \u201cmetrics fatigue\u201d that is plaguing health care providers, the misalignment of measures for reporting and quality ratings, and the current lack of financial risk for outcome measures associated with preventive care; in other words, payments to providers are not based on improvements in their patients\u2019 health status.", "Industry experts participating in this stakeholder interview process made it clear that most players in the health care system are aware of recommended preventive care services and understand the benefit of preventing disease for the patient and the larger health care system. Underutilization of preventive services is largely the result of an implementation gap rather than an information gap; in other words, providers do not prioritize preventive care services although they know that preventive services can reduce the incidence and burden of chronic diseases. A major reason the implementation gap exists is that financial incentives do not align with a focus on preventing chronic diseases. Currently, most providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid to treat rather than to prevent disease", "Increasing uptake of preventive services requires multifaceted strategies, including but not limited to organizational leadership, education, measurement, and reimbursement. With this in mind, we developed an interview guide (Table 2), which included a series of questions focused on how payers, health systems, and physicians determine their clinical and business priorities for resource allocation and quality improvement efforts. We asked about opportunities to include incentives for the use of preventive services under current and emerging designs of models for payment and delivery. We included questions about examples of successful implementation of preventive services strategies or models and about clinical\u2013community linkages that focus on chronic disease prevention.", "Financial and economic considerations. The most prominent theme was finances. All interviewees highlighted the importance of financial and economic considerations when organizations determine priorities and make decisions. These decisions include where to invest resources, what health benefits to cover, or how to bill for clinical services. In the words of one interviewee, \u201cWith no margin, there is no mission.\u201d", "Chronic diseases are a tremendous burden to both patients and the health care system. In 2014, 60% of adult Americans had at least one chronic disease or condition, and 42% had multiple diseases (1). Chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic kidney disease, are the leading causes of poor health, long-term disability, and death in the United States (2,3). One-third of all deaths in this country are attributable to heart disease or stroke, and every year, more than 1.7 million people receive a diagnosis of cancer (2). During the past several decades, the prevalence of diabetes increased dramatically; in 2015 more than 29 million Americans had diabetes and another 86 million adults had prediabetes, increasing their chance of developing type 2 diabetes (3)", "No financial support was received for this essay.
