At last we can begin to study the genetic basis of human cognition and, hence, language. Three examples of ongoing research are described here.\nLanguage processing", "Science historians are familiar with the power of new technologies to revolutionize science. We are standing before an advance that will feel particularly close to home. Over the next decade or so, we can expect new genomics technologies to further our understanding of one quintessential aspect of being human: language.\nThe languages of the world, which form part of and are the main bearers of cultures, are highly diverse. The capacity to develop, learn and use them, however, belongs to our shared genetic heritage. These aspects of language are researched intensively at the Max Planck Institutes for Psycholinguistics, Evolutionary Anthropology, and Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.", "Language and genetics\nGenetic methods have revolutionized research into many aspects of languages, including the tracing of their origins. Gene variants underlie individual language skills. Genetic predisposition might favour the evolution of structural features of languages.\nHumans have a unique natural ability to develop highly complex linguistic systems \u2014 an ability that lies in our genes but is also shaped by our different environments. We can learn languages from others and use them to share our thoughts, feelings and desires; languages are the foundation of society, culture and science.

The traditional methods of comparative historical linguistics, based primarily on similarities in vocabulary, can make sense of language evolution over only the past few thousand years at most.

In all, these findings suggest that bilingual language control is shaped by an individual's experience switching between languages and their inherent genome.", "snippets": ["Previous studies have debated whether the ability for bilinguals to mentally control their languages is a consequence of their experiences switching between languages or whether it is a specific, yet highly-adaptive, cognitive ability. The current study investigates how variations in the language-related gene FOXP2 and executive function-related genes COMT, BDNF, and Kibra/WWC1 affect bilingual language control during two phases of speech production, namely the language schema phase (i.e., the selection of one language or another) and lexical response phase (i.e., utterance of the target). Chinese-English bilinguals (N = 119) participated in a picture-naming task involving cued language switches. Statistical analyses showed that both genes significantly influenced language control on neural coding and behavioral performance. Specifically, FOXP2 rs1456031 showed a wide-ranging effect on language control, including RTs, F(2, 113) = 4.00, FDR p =", "Genetic bases of language control in bilinguals: Evidence from an EEG study\n- PMID: 37051723\n- PMCID: PMC10203802\n- DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26301\nGenetic bases of language control in bilinguals: Evidence from an EEG study\nAbstract", "Keywords: bilingualism; electroencephalogram; executive function; genes; language control.\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.
