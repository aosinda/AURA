How does this ability relate to other higher cognitive functions, like human memory and mathematical or musical ability? Until recently, it has been hard to even pose these questions. The past few years, however, have seen the rapid development of methods to analyse genes quickly and relatively cheaply. At last we can begin to study the genetic basis of human cognition and, hence, language. Three examples of ongoing research are described here.\nLanguage processing", "Science historians are familiar with the power of new technologies to revolutionize science. We are standing before an advance that will feel particularly close to home. Over the next decade or so, we can expect new genomics technologies to further our understanding of one quintessential aspect of being human: language.\nThe languages of the world, which form part of and are the main bearers of cultures, are highly diverse. The capacity to develop, learn and use them, however, belongs to our shared genetic heritage. These aspects of language are researched intensively at the Max Planck Institutes for Psycholinguistics, Evolutionary Anthropology, and Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.", "The human genome does not \u2018create\u2019 languages; however, it does direct the organization of the human brain and some peripheral organs that are prerequisites for the language system, and is probably responsible for the significant differences in language skills between individuals. At the extremes are people with extraordinary gifts for learning many languages and undertaking simultaneous interpretation, and people with severe congenital speech disorders.", "Language and genetics\nGenetic methods have revolutionized research into many aspects of languages, including the tracing of their origins. Gene variants underlie individual language skills. Genetic predisposition might favour the evolution of structural features of languages.\nHumans have a unique natural ability to develop highly complex linguistic systems \u2014 an ability that lies in our genes but is also shaped by our different environments. We can learn languages from others and use them to share our thoughts, feelings and desires; languages are the foundation of society, culture and science. So it is perhaps not suprising that all aspects of language \u2014 including structure, global distribution, acquisition, processing in the brain, role in thought and actions, and links with culture and education \u2014 can be considered to be important subjects of research.", "Exciting early results have identified a gene underlying one form of speech disorder known as verbal dyspraxia. This serious impairment is characterized by problems in articulation, along with other linguistic symptoms. Genetic studies of an English family with verbal dyspraxia have shown that the condition results from a mutation in the gene, known as FOXP2 (Fig. 1) \u2013 located on chromosome 7, which affects the language areas of the brain via several intermediate steps. Although this speech deficit is rare, it now seems that the same genetic mechanism could play a role in other, much more common congenital speech pathologies.", "The methods were developed and tested on a small well-researched subgroup of Austronesian languages and are now being applied to the much more complex relationships between the Papuan languages spoken in the same area. The results suggest that these languages derive from a common phylum that is much older than the Australian languages, which arrived in the area only 3,000 years ago.\nStructural differences\nLanguages are not inborn. There are approximately 7,000 languages in the world today, and learning any one of them is a lengthy process that takes around a decade. There is no reason why a Chinese child growing up in Germany should learn to speak German any worse than a German child or a child of any other nationality. A specific genetic predisposition, however, might influence the evolution of particular structural features of a language within a group of genetically similar individuals, for example whether the language is tonal or non-tonal.", "Another study is addressing the development and spread of languages over larger geographical areas. The traditional methods of comparative historical linguistics, based primarily on similarities in vocabulary, can make sense of language evolution over only the past few thousand years at most. The new project adapts the widely used methods of evolutionary genetics \u2014 namely, the construction of phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2) \u2014 with the phonological, morphological and syntactic features of language as raw data, primarily to study the sophisticated languages and peoples of Melanesia (an area covering most of the islands north and northeast of Australia).", "However, FOXP2 is not a \u2018language gene\u2019 \u2014 that is a term coined by the media. The same mutation also affects the liver for example, and the non-mutated gene is found in many other animals, such as the mouse, which do not speak. Rather, it is one of many genetic components important in the development of language ability. Nevertheless, its discovery was the first small breakthrough in understanding the genetic basis of human language.\nLanguage and populations\nAnthropologists believe that modern humans originated in Africa. Is there a link between the spread of languages and the genetic differences between the peoples who speak them?", "One study is examining the effect of contact between prehistoric populations with different sociocultural backgrounds in different locations, particularly Africa and Siberia, on language and genetics. The types of contact that occurred are unknown, so it is hard to assess their consequences using only linguistic methods. Molecular genetic analyses can help spot a bottleneck, or founder effect, that might indicate a mixing of different populations, or reveal discrepancies between genetic and language relationships indicative of recent language drift.", "Chinese is perhaps the most well-known of the tonal languages, in which a single syllable can convey different meanings according to whether it is spoken in a consistent tone or a rising, rising\u2013falling or falling tone. The distribution of tonal and non-tonal languages corresponds closely with the distribution of two alleles, or forms, of the abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) and microcephalin genes. Of course, alleles by themselves do not directly lead to the evolution and use of tonal languages; children with different forms of the genes will still be able to learn tonal languages. A particular genetic predisposition in a population, however, might favour the emergence of languages with particular structural characteristics. It is now possible to study whether there might also be a genetic predisposition to other structural properties, like poverty or richness of inflexion.", "Recent research using modern scientific methods has thrown up some surprises. One of the most interesting shows how genetic and linguistic classifications of populations can diverge. Most European languages belong to the Indo-European group. Two notable exceptions are Basque, which is relatively isolated, and the Finno-Ugric languages, in particular Finnish. Modern Finns have been found to be genetically close to Indo-Europeans, but genetically different from their Saami neighbours whose language is also Finno-Ugric."], "title": "Language and genetics | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft"}, "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32924135/": {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32924135/", "description": "Genetic factors contributing to many complex skills during mid-childhood and early adolescence, including literacy, verbal cognition and nonverbal cognition, originate developmentally in early-childhood and are captured by receptive vocabulary. ... 1 Language and Genetics Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The ...", "snippets": ["The developmental origins of genetic factors influencing language and literacy: Associations with early-childhood vocabulary\n- PMID: 32924135\n- DOI: 10.1111/jcpp.13327\nThe developmental origins of genetic factors influencing language and literacy: Associations with early-childhood vocabulary\nAbstract\nBackground: The heritability of language and literacy skills increases from early-childhood to adolescence.

They argued that categories like nouns and verbs are biologically, evolutionarily, and psychologically implausible and that the field called for an account that can explain the acquisition process without innate categories.\nResearchers started to suggest that instead of having a language-specific mechanism for language processing, children might utilize general cognitive and learning principles.", "It involves the acquisition of grammar, vocabulary, and communication skills through exposure, interaction, and cognitive development. This process typically occurs in childhood but can continue throughout life.\nWhat is Skinner\u2019s theory of language development?\nSkinner\u2019s theory of language development, also known as behaviorist theory, suggests that language is acquired through operant conditioning. According to Skinner, children learn language by imitating and being reinforced for correct responses.\nHe argued that language is a result of external stimuli and reinforcement, emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping linguistic behavior.\nWhat is Chomsky\u2019s theory of language acquisition?\nChomsky\u2019s theory of language acquisition, known as Universal Grammar, posits that language is an innate capacity of humans.", "After more than 60 years of research into child language development, the mechanism that enables children to segment syllables and words out of the strings of sounds they hear and to acquire grammar to understand and produce language is still quite an enigma.\nBehaviorist Theory of Language Acquisition\nOne of the earliest scientific explanations of language acquisition was provided by Skinner (1957). As one of the pioneers of behaviorism, he accounted for language development using environmental influence, through imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning.\nIn this view, children learn words and grammar primarily by mimicking the speech they hear and receiving positive feedback for correct usage.\nSkinner argued that children learn language based on behaviorist reinforcement principles by associating words with meanings. Correct utterances are positively reinforced when the child realizes the communicative value of words and phrases.", "Whereas researchers approaching the language acquisition problem from the perspective of Universal Grammar argue for early full productivity, i.e., early adult-like knowledge of the language, the opposing constructivist investigators argue for a more gradual developmental process. It is suggested that children are sensitive to patterns in language which enables the acquisition process.\nAn example of this gradual pattern learning is morphology acquisition. Morphemes are the smallest grammatical markers, or units, in language that alter words. In English, regular plurals are marked with an \u2013s morpheme (e.g., dog+s).\nSimilarly, English third singular verb forms (she eat+s, a boy kick+s) are marked with the \u2013s morpheme. Children are considered to acquire their first instances of third singular forms as entire phrasal chunks (Daddy kicks, a girl eats, a dog barks) without the ability to tease the finest grammatical components apart.", "Critical Period: Chomsky, along with other linguists, posited a critical period for language acquisition, during which the brain is particularly receptive to linguistic input, making language learning more efficient.\nCritics of Chomsky\u2019s theory argue that it\u2019s too innatist and doesn\u2019t give enough weight to social interaction and other factors in language acquisition.\nUniversal Grammar\nConsequently, he proposed the theory of Universal Grammar: an idea of innate, biological grammatical categories, such as a noun category and a verb category, that facilitate the entire language development in children and overall language processing in adults.\nUniversal Grammar contains all the grammatical information needed to combine these categories, e.g., nouns and verbs, into phrases. The child\u2019s task is just to learn the words of her language (Ambridge & Lieven).", "Language is a cognition that truly makes us human. Whereas other species do communicate with an innate ability to produce a limited number of meaningful vocalizations (e.g., bonobos) or even with partially learned systems (e.g., bird songs), there is no other species known to date that can express infinite ideas (sentences) with a limited set of symbols (speech sounds and words).\nThis ability is remarkable in itself. What makes it even more remarkable is that researchers are finding evidence for mastery of this complex skill in increasingly younger children.\nInfants as young as 12 months are reported to have sensitivity to the grammar needed to understand causative sentences (who did what to whom; e.g., the bunny pushed the frog (Rowland & Noble, 2010).", "Rowland, C.

Thus, knowledge derived from genetics and epigenetics, as well as from neuroscience, should be used to enhance education professionals' understanding of the biological origins of differences in mental capabilities, thereby empowering them with the possibility to adopt more respectful and flexible educational practices to attain the goal mentioned above.", "Genetics and Learning: How the Genes Influence Educational Attainment\n- PMID: 31354597\n- PMCID: PMC6635910\n- DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01622\nGenetics and Learning: How the Genes Influence Educational Attainment\nAbstract", "Keywords: adaptation; environment; epigenetics; genetics; heritability; learning.\nFigures\nReferences\n-\n- Allis D.

The current study investigates how variations in the language-related gene FOXP2 and executive function-related genes COMT, BDNF, and Kibra/WWC1 affect bilingual language control during two phases of speech production, namely the language schema phase (i.e., the selection of one language or another) and lexical response phase (i.e., utterance of the target). Chinese-English bilinguals (N = 119) participated in a picture-naming task involving cued language switches. Statistical analyses showed that both genes significantly influenced language control on neural coding and behavioral performance. Specifically, FOXP2 rs1456031 showed a wide-ranging effect on language control, including RTs, F(2, 113) = 4.00, FDR p =", "Genetic bases of language control in bilinguals: Evidence from an EEG study\n- PMID: 37051723\n- PMCID: PMC10203802\n- DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26301\nGenetic bases of language control in bilinguals: Evidence from an EEG study\nAbstract", "Keywords: bilingualism; electroencephalogram; executive function; genes; language control.\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

These are genes that are involved with critical biological processes, that are associated with disease screening, predisposition, promotion or suppression, or that have a potential clinical, diagnostic or therapeutic use. I would posit that traditional candidate gene approaches have also led to specific genes being interrogated more often since researchers build on existing knowledge. It\u2019s possible that relatively newer whole-genome sequencing methodologies may discover genetic correlations that were unfathomable by previous logic. This may open the door to studying a greater array and diversity of genes. Furthermore, many genetic polymorphisms may act in concert to produce a physiological response, which would have been difficult to show with older methodologies.", "If you work in the field of genetics, there\u2019s no doubt that many of these genes will look familiar to you. There are a disproportionate number of cancer genes on this list, which should come as no surprise as there has been a great deal of interest and funding towards cancer research. The most studied gene on this list \u2013 TP53 \u2013 is a tumour-suppressor, colloquially known as the \u2018guardian of the genome\u2019, and is mutated in nearly 50% of all human cancers.\n\u201cThat explains [TP53]\u2019s staying power,\u201d says Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In cancer, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no gene more important.\u201d *", "- APOE - Encodes apolipoprotein E, which has important roles in cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism.\n- IL6 - Encodes interleukin 6, an immune molecule that can both stimulate and suppress inflammation.\n- TGFB1 - Encodes transforming growth factor beta 1, an extracellular protein that controls cell proliferation and differentiation.\n- MTHFR - Encodes methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that helps to process amino acids.\n- ESR1 - Encodes oestrogen receptor 1, a nuclear receptor protein that has been a focus study in breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers.\n- AKT1 - Encodes a signaling protein known as a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which phosphorylates other proteins to activate them.\n[List adapted from Top Genes; Dolgin E, 2017*]", "2018-08-27\nWith the importance of human genomic research, the rise in popularity of precision medicine, as well as the inclusion of a genetic component in many interdisciplinary studies, it is clear that genetics is incredibly valuable. But - are some genes more interesting and, therefore, studied more often than others?\nSoftware engineer, Peter Kerpedjiev, Ph.D., answered this question by compiling a top-ten list of the most studied human genes of all time. The PubMed database, part of the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), contains tagged keywords in publications which allowed Dr. Kerpedjiev to extract all studies containing structure, function or location information of a specific gene or its encoded protein.*\n\u201cThe list was surprising,\u201d says Kerpedjiev, now a postdoc studying genomic-data visualization at Harvard Medical School. \u201cSome genes were predictable; others were completely unexpected.\u201d *", "I\u2019ll leave you with these two questions to ponder: What genes are going to be of great significance to research and to human health in the future? What are the up-and-coming genes with the potential to jump from bench to bedside and revolutionize healthcare? Only time will tell.\n* Dolgin E. The most popular genes in the human genome.

Historically, many scientifically significant discoveries were not found in the logical course of study, but rather in a bit of serendipity. For example, the revolutionary antibiotic penicillin was discovered by happy accident by Dr. Alexander Fleming at Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital in London in 1928 because he left his work bench in disarray before leaving for vacation and returned to find molded bread.
