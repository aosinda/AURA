First, in spite of best attempts at ensuring that the search strategy and literature consulted were wide-ranging, certain policy documents and commercial agreements may be confidential and not privy to the public. As such, the scoping review may not cover all relevant policy measures, considerations and outcomes, which could result in an incomplete picture of the strategies and their effectiveness in managing access and the cost of rare disease treatments. Second, the specific focus on high-income countries with advanced healthcare systems limits the generalizability of our findings to LMICs. In particular, LMICs face various challenges and have different healthcare infrastructure and funding mechanisms, which are not addressed in our review.

Collaborative efforts can better drive innovation and harmonize approval and reimbursement processes, benefiting patients worldwide.\nLimitations", "In the US, private health insurance is a major contributor to covering the costs of treatments, including those for rare diseases . However, coverage and out-of-pocket costs can vary significantly and the health systems can be challenging to navigate. An analysis of out-of-pocket spending on orphan drugs from 2013 to 2018 also found an increasing trend (almost doubling from 2013 to 2018) and a higher burden on payers and families despite private insurance coverage . Parents and guardians of children with SMA have also reflected drawn out processing coverage decisions by insurance companies, a lack of transparency in the claims and preauthorization processes and being dependent on employment insurance for coverage .", "Nonetheless, outcome-based pricing shifts some financial risks to drug manufacturers, who may only receive full payment upon proven effectiveness of the treatment. This risk might lead to higher initial pricing or reluctance from manufacturers to engage in further research and development of therapeutics for other rare diseases. Likewise, outcome-based pricing models require certain alterations in traditional healthcare insurance practices, which may be resistant to change due to established protocols and risk aversion. Defining reasonable outcomes that accurately reflect the effectiveness of the treatment can also be a challenge, especially when it comes to gene therapies where studies are still ongoing and long-term effects are not yet fully understood.

While the consideration of cost-effectiveness is pivotal for managing budgets, it poses a challenge in evaluating drugs for rare diseases due to their limited evidence base on effectiveness and higher pricing, influenced by extensive research costs and reduced competition in smaller markets . Accordingly, Australia established the LSDP in 1995 as a complementary initiative to the PBS", "Comparing these high-performing countries\u2019 approaches to rare disease funding reveals a fine balancing act between creating patient access and weighing budgetary impacts. While some countries have well-documented policies and reimbursement mechanisms for rare diseases, others lack detailed studies on the effectiveness and sustainability of their funding models. Identifying these gaps would help to direct future research efforts towards areas that require additional investigation. Singapore\u2019s approach resembles South Korea\u2019s practice of exempting certain orphan drugs from cost-effectiveness analysis. There are shared challenges in conducting such analyses for high-cost, rare disease drugs given the infrequency of rare diseases.

Policymakers must balance the ethical imperative to provide access to life-saving treatments with the practical constraints of healthcare budgets. Different countries have adopted various strategies to manage these challenges. For example, Australia utilizes the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP) and risk-sharing agreements , while Singapore relies on a rare disease fund that matches public donations . South Korea\u2019s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) covers certain orphan drugs based on cost-effectiveness analyses , the UK employs the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to evaluate treatments for cost-effectiveness , and the US combines federal and state programs with private insurance and non-profit support .", "Such arrangements are not new, and outcome-based rates, tied to short- and long-term outcomes of patients post-treatment, have been successfully established for other high-cost gene therapies in the US and elsewhere .

Advancements in gene therapy, such as treatments for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), have introduced novel therapeutic options, but the high costs, exemplified by Zolgensma\u00ae at US$2.1 million, present significant financial barriers. This scoping review aimed to compare the funding approaches for rare disease treatments across high-performing health systems in Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), aiming to identify best practices and areas for future research.\nMethods", "To address the high costs (and current uncertain long-term efficacy) of treatments for rare diseases like SMA, countries can benefit from implementing risk-sharing agreements with pharmaceutical companies. An important driver for uncertainty is the sustainability of remission, as it could range from 1 year to life-long effects. A risk-sharing agreement approach involves the government or healthcare providers negotiating with drug manufacturers to agree on terms that link the payment for the drugs to their performance in the real world or to specific outcomes. Given the paucity of long-term effectiveness data for treatments for rare diseases, making future payments conditional on the actual health outcomes and cost savings achieved would be a financially prudent approach for governments", "In terms of government-funded health insurance programs (Medicaid and Medicare), they provide coverage for certain individuals, including those with disabilities and the elderly. They may cover some treatments for rare diseases, depending on the state and specific policy details. In particular, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has provisions that impact rare disease patients, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, which includes many rare diseases . However, entry criteria for Medicaid relies on family income and assets that varies from one state to another .\nAlso worth mention is the numerous non-profit organizations in the US that provide support for rare disease research and advocate for patients . These organizations often fundraise to support research, increase awareness, and assist patients with accessing and affording treatments.\nDiscussion", "Risk-sharing agreements are commonly used by the PBS and LSDP to manage certain risks and uncertainties with new orphan drugs. Sponsors may voluntarily propose risk-sharing agreements with are captured through a legal deed of agreement that is negotiated between the sponsor and the Government. Some financial risk share agreements can be class deeds where sponsors share the risk based on market share. While such mutual agreements remain confidential, the majority of agreements are likely to be financial-based agreements which include price-volume, rebate or discount-based schemes . However, a hybrid of financial and outcome-based agreements is also possible .", ". Internationally, countries like Australia, the UK, and South Korea also utilize distinct risk-sharing agreements, which Singapore\u2019s framework does not currently emulate. Additionally, the RDF\u2019s reliance on public goodwill and donations admittedly creates funding instability, and the absence of an early access mechanism or a real-world data monitoring system for orphan drugs prolongs approval processes, contrasting with practices elsewhere. This would inadvertently result in inequities, particularly for patients with non-listed rare diseases. Similarly, in the US, the fragmented healthcare system results in varied access and high out-of-pocket costs, despite robust research funding and the Orphan Drug Act providing incentives for drug development.", "Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

These agreements can be structured in various ways, such as paying for a drug only if it meets certain efficacy benchmarks or spreading the cost over time based on continued patient benefit. This strategy aligns the interests of public healthcare systems, patients, and pharmaceutical companies, ensuring that payment is contingent on the actual value provided by the treatment.

By examining the existing policies, approval processes, and reimbursement mechanisms in these countries, this review seeks to identify best practices, learning points and potential areas for improvement in ensuring equitable access to treatment for patients with rare diseases. In addressing rare diseases, it is crucial to establish a suitable financing structure to avoid creating a schism between families who can afford these treatments and those who cannot. This also raises a parallel question on whether the price of rare disease therapies is justified, and how health systems can provide equitable treatment access for all patients, regardless of the rarity of their condition and the cost of treatment.\nMethods\nCountry selection", ". cost-effectiveness ratios) across the reviewed studies impeded close comparisons of the relative effectiveness and impact of different funding strategies. Future research should prioritize the development and use of uniform metrics to enhance the comparability and synthesis of findings.", "Conclusion\nThrough this scoping review and policy analysis, we recognize that while no country has effectively addressed the challenge of financing rare diseases, the majority have clearly acknowledged that fairness of access is a moral obligation of public health systems. Developed countries and high-performing health systems should further explore and implement outcome-based risk-sharing agreements to balance immediate costs with long-term benefits for patients afflicted by rare diseases. These agreements can ensure that payments are contingent on real-world efficacy, spreading financial risk and encouraging ongoing data collection. Given the rarity and substantial expense of treatments for rare diseases, the most feasible solution seems to lie in improving national healthcare insurance schemes. Equitable rare disease funding should be an area of continued interest and research.\nData availability", "The National Health Service (NHS) stands as the UK\u2019s publicly funded healthcare system, operating on the core principles of universality and free access to care for all, regardless of nationality or immigration status .

Such policies might include shorter patent life, taxes on drug profits, and mandated payments to NIH for funding initial research. A second type of regulation, though, may affect the profits of pharmaceutical companies without harming the marginal return to innovation\u2014for example, getting rid of tax write-offs for research into new drugs or increasing the corporate tax rate. In other words, it\u2019s possible to tax rents, reduce deadweight loss, and increase access without affecting the quantity of useful drugs being produced on the margin. In many cases, firms do not appear to be meaningfully cash constrained, so if policymakers avoid affecting the return on investment on the margin, they can still regulate prices without decreasing innovation.", "States have the potential for innovation and authority in this area, but the infrastructure for establishing health policy is lacking in many states. The secretary of health and the head of the state Medicaid program are typically the only officials focused on public health issues. The solution is to build up the public infrastructure at the state and local level. The CMS State Innovations Model Initiative (SIM) was a breakthrough in giving resources to the states and in thinking about health policy at a local level. One participant pointed out that the problem may come back to pricing. Louisiana is a poor state that couldn\u2019t treat its people. This was clear to pharmaceutical companies. In a richer state where there is room for negotiation, would pharmaceutical companies be as willing to negotiate? Does that make replicability harder?

They may, for instance, be taken fewer times a day and thus patient adherence may be better, a quality increase that could go unmeasured.", ". Anderson questioned whether this form of financing was optimal, whether it sways researchers to pursue one type of drug or form of research over another, and whether this structure has essentially led to a bidding war for promising drugs. In particular, while some premium on the drug is needed to cover the larger fixed costs of financing R&D and failed drug trials, the large profit margin in the case of Sovaldi implies that substantial rents are being extracted.", "Cutler also spoke about \u2018Me-Too\u2019 drugs, new drugs that are chemically or structurally similar to existing drugs. In general, the benefit of these drugs is the competition they bring to the market, rather than an improvement in treatment technology. Greater competition initially transfers rents from pharmaceutical companies to consumers. While there can be distributional consequences of this transfer, there is no welfare gain if there is no change in access or affordability. However, the greater access to drugs that should come from sufficiently lower prices spurred by competition should lead to an overall gain in welfare. This is an important distinction. Most of the increases in net social welfare come from increased access rather than lower costs. The costs of this welfare gain stem mostly from the cost of R&D necessary to create the new drugs, but the size of the tradeoff is unclear and often poorly measured", ". Such access questions can be even more severe for smaller subsets of the population, particularly disadvantaged or marginalized groups. For example, large concentrations of prison inmates have Hepatitis C, but only around 1% of them have received treatment. On questions of equity, it was suggested that the savings from drug-price declines could be invested in wider public health initiatives, specifically things influencing the social determinants of health.", "On innovation, some participants pointed to flaws in the FDA\u2019s benefit and risk framework for drug approval, noting that the focus is on the \u2018indicated patient\u2019 for a certain drug rather than on the entire population with a given disease. For example, a drug that decreases the probability of a heart attack on the margin and therefore saves thousands of lives each year might get less attention from the FDA than a drug that definitively saves a few lives by curing a particular disease. This creates distortions in the incentive for regulation. In addition, the regulatory framework does not focus on the negative externalities of drug approvals, with opioids being the most obvious example.", "Overview of Session 3: Discussion of incentive distortions arising from the current patent and market exclusivity system for new drugs", ". In other scenarios, though, the approval process can be difficult, given the ambiguousness of trial results. Certain cases that don\u2019t involve thick tails in patient responses based on a small sample size make it difficult for the FDA to assess the validity of trials using surrogate endpoints. Some standards therefore seem in order. Others argued that even if such approvals were made, allowing drugs to come to market faster, pharmaceutical companies are often still expected to complete the clinical trials through to their endpoints, which is costly. This may be because other countries also have stricter international standards for surrogate endpoints than the U.S.", "Conti viewed this as both an equity issue and an innovation issue. Pharmaceuticals receive government assistance for R&D through government grants and research cooperation. Such was the case for Gilead\u2019s Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which was funded by NIH, as Anderson pointed out in his earlier presentation. But Conti suggested innovators receive a disproportionate amount of the windfall. Taxpayers indirectly support innovators through the tax system and should have access to the fruit of this innovation. What Louisiana has done is shift the discussion towards allowing everyone to gain access to public health.", "One open question: If a change in regulation led to less R&D, would that lead to less overall innovation? In other words, are firms at the flat end of the R&D supply curve, where small changes in investment have little effect? There were also questions about the amount of rent being extracted by large pharmaceutical companies. Several participants noted that R&D costs (equipment, scientists, etc.) are relatively low, but real R&D spending has increased on net over the past few decades.

Several projects appear promising based on pre-clinical and clinical data, however, challenges remain including the validation of long-term sustained efficacy and safety profile in patients who received \u03b3RV- or LV-based HSPC-GT ex vivo.", ". With the treatment strategy to reduce the toxic effects of HTT, several clinical trials are ongoing with the use of ASOs for down-regulating HTT (Rodrigues and Wild, 2020), but recently disappointing results were reported from trials by Roche and Wave Therapeutics (Kingwell, 2021). To explore the potential of gene therapy, uniQure Biopharma, in 2019, has initiated a phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy after multiple ascending doses administered into the striatum of AAV5-miHTT encoding miRNA aimed at reducing levels of HTT (AMT-130) in adult patients with early manifest HD (NCT04120493; Rodrigues and Wild, 2020).", "A Short Overview of Gene Therapy Development", ". Two ongoing phase 4 long-term follow-up trials (NCT03421977, NCT04042025) have been initiated, enrolling participants who were treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi for SMA in the START study and previous (parent) studies for continuous monitoring of safety as well as monitoring of continued efficacy and durability of response to treatment. Despite a general favorable safety profile, some concerns have been raised, since at least three children with SMA developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), after being treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec (Chand et al., 2021). All three children developed TMA approximately 1 week after treatment, and they had all contributory factors, including concurrent infections and recent vaccine exposure, which could be putatively contributing to development of TMA. Moreover, coagulation abnormalities have been reported more frequently in children with SMA (Wijngaarde et al", ". A third clinical trial is recruiting advanced stage ALD patients to test the effects of ABCD1-corrected CD34-positive HSPCs (NCT02559830). A multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study will test ALD patients treated with Lenti-D vector modified HSPCs for an additional 13 years (NCT02698579).", "Great progress in gene therapy has been made over the last decade. From the approvals of Luxturna\u00ae (voretigene neparvovec), the first gene therapy against inherited eye diseases, Zolgensma\u00ae (onasemnogene abeparvovec) as treatment for SMA, and Libmeldy\u00ae for MLD, we stand on the brink of gene therapy to deliver on its promise to potentially cure or modulate severe diseases. The increasing number of development projects and progress highlighted in this review offers reasons for optimism toward novel gene therapy treatments being approved for rare genetic diseases of the brain and spinal cord in a foreseeable future. Fully aligned with these expectations the FDA has proclaimed that they expect to be approving 10\u201320 cell and gene therapies a year from 20256, and it is likely that some of these will fall within rare genetic diseases of the brain and spinal cord", ". This is an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study evaluating safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics after intracisternal delivery of RGX-111 to MPS I patients during the 24 weeks study period. An ongoing ex vivo phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT03488394) explores safety and efficacy of IV-injected autologous HSPCs genetically modified to express IDUA using a LV in patients with the Hurler variant. A long-term follow-up study will look for adverse neurologic and other events for up to 30 years after (NCT00695279). Genome editing has also been explored as a treatment approach. Both ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 platform studies where AAV8 vectors were injected IV to genome edit liver cells have shown encouraging results in rodents (Ou et al., 2020; Poletto et al., 2020). The latter platform may be more efficacious (Ou et al", "In recent years, gene therapy has been raising hopes toward viable treatment strategies for rare genetic diseases for which there has been almost exclusively supportive treatment. We here review this progress at the pre-clinical and clinical trial levels as well as market approvals within diseases that specifically affect the brain and spinal cord, including degenerative, developmental, lysosomal storage, and metabolic disorders. The field reached an unprecedented milestone when Zolgensma\u00ae (onasemnogene abeparvovec) was approved by the FDA and EMA for in vivo adeno-associated virus-mediated gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. Shortly after EMA approved Libmeldy\u00ae, an ex vivo gene therapy with lentivirus vector-transduced autologous CD34-positive stem cells, for treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy. These successes could be the first of many more new gene therapies in development that mostly target loss-of-function mutation diseases with gene replacement (e.g"], "title": "Current and Future Prospects for Gene Therapy for Rare Genetic Diseases ..."}}}
