Questions arise about who gets to decide what constitutes a \"normal\" trait and what is considered a disability or disorder. This could lead to a society that is less accepting of diversity and individual differences. There are also concerns about the potential for gene therapy to be used for enhancement purposes, such as improving intelligence or athletic ability, which raises ethical questions about the boundaries of human improvement.\n\nTo address these ethical concerns, it is important for the medical and bioethics community to closely examine the financial models of pharmaceutical companies and identify potential shifts in policies that could incentivize investment in rare disease treatment.

Here, we expand on our discussion of operating models and corporate structures for biotech startups by surveying types of partnerships that are valuable across different development stages, and provide actual examples of biotech\u2013pharma partnership agreements.\nPartnership considerations\nPartnerships are integral to the development of the assets of an early-stage company like Unravel, providing financial support and the know-how required to commercialize a drug. The startup would need to find the right balance between leveraging the partners\u2019 expertise in developing drugs and giving up equity to potential partners. We summarize the key partnerships discussed here in Fig. 5.", "The first challenge consists of producing a realistic financial valuation of a potential rare disease repurposed drug compound, in this case targeting Rett syndrome. More generally, we develop a framework to value a portfolio of pairwise correlated rare disease compounds in early-stage development and quantify its risk profile. We estimate the probability of a negative return to be \\(80.8\\%\\) for a single compound and \\(56.1\\%\\) for a portfolio of 8 drugs. The probability of selling the project at a loss decreases from \\(79.2\\%\\) (phase 3) for a single compound to \\(55.4\\%\\) (phase 3) for the 8-drug portfolio. For the second challenge, we find that the choice of operating model and corporate structure is crucial for early-stage biotech startups and illustrate this point with three concrete examples.\nConclusions", "Valuation model: multi-stage Monte Carlo simulation\nIn addition to performing a sensitivity analysis, we test the robustness of our results by running a multi-stage Monte Carlo simulation of our financial valuation using the @modelrisk software.

We then discuss and contrast the results obtained for both valuations before turning to a survey of key operating models and corporate structures observed among early-stage biotech companies.\nMethods", "Finally, we should note that as compounds for Rett syndrome are brought to market, e.g., trofinetide (approved March 2023 as Daybue, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, $375,000/year), their price would likely be a reasonable estimate of the upper bound for the potential price of Unravel\u2019s compound. This type of ceiling estimation has been used in the past, for example, with Cerezyme (imiglucerase) for Gaucher\u2019s disease , Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) for cystic fibrosis , and Esbriet (pirfenidone) for pulmonary fibrosis . Nevertheless, we have opted for a more conservative price point in line with other orphan drugs despite Daybue's price due to its very limited market exposure as of publication.", "We increase the flexibility of the model by accounting for more complex interactions between the drugs composing our portfolio. In particular, we allow some drugs in the portfolio to start in different phases of the drug development process. For example, some drugs may be a \u201cfollow-on\u201d of other drugs for the same disease (i.e., \u201cme-too\u201d drugs), thus having a higher \\(\\text{PoS}\\) in the preclinical phase once the original drug has been proven to be effective and reaches phase 2. The \\(\\text{PoS}\\) of the drugs composing our portfolio are allowed to have non-zero pairwise correlations in each phase; here, we have assumed a moderate value of \\(0.2\\), consistent with the specific nature of rare diseases, which do not tend to exhibit high degrees of correlation . In addition, we assume a non-zero pairwise correlation of 0.2 for the market valuation in each phase for the Gaussian copula across the drugs in the portfolio. These modulable assumptions are summarized in Table 7.", ". Finally, this simple structure can lead to a portfolio financing approach, given that the company will hold all assets under a single entity.", "Portfolio valuation\nAs discussed earlier, considering a portfolio of drugs can potentially lower the investor\u2019s risk through diversification. Here, we explore the financial performance of different portfolios of drugs within the space of rare diseases, and run Monte Carlo simulations using the @modelrisk software as described in the previous section. The portfolio of drugs under consideration is based on recommendations received from Unravel Biosciences.\nData and assumptions: development stage and valuation hypotheses\nWe summarize in Table 3 the main assumptions used to calibrate the parameters of our portfolio simulations. Commercial stage assumptions are the same as those used for the Rett syndrome compound valuation (see Table 2). The lower and upper bounds provided are used to test the robustness of our results. We discuss our assumptions regarding the development and commercial stages of the drugs composing our portfolio in Appendix A.", "Based on the multi-stage Monte Carlo simulations we performed for both a single rare disease compound and a portfolio of 8 moderately correlated rare disease compounds, we find the risk profile of a portfolio of drugs to be much more attractive than that of a single compound. In particular, the probability of observing a negative overall NPV, estimated for a single compound at \\(80.8\\%\\), decreases to \\(56.1\\%\\) for a portfolio of 8 drugs. Furthermore, the probability of selling the project at a loss, estimated for a single compound at \\(38.3\\%\\), \\(67.5\\%\\), and \\(79.2\\%\\) for phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, decreases to \\(11.2\\%\\), \\(38.7\\%\\), and \\(55.4\\%\\) for phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, when considering a portfolio of 8 drugs", "- Research\n- Open access\n- Published:\nFinancing repurposed drugs for rare diseases: a case study of Unravel Biosciences\nOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseases volume 18, Article number: 287 (2023)\nAbstract\nBackground\nWe consider two key challenges that early-stage biotechnology firms face in developing a sustainable financing strategy and a sustainable business model: developing a valuation model for drug compounds, and choosing an appropriate operating model and corporate structure.

The subsidiary is a separate entity from the parent company, having its own tax and regulatory treatments, as well as separate liabilities. This differentiates them from business divisions, which are held within the same company, and are not distinct legal entities.\nThere are several reasons for which a company might choose to set up a subsidiary instead of deciding to become a business division. As discussed above, a subsidiary is a good way to limit the liability of the parent company. This limitation is especially useful in risky endeavors like drug development, with high probabilities of large losses.

Technology licensing has the advantage of limited upfront financial investment, and therefore lower risk. Licensing is also a good way to start generating revenue, thus making it easier to attract funding from venture capital firms. Finally, it can help the startup build credibility before expanding downstream into development and commercialization.\nCons. Technology licensing also has certain disadvantages. It provides less differentiation from other biotech companies, and therefore lowers the chance of successfully completing a licensing agreement with big pharma companies. It also provides less negotiating power on the valuation of the startup\u2019s technology, due to the significant risks in upcoming phases of clinical development.

This would allow the company to take advantage of the portfolio financing approach at both the parent and the subsidiary levels. It would also enable the company to take advantage of synergies between the different drugs and allocate developmental resources as it sees fit. Finally, it would also make it easier for the company to compensate the gains and losses from the drugs, since the drug subsidiary entity would have a single tax filing and would not need to worry about having more than \\(80\\%\\) ownership of each drug asset. However, this structure might make it harder to attract talent and partner with patient- and disease-centered organizations given that all its resources and drug development efforts would be pooled into a single entity.", "Patient Adoption and Price. As outlined in Table 2, we assume a staged adoption rate across different age ranges within the patient pool in the U.S. In general, assumptions about patient adoption need to be refined through conversations with the company and clinical contacts interested in the development of the drug.

We further assume adoption rates in years 1 and 2 will be one-third and two-thirds of the peak, respectively, and that the adoption rates for the 12\u201324 years and 24\u201348 years age groups will be 75% and 50% of the adoption rate for the 0\u201312 years age group, respectively", "Actual NPV (in Year 0) of Selling the Project Upon Completion of Each Phase.

We encourage the reader to relax or modify these assumptions to better reflect their use case.\nFinally, we have confined our attention to the case of Rett syndrome repurposed drug compounds.

From a societal perspective, estimating the \u201cfair\u201d price of a drug can raise complex ethical debates.

In this section, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of three typical operating models within the biotech world, and discuss one common choice of corporate structure among early-stage biotech companies, which entails creating subsidiaries.

A liquid biopsy, for example, can help identify cancer cells by testing a sample of blood. At a 2019 conference, California-based Grail presented data that it said confirms its ability to detect early-stage cancer with a single blood test. The company said it detected strong signals for 12 cancers with a 99 percent specificity rate.6", "Genetic testing: Whole-genome sequencing is a powerful and revolutionary tool. In fact, the genetic testing market is expected to reach US$17.6 million by 2025 with a CAGR of 11.3 percent.4 Early detection of a disease, or the ability to determine who might be genetically predisposed to a disease, could make it possible to cure an illness in the early stages or prevent it altogether. As gene sequencing, our ability to interpret the data, and gene-editing tools become more sophisticated, we expect to see an increase in early detection and preventative or curative interventions.\nSome of our interviewees noted that the ability to use genetic information to identify patients at risk for developing disease could create an opportunity for biopharma companies.\n\u201cIt is conceivable that if biopharma companies, NIH, academia, and others don\u2019t ramp up their ability to cure disease, we could have a population of people who have an early diagnosis but no cure.\u201d\u2014Academic researcher", "Vaccines: Vaccines are being developed that include but expand beyond childhood or common infectious diseases. In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine to prevent the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cervical cancer.2 If used widely enough, the vaccine could substantially reduce and potentially eliminate cervical cancer. Two other examples of virally transfused cancers include the human T-lymphotropic virus type 3 (HTLV-3) and the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer. Over the next 20 years, more vaccines could be developed that prevent more types of cancer. The industry is beginning to think differently about the impact vaccines could have on other types of cancer by using the patient\u2019s own immunity against self-antigens that are expressed in tumor cells. While these too are vaccines, they bear no resemblance to vaccines that prevent an infectious agent.", "Stratifying disease to target the best drug intervention: Advances in the understanding of biomarkers and genetic markers have helped researchers identify subpopulations within broader disease categories. Parkinson\u2019s disease, for example, has a number of clear genetic subsets and various mutations. It\u2019s actually a set of discrete diseases, and some variations of Parkinson\u2019s look different than others. In the future, we will likely be able to identify increasingly smaller subsets of patients based on genetic lesions, differences in protein expression, and the microbiome. Biopharma companies might be able to develop or target therapies to the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.", "If the future of health emerges in the way we expect it will, we could see some consolidation among generic-drug manufacturers. Most could benefit from developing a business model that focuses on more customized treatments. Manufacturers that are able to leverage prescribing and outcomes data for generic drugs may be well-positioned to match patients to appropriate therapies. Further, investment in additive manufacturing capabilities and distribution channels could enable companies to manufacture customized treatment combinations, and tailored doses. Manufacturers might also partner with consumer-focused retailers to develop customized drug packaging and distribute their products directly to patients. Some manufacturers might forge partnerships directly with health systems or consortiums to supply them with products.", "By 2040 (and perhaps beginning much before), streams of health data\u2014together with data from a variety of other relevant sources\u2014will likely merge to create a multifaceted and highly personalized picture of every consumer\u2019s well-being. Many digital health companies are already beginning to incorporate always-on biosensors and software into devices that can generate, gather, and share data. Advanced cognitive technologies could be developed to analyze a significantly large set of parameters and create personalized insights into a consumer\u2019s health. The availability of data and personalized AI can enable precision well-being and real-time microinterventions that allow us to get ahead of sickness and far ahead of catastrophic disease. By 2040, health is likely to revolve around preventing some diseases from happening, and curing others. Many fewer people would have long-term conditions with continued need for medication to treat symptoms.1", "MyMee: The three-year-old digital care program focuses on chronic autoimmune disorders. It allows users to input and track their daily activities, and then make sense of any patterns in the data that might be impacting their health. It also connects users with a health coach. Anecdotal stories on MyMee\u2019s website highlight individuals who were able to learn about and understand the triggers that are negatively impacting their bodies. In response, they were able to change their diets and lifestyle habits to avoid those triggers.", "The forces of change highlighted in this paper are likely to reshape, if not shrink, the market for biopharma products. Biopharma companies should consider the potential for disruption by these forces as they redefine the types of products and solutions they will offer, where they will compete, and the new capabilities they will require. Company leaders should develop strategies to counter potential threats and take advantage of the short- and long-term opportunities that emerge in this changing environment. Organizations that ignore these forces and maintain the status quo could wind up shrinking in parallel to the demand for drug interventions to manage symptomatic diseases.", "As we move toward the future of health, biopharma incumbents should consider new strategic investments to position themselves for success. The changes that we see on the horizon will likely require biopharma companies to consider new types of markets, alternative business models, or a complete change in how they define what work they do.\nPrevention of disease and a shift to wellness is a core pillar of Deloitte\u2019s perspective on the future of health. We expect that over the next 20 years, we will be able to detect some diseases\u2014and prevent them from advancing\u2014possibly even before symptoms surface. Today, for example, clinicians can detect the early stages of melanoma much earlier than in the past, and early treatment can eliminate the disease completely. Not intervening until it metastasizes results in complications and expensive treatments. Early detection of other types of cancer could reduce or eliminate the need for future therapies.", "In the years ahead, the delivery of vaccines could move away from the traditional syringe as a delivery device. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a study that showed how an influenza vaccine could produce an effective immune response through a bandage strip lined with a patch of painless microneedles that are just long enough to penetrate the skin. The needles, which are painless, dissolve minutes after the vaccine is delivered and the bandage can be thrown away.3 In the future, such patches could be mailed directly to patients who could administer a vaccine themselves, increasing access and adoption.", "The future of health that we envision in 2040 will be a world apart from what we have now. Based on emerging technology, we can be reasonably certain that digital transformation\u2014enabled by radically interoperable data, AI, and open, secure platforms\u2014will drive much of this change. Unlike today, we believe care will be organized around the consumer, rather than around the institutions that drive our existing health care system.", "We define a customized treatment as a single therapy, or mix of therapies, that is selected, tailored, or developed to treat an individual. This requires leveraging data to identify the best drug treatment option (single or combination therapy), the right dosing, and possibly customizing treatment for an individual patient. Getting to this level of customization will likely require a wealth of data\u2014either through the use of real-world evidence (RWE) to effectively target or repurpose existing treatments\u2014or new clinical trial paradigms that help identify high responders and optimal dosing. Given the need for data, we envision that the early advances in personalized treatments will be seen with generic and late\u2013life cycle medications, which have a wealth of RWE available to inform the stratification of the disease, tailored dosing, and tailored regimens.", "Another interviewee told us that CRISPR has been used to destroy viruses and bacterial infections. He also said that CRISPR can be used to program bacteria to guard against other bacteria. For example, researchers at the Western University in London, Ontario, successfully used a CRISPR-associated enzyme called Cas9 to eliminate a species of Salmonella using E. coli bacteria. Scientists at the Broad Institute also recently published a study that demonstrated that another enzyme called Cas13 could be programmed to kill three different kinds of single-stranded RNA viruses.14 However, one CRISPR leader pointed out that gene editing might only address part of the problem for multifactor diseases. Drug therapy might still be required to manage other variables that drive disease expression.", "Our interviews confirmed that five forces are beginning to impact biopharma companies but are likely to disrupt the sector more dramatically in the years ahead. Most of our interviewees agreed with our vision for the future of health that these forces\u2014driven by players inside and outside of the biopharma sector\u2014could have a seismic impact on biopharmaceutical companies and the patients they serve. The five forces, listed in order of potential disruption to the traditional scope of the biopharma industry, are:\nPrevention and early detection: Vaccines and improvements in wellness could help prevent disease, making treatment for some diseases no longer necessary. Advances in early detection will likely enable interventions that halt diseases in the earliest stages\u2014before they progress to more serious conditions.", "A note to readers: This research was conducted before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) became a focus for drug and vaccine development. At the time of publication, academic and biopharma researchers were increasing data transparency, leveraging accelerated regulatory pathways, and setting up adaptive trials to develop and test drugs and vaccines to address the pandemic. It is too early to opine on the timing and impact of those activities and how the forces we describe in this paper might accelerate or change how biopharma responds to pandemics in the future. We look forward to reporting about innovative approaches and lessons learned from this situation.", "Considerations: The future of digital therapeutics depends on user adoption, the ability to demonstrate impact, and optimization of pricing/reimbursement. Some interviewees were skeptical of the long-term adoption, or stickiness, of digital therapeutics. While some patients might try the technology, they might lose interest after a few days or weeks. Our interviewees also cautioned that higher socioeconomic classes are more likely than lower classes to use these technologies, which could further widen health disparities. Other interviewees countered that if the digital experience is user-friendly, includes a human touch when necessary, incorporates storytelling (rather than commands), and truly understands the motivations for each patient (whether that be more free time, better health, or something else), adoption will likely continue to grow. Non-negotiable, however, is that these technologies need to demonstrate results", "Livongo: Livongo, founded in 2008, is a digital health management app for chronic diseases. The platform focuses on multiple conditions, including diabetes, prediabetes, weight management, hypertension, and behavioral health. It aims to close gaps in care, provide refill deliveries, and personalize care through both its digital offering and access to real-time health specialists and coaches. In 2017, Livongo presented at the Annual American Diabetes Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions showing that it decreased costs by 5.8 percent compared to non-Livongo users, helping save US$83 per participant per month.23", "Digital therapeutics that reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention: Digital therapeutics are increasing access to medical providers, which could reduce the need for drug treatments. For example, many digital therapeutics rely on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment that has been shown to improve patient outcomes across a range of mental health diseases. Virtual coaches, for example, can help patients modify behavior in the moment to reduce the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Sleepio, a digital treatment for insomnia that does not involve drug therapy, is one example that is covered by a PBM in lieu of pharmaceutical sleep agents. Some digital therapeutics are empowering patients to take charge of their symptoms for complex chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases (see the sidebar, \u201cNew digital therapeutics help patients manage their chronic diseases\u201d).", "Curative therapies\u2014time-limited treatments that remove symptoms of a disease through the permanent (or semipermanent) correction of the underlying condition\u2014have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of many diseases. Several of our interviewees predicted that diseases driven by single genetic mutations (e.g., certain cancers, sickle cell anemia, and some rare diseases) are likely to be among the first ones treated by curative therapies. At the end of 2019, more than 1,000 clinical trials were being executed worldwide for cell and gene therapies (see figure 3).13 These trials are targeting a breadth of diseases including cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. While biopharma is at the forefront of developing these treatments, keeping pace with a rapidly changing environment will likely require new business models.", "In this future of health, the era of blockbuster drugs that treat large populations will likely wane. Instead, the biopharma sector is on the fringe of an era where hypertailored therapies are developed to cure or prevent disease rather than treat symptoms. Twenty years from now, rather than picking up a prescription at the pharmacy, personalized therapies based on a diverse set of a patient\u2019s characteristics including their genomics, metabolome, microbiome, and other clinical information might be manufactured or compounded just in time through additive manufacturing.\nHow might exponential advancements in science and technology impact biopharma companies? What are some examples of disruption already happening in the market, and how quickly is change likely to occur? To find out, researchers from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions conducted interviews with 14 forward-thinking industry experts (for more details see the sidebar, \u201cMethodology\u201d).", "About 90 percent of all prescription drug purchases are for generics, according to the IQVIA Institute. Unlike some high-cost therapies that treat a small portion of the population, the generic-drug business model is based entirely on high-volume treatments that target large populations. If more diseases are cured or prevented, the need for generic drugs that treat chronic diseases could be reduced significantly, which could disrupt the volume-based model. Increased focus on nutrition, for example, could mean fewer people have high cholesterol, which would translate to a smaller market for generic statins.", "Gene therapies: The first gene therapy in the United States was approved in 2019, and many more are in the pipeline. Most of these therapies target diseases driven by a single or a few genetic mutations. One interviewee said he expects to \u201csee cures for diseases that are well-defined by genetic mutations based on better gene therapy.\u201d Such diseases could include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, fragile X syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington\u2019s disease.\nOne academic researcher told us that we might be able to cure cancer subtypes that are caused by specific oncogenes passed down in families, such as BRCA. Gene replacement, for example, could replace prophylactic mastectomies. He cautioned that there are many safety concerns with this approach and said it could be difficult to replace the gene in all of a person\u2019s cancer-causing cells. Diseases that are cell nonautonomous might be more attractive, he added.", "By 2040, some diseases will be prevented, cured, or managed with nonpharmacological interventions. If that vision is correct, we could have fewer people with chronic diseases and less need for therapies that treat those conditions. As a result, what has historically been in-bounds for the pharma sector\u2014such as the treatment of chronic diseases\u2014could erode. \u201cIf pharma wants to survive, they should broaden themselves significantly,\u201d said one former executive of a global pharmaceutical company.\nWhen we look back on the sector 20 years from now, we may describe our current approach to disease and treatments as crude. Pharmaceutical companies that are able to reimagine their traditional business model may be most likely to succeed in a future built around prevention, early detection, and personalized therapies.", "Nutrition and microbiome: Everyone has a unique microbiome, and researchers are just beginning to understand the relationship between these tiny organisms and how they influence mental and physical health. In 2018, the global human microbiome market was valued at US$351.81 million,7 and over 100 companies are investing in analyzing data related to the microbiome.8\nThe estimated 38 trillion microorganisms that exist within our bodies can have an impact on physical and mental health, which gives new meaning to the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat.\u201d A better understanding of the microbiome could lead to more effective ways to prevent disease. Microbes found in the guts of children, for example, could be related to childhood diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes.9 Recent research also suggests that the microbiome could influence how susceptible a patient might be to certain types of cancer, or how a patient is likely to respond to immunotherapy.10", "Tailored dosing: Predictive analytics and the ability to analyze longitudinal and integrated data sets for diverse patient populations could help biopharma companies determine optimal dosing levels for patients, who is most likely to respond, and under what conditions. This data could help companies develop customized treatment regimens for specific types of patients.", "Further, additive manufacturing could lead to new ways of delivering drugs. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) could be combined at the point of care, allowing for customized therapies. One physician interviewee predicted, \u201cWe will be giving patients one pill with everything rather than a number of pills.\u201d She noted that this a common patient pain point that physicians often don\u2019t see. Case in point: In 2015, Spritam became the world\u2019s first 3D-printed drug approved by the FDA and was used to treat epilepsy. Further, startups such as FabRX are aiming to provide personalized medicines through 3D printing. FabRX\u2019s proprietary technology, Printlets, offers personalized dosages, polypills, chewable medicines, and fast-dissolving tablets.11", "Considerations: Curative therapies will likely require new business models that address the shift in cost from chronic treatment to a one-time treatment. The long-term health economic value of cures could be tremendous, but data will be needed to demonstrate value before widespread adoption can occur. Companies will likely need to develop sophisticated methods for monitoring post-treatment patients to help shape the value story. Questions about how the cost and benefits for a one-time curative treatment should be allocated need to be addressed. Lastly, companies might need to explore novel financing mechanisms to enable both access and affordability given that the short-duration treatment has the potential for a life time of benefit.", "Considerations:Our understanding of what drives disease is continually evolving, and some diseases don\u2019t have a clear underlying cause. As one interviewee pointed out, \u201cThere is no way to determine why some people develop rheumatoid arthritis and some people don\u2019t.\u201d But the groundwork is already being laid for a world with a greater ability to detect and prevent disease. Diagnostics, and their resulting data, are likely to become powerful tools going forward. Advanced analytics of data collected from diagnostics, combined with patient health records, could help identify patterns related to the causes and early markers of disease. Pharma companies should learn to leverage the insights that come from these technologies to develop pathways and treatments for early intervention.", "Nanotechnology: Microscopic nanotechnology particles have the potential to enter diseased tissues and deliver more targeted and precise medical interventions. One of our interviewees said, \u201cWe will have an active nanomechanical system that can go through and do different things in the body, like replace tissues and cell types.\u201d Case in point: A team of scientists at the University of California, San Diego, created \u201cnanosponges\u201d that can go through the body and remove toxins from bacterial pathogens and inflammatory conditions.24 Nanotechnology might even evolve to include living cells. Researchers at the University of Vermont and Tufts University have designed organic robots by joining together specific types of stem cells taken from a well-studied species of African frog, Xenopus laevis. They suggest that bots derived in a similar manner, using the person\u2019s own cells, could be injected into the bloodstream to remove plaque from artery walls.25", "Sleepio: Sleepio, a digital sleep improvement program, was founded in 2010. Using cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques to address sleep disorders, the app strives to be entertaining as well as tailored to each user. A 2012 paper published in the trade journal Sleep determined Sleepio to be more effective than a placebo and helped 76 percent of users achieve healthy sleep levels.20 In a 2018 JAMA Psychiatry paper, about 75 percent of Sleepio users saw an improvement in sleep after going through the company\u2019s six-week program.21 These results spurred the United Kingdom\u2019s NHS to pay for the use of the app.22", "The five forces described above should push biopharma companies to ask themselves some hard questions about the markets they are in and how the threat of disruption could impact them. The current model of selling therapies that treat symptoms or mitigate the progression of chronic diseases is no longer viable. Sales volumes for drugs across disease areas are likely to decline due to more effective prevention, greater stratification of disease, better tailoring of drug regimens for patients, an increase in curative therapies, behavioral intervention, and advanced medical procedures.\nIn the face of these five forces, biopharma companies should ask themselves:", "Tissue engineering\u2014in combination with additive manufacturing\u2014could be used to restore damaged tissues. One interviewee noted that we\u2019d likely start there, and then we\u2019d harvest organs. He suggested that at some point in the future, patients might be presented with multiple options to treat tissue or organ dysfunction. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to fix it, regenerate tissue, or grow replacements, perhaps through xenotransplantation,\u201d he predicted. Advances in this technology could fix chronic diseases, eliminating the need for ongoing drug therapy. Case in point: Researchers at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital tissue-engineered human pancreatic islets in a laboratory. The engineered tissue develops a circulatory system, secretes hormones such as insulin, and has successfully treated sudden-onset Type 1 diabetes in mice.27", "The way individuals express disease and respond to treatment varies greatly. The vast majority of patients may not receive the full potential benefit of drugs that they are treated with because we don\u2019t yet know how to effectively stratify patient populations, one interviewee noted. A therapy that is effective for one patient, might be metabolized differently by another patient and never reach the optimal active concentration, he noted. Giving each patient a personalized dosage, or the optimal combination of drugs, could lead to better outcomes.", "Tailored drug regimens: Clinicians of the future might be able to examine a range of biomarkers and genetic information\u2014as well as clinical and behavioral digital health data\u2014to determine the appropriate drug combinations for a patient. This could be similar to how doctors are now able to sequence tumors, identify mutations, and match the appropriate therapy in cancer patients.", "The Deloitte Center for Health Solutions conducted telephone interviews with 14 industry experts including researchers, academics, futurists, investors, and former biopharmaceutical company executives from September to December of 2019. In addition, we conducted secondary research to identify startups and established companies that are already beginning to disrupt the biopharma sector.", "For example, data on how a patient metabolizes a drug could be used to ensure he/she gets the precise dose that will optimize effectiveness and minimize toxicity. The concept of pharmacogenomics has been around for a long time, but little progress has been made when it comes to using this information to determine effective dosing. Systematic evaluation of how patients metabolize drugs by evaluating the expression of liver enzymes (CYP450) or kidney function could enable more optimal dosing to get patients into therapeutic ranges. One interviewee said, \u201cPharmacogenomic data will become part of the electronic medical record.\u201d", "There was also some discussion that our ever-growing knowledge of genetic risks could lead to under- or over-treatment. Case in point: In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that seven women from the same family underwent major surgeries after a genetic test determined they all had an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.5 Since then, we\u2019ve learned the increased risk associated with this particular gene is not quite as high as previously thought. The surgeries, which led to complications, might not have been necessary.", "Robotic surgery: Historically, the scope of surgeries has been limited by the clumsiness of human hands, requiring drug therapy to manage the remaining disease. Robotic surgery is now the standard of care for many procedures, and medtech companies are investing in technology to advance capabilities including integrating them with augmented/virtual reality, AI, advanced analytics, and other emerging technologies. In the future, previously inoperable sites might be reachable, which could increase the efficacy of these platforms. For example, cancer patients who have hard-to-reach tumors have historically been treated with systemic therapies and radiation. Advances in robotic surgery have made it possible to remove a tumor wrapped around the spinal cord, for example, and eliminate or reduce the need for chemotherapy.", "Another interviewee pointed out that stem cells are the raw materials for cellular therapies, similar to bone marrow. During the next 20 years, biopharma companies might get close to the process of sourcing these raw materials and could consider using them to treat disease. \u201cIn the future, we might be able to extract bone marrow from a young patient, store it, and use it to cure an autoimmune illness that we know is likely to develop in that person as they reach their 40s,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThis idea might be science fiction today, but 20 years from now, some pharmaceutical companies might have stem cell transplant centers.\u201d Magenta Therapeutics is an example of a company that is working on this today.", "Considerations: These technologies could be highly disruptive to biopharmaceutical companies by eliminating the need for drug therapy. These interventions might be poised to reduce the need for major classes of drugs such as chemotherapy, insulin, and drugs for inflammatory conditions. Biopharma companies working in impacted disease areas should consider adopting some of these technologies, or risk operating in a much smaller market in the future.", "Cell therapies: Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy is driving research and development activity among many biopharma companies. The most publicized form of ACT (CAR-T) uses the patient\u2019s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. Two therapies using this technology have been approved in the United States, and many more are in development.15 These therapies could treat previously difficult-to-treat late-stage cancers and have led to high rates of remission. As researchers reduce the cost of making and delivering these therapies, and reduce or better manage toxicities, they could move upstream in treatment plans to become the standard of care.", "Our interviewees suggested that other chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, might be treated more effectively if they are identified early. They also noted that earlier detection of a disease\u2014or an understanding that a disease might be avoidable\u2014could motivate people to adopt healthier lifestyles.", "Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based interventions to patients through software programs that help prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. This technology could be a viable alternative to traditional pharmacologic treatments, or used in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes. Digital therapeutics, for example, might use an app-based platform to target modifiable chronic diseases such as diabetes, depression, anxiety, and heart disease.", "Digital therapeutics that help make drug treatment more effective: Some digital therapeutics are helping patients take a more holistic approach to managing their disease, including combining drug treatments with nondrug treatments. For example, diabetes digital programs combine a blood-glucose monitor with actionable insights and personalized coaching. Real-time tracking of drug therapy and symptoms allow doctors and coaches to intervene and modify therapy before symptoms escalate. Some of these digital interventions have been FDA-approved and health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are paying for them. Express Scripts, for example, has established a digital formulary that evaluates digital interventions based on clinical research, usability, and financial value.16 Livongo\u2019s digital therapeutics for diabetes, prediabetes, and hypertension have received preferred formulary status (see the sidebar, \u201cNew digital therapeutics help patients manage their chronic diseases\u201d).", "More sophisticated medical technology might enable earlier interventions and more effective procedures that reduce or even eliminate the need for pharmaceutical management. This includes advances in robotic surgery, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering. Some of our interviewees suggested that as these technologies become more sophisticated, they could lead to dramatically improved outcomes in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory conditions, and chronic pain.", "One interviewee suggested that applications of this technology could expand beyond oncology into autoimmune diseases. \u201cWe\u2019ll better understand where the immune system has been programmed up and learn to program it down using CAR-T,\u201d he said. He also suggested that we might be able to use gene and cell therapy to reprogram our bone marrow/immune system, but noted that it would be a \u201clonger, harder road with weird speed bumps.\u201d", "Customized treatments: Personalization in medicine\u2014driven by data-powered insights\u2014could effectively match patients with customized drug cocktails, or design therapies that would work for just a few people, or even a particular person (i.e., \u201cn of 1\u201d).\nCurative therapies: As with prevention, treatments that cure disease could reduce or eliminate the demand for some prescription medicines. Developing, marketing, and pricing these curative treatments could require the biopharma sector to adopt new capabilities.\nDigital therapeutics: Increasingly effective and scalable nonpharmaceutical (digital) interventions\u2014including those focused on behavior modification\u2014might also reduce or eliminate demand for medications.\nPrecision intervention: Increasingly sophisticated medical technology\u2014such as precise medical intervention enabled by robotics, nanotechnology, or tissue engineering\u2014could reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention.", "3D printing and tissue engineering: Manufacturers and clinicians could use 3D printing to create highly customized, low-cost medical technology products that are tailored to each patient\u2019s unique physiology. Everything from prosthetics to skin for burn victims to organs to implants (dental and orthopedic) can be produced through 3D printing. In some applications, 3D printing offers solutions where none existed. For example, airway splints for babies with tracheobronchomalacia (a rare condition where the tracheal or windpipe cartilage is soft) can be created by a 3D printer.26", ". One interviewee suggested that the adoption of health care apps will likely reach a tipping point once major health systems, health plans, and large pharmacies \u201cprioritize digital therapeutics over prescriptions and pay for them.\u201d", "Considerations: A proliferation of real-world data sources could help health care stakeholders understand which drugs work best for which patients and under which circumstances. Biopharma companies should be at the forefront of understanding heterogenous patient populations. However, being at the forefront will likely require significant investments in data and analytics capabilities. Companies should consider new drug-development paradigms, such as master protocols, that enable the evaluation of drugs alone or in combination in specified patient subpopulations.12 This shift toward increasingly customized treatments could have a significant impact on the biopharma supply chain. Smaller-volume therapies could require new manufacturing capabilities\u2014not just for branded manufacturers, but all generics (see the sidebar, \u201cThe future of generic drug manufacturing\u201d).", "Over the next 20 years, we expect biopharma business models to be reshaped by five forces\u2014from inside and outside of the industry\u2014that will likely require current players to evaluate shifting markets and determine how they will compete. Biopharma companies will continue to develop new ways to treat and cure a wide range of diseases. However, actionable health insights, driven by radically interoperable data and artificial intelligence (AI), can help clinicians and consumers identify illness much earlier than we do today. Vaccines and other early interventions could prevent a greater number of diseases from developing in the first place. Other illnesses might be prevented through nonpharmacological treatments.

In November 2019, the RDF was expanded to cover Pompe disease, a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder where patients can incur medical expenses exceeding S$500,000 each year . Two years later, the RDF was extended to support the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI as well . As of 2023, the RDF covers five conditions and seven medications , and has helped relieve the medical financial burden of nine Singaporean patients . It is important to note that the scope of the RDF caters to a relatively small percentage of families requiring additional financial assistance for high-cost treatments. Other avenues, such as Medisave, MediShield Life, and MediFund , exist to assist the majority of individuals with rare diseases by covering treatments and medical bills", "Using combinations of relevant key words including \u2018orphan disease\u2019, \u2018rare disease\u2019 and \u2018orphan drugs\u2019, we searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies published up to 31 May 2024. The full search strategy is displayed in the supplementary (Table S1). The search focused on published original research articles, reviews, policy papers, and government reports related to rare disease funding and policy. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that detailed drug approval processes, reimbursement decisions and funding mechanisms in the five high-income countries (Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the UK and US), and published in the last decade (published during or after 2010) to ensure it covers recent policy changes. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies and editorial/opinion pieces lacking substantial data.\nInternet-based search", "Nonetheless, outcome-based pricing shifts some financial risks to drug manufacturers, who may only receive full payment upon proven effectiveness of the treatment. This risk might lead to higher initial pricing or reluctance from manufacturers to engage in further research and development of therapeutics for other rare diseases. Likewise, outcome-based pricing models require certain alterations in traditional healthcare insurance practices, which may be resistant to change due to established protocols and risk aversion. Defining reasonable outcomes that accurately reflect the effectiveness of the treatment can also be a challenge, especially when it comes to gene therapies where studies are still ongoing and long-term effects are not yet fully understood. The added administrative burden for healthcare providers and insurers to keenly track and monitor patient outcomes could also potentially impede the overall efficiency of the healthcare system .", "Lu CY, Lupton C, Rakowsky S, Babar ZU, Ross-Degnan D, Wagner AK.

In 2021, Member of Parliament Cheryl Chan called for the RDF to be extended to cover the treatment of Neuroblastoma and Krabbe disease, which are among the 10 most common rare diseases afflicting young children in the world . She further added that patients with rare diseases outside the list of approved conditions and medication, unfortunately, face nothing but \u201cthe strictest of processes and a flat rejection\u201d.

Sponsors may voluntarily propose risk-sharing agreements with are captured through a legal deed of agreement that is negotiated between the sponsor and the Government. Some financial risk share agreements can be class deeds where sponsors share the risk based on market share. While such mutual agreements remain confidential, the majority of agreements are likely to be financial-based agreements which include price-volume, rebate or discount-based schemes . However, a hybrid of financial and outcome-based agreements is also possible .", "When considering reimbursement pathways for orphan drugs without alternatives, three potential pathways exist. The pharmacoeconomic evaluation exemption pathway was introduced since May 2015 to improve patient accessibility for anticancer and orphan drugs . For orphan drugs classified as essential drugs (ED) or falling under pharmacoeconomic waiver (PEW) categories, submission of a pharmacoeconomic study is not necessary. Instead, these drugs can be listed by referencing the listed prices of the same drug in the A7 countries (which includes the US, the UK, Italy, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and France). For ED drugs, the average adjusted price in the A7 country sets the reimbursable price, while for PEW drugs, it is the lowest price among the adjusted A7 country prices . ED classification hinges on meeting four criteria: alternative availability, disease severity, patient count, and clinical efficacy", "A rare disease is characterized by its low prevalence within the population. In the United States (US), a disease is classified as rare if it impacts fewer than 200,000 individuals . In contrast, Japan sets this threshold at 50,000 individuals, while Australia defines a rare disease as one affecting fewer than 2,000 individuals. These criteria generally correspond to prevalences ranging from 1 to 8 per 10,000 people . Singapore\u2019s definition specifies a rare disease as one affecting less than one in 2,000 patients . A significant number of rare diseases lead to fatal outcomes, and the majority have their roots in genetics, stemming from mutations in genes or chromosomes .", ". However, the extent of financial support available through these avenues for such individuals remains limited and subjected to annual caps.", "South Korea", ". The policy\u2019s focus on collective action and shared responsibility mirrors the core principles of the \u201cMany Helping Hands\u201d approach, a community-based framework that encourages collaboration among stakeholders to address social welfare issues .", "This scoping review thus aimed to compare and contrast the approaches to funding rare disease treatments across high-performing health systems in Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US. By examining the existing policies, approval processes, and reimbursement mechanisms in these countries, this review seeks to identify best practices, learning points and potential areas for improvement in ensuring equitable access to treatment for patients with rare diseases. In addressing rare diseases, it is crucial to establish a suitable financing structure to avoid creating a schism between families who can afford these treatments and those who cannot. This also raises a parallel question on whether the price of rare disease therapies is justified, and how health systems can provide equitable treatment access for all patients, regardless of the rarity of their condition and the cost of treatment.\nMethods\nCountry selection", "Blankart CR, Stargardt T, Schrey\u00f6gg J.

An important driver for uncertainty is the sustainability of remission, as it could range from 1 year to life-long effects. A risk-sharing agreement approach involves the government or healthcare providers negotiating with drug manufacturers to agree on terms that link the payment for the drugs to their performance in the real world or to specific outcomes. Given the paucity of long-term effectiveness data for treatments for rare diseases, making future payments conditional on the actual health outcomes and cost savings achieved would be a financially prudent approach for governments", "In terms of government-funded health insurance programs (Medicaid and Medicare), they provide coverage for certain individuals, including those with disabilities and the elderly. They may cover some treatments for rare diseases, depending on the state and specific policy details.

Introducing dozens of similar therapies into the market would strain health care systems and create difficult financial decisions for private insurers.\n[Over 110,000 readers rely on The Conversation\u2019s newsletter to understand the world.

In the short term, it\u2019ll be important to develop new payment methods that entice insurance companies to cover high-cost therapies and distribute risks across patients, insurance companies and drugmakers. In the long run, improved gene therapy technology will inevitably help lower costs.\nFor innovative payment models, one tested approach is tying coverage to patient health outcomes. Since these therapies are still experimental and relatively new, there isn\u2019t much data to help insurers make the risky decision of whether to cover them.

Firstly, the cost of developing a new drug or therapy, including gene therapy, is incredibly high due to the lengthy and complex process of research, clinical trials, and approval by regulatory bodies. According to a study published in the Journal of Health Economics, the average cost of bringing a new drug to market is estimated to be over $2.5 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the high cost of gene therapy is also attributed to the specialized technology and expertise required for its development and delivery. Gene therapy involves manipulating and altering the genetic makeup of an individual, which requires advanced technologies and specialized medical professionals. This significantly adds to the overall cost of research and development.\n\nAdditionally, the limited patient pool for rare diseases also plays a role in the high cost of gene therapy. As these diseases affect a small population, pharmaceutical companies may see less financial incentive to invest in their research and development. This creates a conflict between economic interests and patient well-being, raising ethical concerns.\n\nMoreover, the pricing of gene therapies is also influenced by regulatory policies and insurance coverage. In the United States, the high cost of healthcare and prescription drugs is a major concern, and the government plays a limited role in regulating drug prices. This leads to pharmaceutical companies having more control over the pricing of gene therapies.\n\nIn summary, the high research and development costs for gene therapies targeting rare diseases are a result of multiple factors, including the complexity and specialized nature of the therapy, limited patient population, and regulatory policies. To address these challenges, it is important for research to focus on understanding the financial models of pharmaceutical companies and exploring potential policy shifts that could incentivize investment in rare disease treatments.", "user_utterance": "Could you explain the key factors that contribute to the high research and development costs for gene therapies targeting rare diseases?", "search_queries": ["What are the reasons for the high costs of developing gene therapies for rare diseases?", "What are the main challenges faced by pharmaceutical companies when developing treatments for rare diseases?", "How do economic considerations affect the development of gene therapies for rare diseases?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://elsihub.org/collection/paying-cures-ethics-and-economics-gene-therapies-rare-diseases", "description": "Rare diseases, most of which have a genetic basis, collectively affect an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

As a result, there was a shift in priorities away from traditional outsourcing methods, towards insourcing teams to maximise laboratory space and equipment without excess cost.\nMeanwhile, technology-enabled clinical trials are growing in popularity; these decentralised trials are powered by smart devices and enable research to continue without increasing patient risk over COVID.", "This competitive environment results in a joint focus between both identifying novel hits, and developing new ways to enable traditionally intractable targets. Accelerating the discovery and optimisation of high-quality disease-relevant starting points means evolving traditional screening systems and translational assays to minimise late-stage drug attrition.\nWhile traditional outsourcing methods support with the workload involved across the drug discovery process, they can put IP at risk, as well as raise overall costs. Technological advances such as AI software for hit identification can provide accurate, efficient support.\nHowever, there remain barriers to successful digital implementation, an industry-led review sponsored by the UK government, reveals that data security, IP theft and cybersecurity remain key barriers to digital success.\n3.

Historically, major supporters of research like the National Institutes of Health, pharmaceutical industry and private foundations funded studies on the most common conditions, like heart disease, diabetes and mental health disorders. A breakthrough therapy would help millions of people, and a small markup per dose would generate hefty profits.\nAs a consequence, research on rare diseases was not well-funded for decades because it would help fewer people and the costs of each dose had to be very high to turn a profit.

Several factors determine which avenues of drug discovery that people in research and pharmaceutical companies focus on.\nFunding drives research decisions", "The passage of the Orphan Drug Act changed this trend by offering tax credits, research incentives and prolonged patent lives for companies actively developing drugs for rare diseases. From 1983 to 2019, 724 drugs were approved for rare diseases.\nEmerging social issues or opportunities can significantly affect funding available to develop drugs for certain diseases. When COVID-19 raged across the world, funding from Operation Warp Speed led to vaccine development in record time. Public awareness campaigns such as the ALS ice bucket challenge can also directly raise money for research.

Even though there are several drug options available for this condition, there is an ongoing need for more effective and less toxic drugs that reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\nIn 1989, epidemiologists found that patients with higher levels of bad, or LDL, cholesterol had more heart attacks and strokes than those with lower levels. Currently, 86 million American adults have elevated cholesterol levels that can be treated with drugs, like the popular statins Lipitor (atorvastatin) or Crestor (rosuvastatin). However, statins alone cannot get everyone to their cholesterol goals, and many patients develop unwanted symptoms limiting the dose they can receive.", "The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\nPrescription drugs and vaccines revolutionized health care, dramatically decreasing death from disease and improving quality of life across the globe.

Companies can charge more money for drugs that dramatically reduce deaths or disability than for those that only reduce symptoms. And researchers are more likely to continue working on drugs that have a greater potential to help patients. In order to obtain FDA approval, companies ultimately need to show that the drug causes more benefits for patients than harms.\nSometimes, researchers know a lot about a disease, but available technology is insufficient to produce a successful drug. For a long time, scientists knew that sickle cell disease results from a defective gene that leads cells in the bone marrow to produce poorly formed red blood cells, causing severe pain and blood clots. Scientists lacked a way to fix the issue or to work around it with existing methods.", "To create breakthrough treatments, researchers need a basic understanding of what disease processes they need to enhance or block. This requires developing cell and animal models that can simulate human biology.\nIt can take many years to vet potential treatments and develop the finished drug product ready for testing in people. Once scientists identify a potential biological target for a drug, they use high-throughput screening to rapidly assess hundreds of chemical compounds that may have a desired effect on the target. They then modify the most promising compounds to enhance their effects or reduce their toxicity.", "However, in the early 1990s, basic scientists discovered that bacterial cells have a mechanism to identify and edit DNA. With that model, researchers began painstaking work developing a technology called CRISPR to identify and edit genetic sequences in human DNA.\nThe technology finally progressed to the point where scientists were able to successfully target the problematic gene in patients with sickle cell and edit it to produce normally functioning red blood cells. In December 2023, Casgevy became the first CRISPR-based drug approved by the FDA.\nSickle cell disease made a great target for this technology because it was caused by a single genetic issue. It was also an attractive disease to focus on because it affects around 100,000 people in the U.S. and is costly to society, causing many hospitalizations and lost days of work. It also disproportionately affects Black Americans, a population that has been underrepresented in medical research.\nReal-world drug development", "Based on the market, companies and researchers tend to study highly prevalent diseases with devastating societal consequences, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and opioid use disorder.

Unsurprisingly, big pharma has brought the fight against those regulations to the courts.\nLowering prescription drug prices is a high priority for current US President Joe Biden as well. His administration made reining in prescription drug prices an important part of the Build Back Better plan. Although that bill eventually failed, the successful Inflation Reduction Act picked up the torch for lowering prescription drug prices, specifically for seniors and Medicare recipients. While Republicans have vowed to repeal the act, Biden has countered that he could veto the repeal.", "The US is the world's leader in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D).

It's up to drug companies to make sure processes such as enrolling patients and gathering and submitting trial results are done correctly.\nEach clinical trial has a different length, study participation and purpose, but this begins even before a drug is in a clinical trial. After drug discovery and initial development, the drug is moved into preclinical research before it can be tested on humans.\nAll of this is to say that investors should be ready to play the long game when it comes to investing in pharma companies.

This is now changing. Factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, geopolitics, new therapeutic modalities, and new ways of working make it vital for pharmacos to carefully reconsider their long-term choices in sourcing, manufacturing, and supply chain.\nNow is exactly the right time for this renewed emphasis on operations strategy, as pharmacos emerge from two years of intense firefighting. Succeeding in pharma under these new and challenging conditions will require succeeding in operations.\nThe focus for operational leaders may need to shift from the prevailing emphasis on continuous improvement\u2014including cost savings, quality assurance, and constant readiness to deliver\u2014to longer-term external challenges. These include high inflation and an increase in complexity and risk, as well as the compounding effects these forces have on each other.", "Pharma operations leaders now have an opportunity to deliver even greater value to their organizations by achieving this shift in focus, but they must act quickly to keep abreast of the challenges confronting the industry. The effort will require enormous mobilization and thoughtful prioritization. This task will fall to leadership; only the CEO and head of operations are in the right positions to make it happen.\nThis article explores the challenges facing pharma leaders and the steps they can take to develop a more strategic, long-term, and integrated approach to operations strategy. It presents questions leaders can ask as they design the solutions needed to make sure operations can protect enterprise continuity while still delivering to patients.\nA perfect storm of external challenges", "The pharma industry is facing a multitude of challenging trends (Exhibit 1). Global demand is growing rapidly, and the unprecedented need for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has put additional pressure on the industry. The industry\u2019s ability to find innovative solutions to deliver COVID-19 vaccines while still meeting overall demand is a remarkable achievement, but rising global demand is still a significant challenge for the industry in the long term.\nThe product landscape also is changing swiftly. New modalities, such as cell and gene therapy and mRNA vaccine technology, have increased from 11 to 21 percent of the drug development pipeline\u2014the fastest growth ever seen in the sector. This change is likely to bring more fragmentation of technology, new supply chains, and unique product life cycles.", "In addition to these industry-specific trends, pharma has also been affected by broader global trends, such as supply chain pressures. While the pharma industry is considered somewhat protected by its high inventory levels and long-standing dual sourcing, over a given ten-year period, the likelihood of supply chain disruptions still represents a potential loss of 25 percent of EBITA. Inflation has risen in recent months to levels not seen for decades, leading to increasing costs for labor, raw materials, and transportation. This is over and above the persistent price pressures pharma is already facing, particularly in generics. Since pharma customers are not expected to fully absorb these cost increases, profit margins are under pressure.", "Meanwhile, increased state interventions and protectionist trade policies are creating new pressures on manufacturing networks and could drive increased regionalization. This would be a capital-intensive exercise: to regionalize just 10 percent of current vaccine trade in one particular geographical region, governments would need to invest an estimated $100 million.\nWould you like to learn more about our Operations Practice?\nThe pharma industry is also facing talent shortages linked to wider labor market trends, including the 20 percent increase in demand for STEM-related roles across the life sciences industry in the United States. The current pool of pharma digital talent is at least 14 percent lower than demand, and many companies are finding it challenging to recruit technical talent. Compounding this challenge is the rise of remote working, which has increased employee expectations for flexibility. In response, nearly all pharmacos are experimenting with hybrid working models.", "A few major trends point to an industry tailwind; one of them is the advancement of digital and analytics tools. Digital tools, robots, and sensors are becoming cheaper and easier to access, and they can be used to capture all manner of raw data. In addition, edge computing and cloud analytics are providing real-time optimization and transparency. Pharmacos are working to leverage the power of data to become more agile and resilient. However, to date, no pharmaco has emerged as a true global leader in this field.\nEach of these global trends represents significant challenges in and of itself, and the trends may be compounded and strengthened through their interactions. This compounding effect can add to the complexity of evaluating an effective strategic response.\nMajor implications for pharma", "These global trends have six major implications for pharmacos: rising operational complexity, increasing risk, shifting capability requirements, higher capital expenditure requirements, variable-cost increases, and opportunities for savings (Exhibit 2).\nOperations leaders may need to become comfortable navigating a more complex ecosystem as they respond to increased operational complexity. Risks may increase due to rising environmental, social, and governance (ESG) expectations and skills gaps, while new modalities and digital acceleration will also likely lead to a shift in capability requirements. This could necessitate reskilling and upskilling of staff, as well as a renewed focus on recruiting from outside of the pharma industry.", "From a cost perspective, the pharma industry may see significantly increased capital expenditure requirements related to the construction of new sites and new digital infrastructure. Increases are also likely in variable costs in areas such as raw materials, transportation, and employee attrition, reskilling, and salaries.\nFuture of pharma operations\nAlthough these implications are challenging, they may represent possible opportunities for savings in several areas. For example, ESG commitments on waste reduction could reduce costs, as could successful digital implementation. However, the challenge lies in monetizing these cost savings, given that the industry has long created value largely through revenue expansion rather than through cost savings.\nRising to the challenge: Actions to deliver value", "To respond to these challenges, pharmaco leaders may now need to emphasize the importance of their operations strategy. They should consider taking a longer-term view and scaling activity across four key themes: network strategy and resilience, digital, operating model, and talent.\nExpand focus on longer-term, transformative solutions\nOperations leaders can address these challenges through several short-term and long-term responses. For example, problems associated with a more unpredictable supply chain could be addressed with a short-term approach of increasing inventory or a long-term initiative to establish an end-to-end supply chain digital nerve center.", "Short-term levers can be an important part of the total response but are insufficient to fully mitigate the challenges facing the industry. To respond effectively, companies may need to accelerate new ways of working and embrace long-term thinking. This will require concrete action with a focus on making sure that strategies are put in place to weather the long-term headwinds the industry is facing.\nAccelerate and scale responses across four strategic domains\nTo identify the actions that pharmacos could take, it may help to group these in terms of four strategic domains: network and resilience, digital strategy, operating model and ecosystem, and talent strategy (Exhibit 3). While these themes are likely to be familiar to any business leader, they now require a substantial shift in mindset. Acting on them also calls for a large investment of resources.", "- Plan for and manage future resilience and reliability needs. Recent supply chain disruptions have pushed supply chain resilience up corporate agendas. Companies have been forced into reactive modes that employ short-term levers like building inventory. However, companies could better position themselves by solving multiple variables and building resilience into their operations strategy through longer-term actions like network design and dual sourcing.", "- Scale end-to-end adoption of digital and automation. Digital has proven itself highly valuable to pharma operations. However, many companies struggle to move from targeted, single use cases to a fully scaled suite of solutions. And while the adoption of full-scale digital solutions can require heavy investment\u2014around $50 million to $100 million per year for two to three years\u2014the rewards can include significant cost savings, improved quality, and increased resilience, as well as greater employee effectiveness. Companies that truly scale and implement digital can better protect themselves from the pressures of the forces increasing costs for the industry. More and more companies are moving toward network-wide and end-to-end digitization; to date, the World Economic Forum has recognized 103 as \u201clighthouses,\u201d based on their advanced application of digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has successfully launched multiple Industry 4", ".0 lighthouses, including some focused on end-to-end patient connectivity and order fulfillment.", "- Expand adoption of end-to-end partner ecosystems. Companies could also consider changing their operating model from a traditional hub configuration around originators to an end-to-end ecosystem of true strategic partners. More than 50 percent of companies already expect to intensify their collaboration models with other industry players through, for example, service agreements, joint ventures, or ecosystems. Some are already in motion; examples include Pfizer and BioNTech, which have already established a strategic partnership in mRNA technology discovery, and AstraZeneca and Huma, which are collaborating to scale innovation for digital health. These partnerships are indicative of increasing collaborations throughout the industry across functions.", "- Embed talent strategy in operations strategy. Companies may also benefit from embedding strategic workforce planning into operations strategy, with a focus on reskilling, upskilling, and automation. The shortage of talent may mean shifting managers\u2019 perception of strategic workforce planning\u2014from \u201cenabler\u201d to a core element of operations strategy. This could entail moving away from the traditional approach of HR-driven recruiting and training and toward planning the workforce more strategically with long-term goals in mind.\nAutomation, centralization, and new job requirements may affect nearly 90 percent of today\u2019s workforce, and to deal with this challenge, companies could adopt effective long-term strategies. Retaining talent is challenging in the present environment, with the share of workers planning to leave their jobs in the next three to six months standing at 40 percent since 2021.1 Strategies for talent retention should therefore be broad and focus on more than just salary.", "A viable long-term solution to talent shortages may need to involve more than increasing wages to attract people. To solve structural talent gaps, companies could ensure long-term reskilling and upskilling of the existing workforce. For example, Roche runs an operations rotational program to attract top talent with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, and early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Novartis launched a \u201cchoice with responsibility\u201d policy to improve overall employee experience.\nSuccessfully developing a robust operations strategy is complex and requires dedicated resources with the ability to focus on the medium to long term. This means the C-suite will need to prioritize efforts and provide adequate resourcing. Only the CEO and head of operations can set the appropriate direction for their organization, steer their company\u2019s effort, gather the right skills and teams, and manage complex interdependencies and resource-intensive interventions.\nAre companies doing enough?", "As COOs look to emerge from the disruption of the past two years, reflecting on several questions could help them evaluate their organizations\u2019 level of preparedness to respond to the trends affecting the industry. The process could provide foundational answers to inform a renewed operations strategy.\n- Have you projected the impact of today\u2019s current trends on your business?\n- Do you have a focused, skilled, and scaled operations strategy team that identifies, prioritizes, and deploys initiatives across different horizons?\n- Are your resilience measures proactive and dynamic, and are they being built on talent and digital capabilities to achieve greater agility and reliability?\n- Have you experienced greater access to innovation and flexibility as a result of expanding your services and strategic partnerships?\n- Has your digital strategy created benefits across your network and transformed your operation from digitally enabled to digitally driven?", "- Have you achieved ESG improvements, and do you have a broad, long-term road map for ESG commitments (beyond net zero)?\n- Has your operating model been agile enough to adapt to rapidly changing operations requirements, such as new modalities and potential disruptions?\n- Have you successfully transformed your operations workforce and comprehensively improved the employee experience?\n- Do you have an established governance process that incorporates past lessons into future strategy?\nAlthough the pharma industry has performed a remarkable feat in delivering COVID-19 vaccines while also meeting growing demand, current trends create a challenging environment for pharmaceutical companies. Companies face greater costs, complexity, and risk.", "Now is the time to rethink operational strategy to respond to these trends and remain competitive. Such change may have associated challenges and will require bold and innovative leadership.

Biopharma companies will continue to develop new ways to treat and cure a wide range of diseases. However, actionable health insights, driven by radically interoperable data and artificial intelligence (AI), can help clinicians and consumers identify illness much earlier than we do today. Vaccines and other early interventions could prevent a greater number of diseases from developing in the first place. Other illnesses might be prevented through nonpharmacological treatments. Shifts in how diseases are identified, prevented, treated, or cured may lead to fundamentally different business models for traditional biopharma companies and new entrants.\nExplore the health care collection\nLearn about Deloitte\u2019s services", "Go straight to smart. Get the Deloitte Insights app.\nResearchers from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions interviewed 14 thought leaders (futurists, venture capitalists, digital health leaders, and academics) to find out how they expected the identification, prevention, and treatment of disease to evolve between now and 2040. Through these interviews, five forces emerged that could alter the course of the biopharmaceutical sector. These forces represent both opportunities and threats to incumbents. They include prevention and early detection, custom treatments and personalized medicine, curative therapies, digital therapeutics, and precision intervention. Interviewees noted that disruption is already taking place in the industry, and they tried to project where those threats might lead over the next 20 years.", "The forces of change highlighted in this paper are likely to reshape, if not shrink, the market for biopharma products. Biopharma companies should consider the potential for disruption by these forces as they redefine the types of products and solutions they will offer, where they will compete, and the new capabilities they will require. Company leaders should develop strategies to counter potential threats and take advantage of the short- and long-term opportunities that emerge in this changing environment. Organizations that ignore these forces and maintain the status quo could wind up shrinking in parallel to the demand for drug interventions to manage symptomatic diseases.", "The future of health that we envision in 2040 will be a world apart from what we have now. Based on emerging technology, we can be reasonably certain that digital transformation\u2014enabled by radically interoperable data, AI, and open, secure platforms\u2014will drive much of this change. Unlike today, we believe care will be organized around the consumer, rather than around the institutions that drive our existing health care system.", "By 2040 (and perhaps beginning much before), streams of health data\u2014together with data from a variety of other relevant sources\u2014will likely merge to create a multifaceted and highly personalized picture of every consumer\u2019s well-being. Many digital health companies are already beginning to incorporate always-on biosensors and software into devices that can generate, gather, and share data. Advanced cognitive technologies could be developed to analyze a significantly large set of parameters and create personalized insights into a consumer\u2019s health. The availability of data and personalized AI can enable precision well-being and real-time microinterventions that allow us to get ahead of sickness and far ahead of catastrophic disease. By 2040, health is likely to revolve around preventing some diseases from happening, and curing others. Many fewer people would have long-term conditions with continued need for medication to treat symptoms.1", "In this future of health, the era of blockbuster drugs that treat large populations will likely wane. Instead, the biopharma sector is on the fringe of an era where hypertailored therapies are developed to cure or prevent disease rather than treat symptoms. Twenty years from now, rather than picking up a prescription at the pharmacy, personalized therapies based on a diverse set of a patient\u2019s characteristics including their genomics, metabolome, microbiome, and other clinical information might be manufactured or compounded just in time through additive manufacturing.\nHow might exponential advancements in science and technology impact biopharma companies? What are some examples of disruption already happening in the market, and how quickly is change likely to occur? To find out, researchers from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions conducted interviews with 14 forward-thinking industry experts (for more details see the sidebar, \u201cMethodology\u201d).", "The Deloitte Center for Health Solutions conducted telephone interviews with 14 industry experts including researchers, academics, futurists, investors, and former biopharmaceutical company executives from September to December of 2019. In addition, we conducted secondary research to identify startups and established companies that are already beginning to disrupt the biopharma sector.", "A note to readers: This research was conducted before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) became a focus for drug and vaccine development. At the time of publication, academic and biopharma researchers were increasing data transparency, leveraging accelerated regulatory pathways, and setting up adaptive trials to develop and test drugs and vaccines to address the pandemic. It is too early to opine on the timing and impact of those activities and how the forces we describe in this paper might accelerate or change how biopharma responds to pandemics in the future. We look forward to reporting about innovative approaches and lessons learned from this situation.", "Our interviews confirmed that five forces are beginning to impact biopharma companies but are likely to disrupt the sector more dramatically in the years ahead. Most of our interviewees agreed with our vision for the future of health that these forces\u2014driven by players inside and outside of the biopharma sector\u2014could have a seismic impact on biopharmaceutical companies and the patients they serve. The five forces, listed in order of potential disruption to the traditional scope of the biopharma industry, are:\nPrevention and early detection: Vaccines and improvements in wellness could help prevent disease, making treatment for some diseases no longer necessary. Advances in early detection will likely enable interventions that halt diseases in the earliest stages\u2014before they progress to more serious conditions.", "Customized treatments: Personalization in medicine\u2014driven by data-powered insights\u2014could effectively match patients with customized drug cocktails, or design therapies that would work for just a few people, or even a particular person (i.e., \u201cn of 1\u201d).\nCurative therapies: As with prevention, treatments that cure disease could reduce or eliminate the demand for some prescription medicines. Developing, marketing, and pricing these curative treatments could require the biopharma sector to adopt new capabilities.\nDigital therapeutics: Increasingly effective and scalable nonpharmaceutical (digital) interventions\u2014including those focused on behavior modification\u2014might also reduce or eliminate demand for medications.\nPrecision intervention: Increasingly sophisticated medical technology\u2014such as precise medical intervention enabled by robotics, nanotechnology, or tissue engineering\u2014could reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention.", "As we move toward the future of health, biopharma incumbents should consider new strategic investments to position themselves for success. The changes that we see on the horizon will likely require biopharma companies to consider new types of markets, alternative business models, or a complete change in how they define what work they do.\nPrevention of disease and a shift to wellness is a core pillar of Deloitte\u2019s perspective on the future of health. We expect that over the next 20 years, we will be able to detect some diseases\u2014and prevent them from advancing\u2014possibly even before symptoms surface. Today, for example, clinicians can detect the early stages of melanoma much earlier than in the past, and early treatment can eliminate the disease completely. Not intervening until it metastasizes results in complications and expensive treatments. Early detection of other types of cancer could reduce or eliminate the need for future therapies.", "Our interviewees suggested that other chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, might be treated more effectively if they are identified early. They also noted that earlier detection of a disease\u2014or an understanding that a disease might be avoidable\u2014could motivate people to adopt healthier lifestyles.", "Vaccines: Vaccines are being developed that include but expand beyond childhood or common infectious diseases. In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine to prevent the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cervical cancer.2 If used widely enough, the vaccine could substantially reduce and potentially eliminate cervical cancer. Two other examples of virally transfused cancers include the human T-lymphotropic virus type 3 (HTLV-3) and the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer. Over the next 20 years, more vaccines could be developed that prevent more types of cancer. The industry is beginning to think differently about the impact vaccines could have on other types of cancer by using the patient\u2019s own immunity against self-antigens that are expressed in tumor cells. While these too are vaccines, they bear no resemblance to vaccines that prevent an infectious agent.", "In the years ahead, the delivery of vaccines could move away from the traditional syringe as a delivery device. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a study that showed how an influenza vaccine could produce an effective immune response through a bandage strip lined with a patch of painless microneedles that are just long enough to penetrate the skin. The needles, which are painless, dissolve minutes after the vaccine is delivered and the bandage can be thrown away.3 In the future, such patches could be mailed directly to patients who could administer a vaccine themselves, increasing access and adoption.", "Genetic testing: Whole-genome sequencing is a powerful and revolutionary tool. In fact, the genetic testing market is expected to reach US$17.6 million by 2025 with a CAGR of 11.3 percent.4 Early detection of a disease, or the ability to determine who might be genetically predisposed to a disease, could make it possible to cure an illness in the early stages or prevent it altogether. As gene sequencing, our ability to interpret the data, and gene-editing tools become more sophisticated, we expect to see an increase in early detection and preventative or curative interventions.\nSome of our interviewees noted that the ability to use genetic information to identify patients at risk for developing disease could create an opportunity for biopharma companies.\n\u201cIt is conceivable that if biopharma companies, NIH, academia, and others don\u2019t ramp up their ability to cure disease, we could have a population of people who have an early diagnosis but no cure.\u201d\u2014Academic researcher", "There was also some discussion that our ever-growing knowledge of genetic risks could lead to under- or over-treatment. Case in point: In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that seven women from the same family underwent major surgeries after a genetic test determined they all had an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.5 Since then, we\u2019ve learned the increased risk associated with this particular gene is not quite as high as previously thought. The surgeries, which led to complications, might not have been necessary.", "Early detection: Emerging technologies could dramatically improve our ability to detect disease in its earliest stages. For example, the home bathroom of the future might include a smart toilet that uses always-on sensors to test nitrites, glucose, protein, and pH for possible infections or disease. AI might be used to spot biomarkers that would indicate a potential change in health status before symptoms appear. Technology embedded in a bathroom mirror might be able to distinguish a mole from melanoma.\nWe are already seeing advancements in the ability to detect the early stages of cancer. A liquid biopsy, for example, can help identify cancer cells by testing a sample of blood. At a 2019 conference, California-based Grail presented data that it said confirms its ability to detect early-stage cancer with a single blood test. The company said it detected strong signals for 12 cancers with a 99 percent specificity rate.6", "Nutrition and microbiome: Everyone has a unique microbiome, and researchers are just beginning to understand the relationship between these tiny organisms and how they influence mental and physical health. In 2018, the global human microbiome market was valued at US$351.81 million,7 and over 100 companies are investing in analyzing data related to the microbiome.8\nThe estimated 38 trillion microorganisms that exist within our bodies can have an impact on physical and mental health, which gives new meaning to the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat.\u201d A better understanding of the microbiome could lead to more effective ways to prevent disease. Microbes found in the guts of children, for example, could be related to childhood diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes.9 Recent research also suggests that the microbiome could influence how susceptible a patient might be to certain types of cancer, or how a patient is likely to respond to immunotherapy.10", "Considerations:Our understanding of what drives disease is continually evolving, and some diseases don\u2019t have a clear underlying cause. As one interviewee pointed out, \u201cThere is no way to determine why some people develop rheumatoid arthritis and some people don\u2019t.\u201d But the groundwork is already being laid for a world with a greater ability to detect and prevent disease. Diagnostics, and their resulting data, are likely to become powerful tools going forward. Advanced analytics of data collected from diagnostics, combined with patient health records, could help identify patterns related to the causes and early markers of disease. Pharma companies should learn to leverage the insights that come from these technologies to develop pathways and treatments for early intervention.", "The way individuals express disease and respond to treatment varies greatly. The vast majority of patients may not receive the full potential benefit of drugs that they are treated with because we don\u2019t yet know how to effectively stratify patient populations, one interviewee noted. A therapy that is effective for one patient, might be metabolized differently by another patient and never reach the optimal active concentration, he noted. Giving each patient a personalized dosage, or the optimal combination of drugs, could lead to better outcomes.", "We define a customized treatment as a single therapy, or mix of therapies, that is selected, tailored, or developed to treat an individual. This requires leveraging data to identify the best drug treatment option (single or combination therapy), the right dosing, and possibly customizing treatment for an individual patient. Getting to this level of customization will likely require a wealth of data\u2014either through the use of real-world evidence (RWE) to effectively target or repurpose existing treatments\u2014or new clinical trial paradigms that help identify high responders and optimal dosing. Given the need for data, we envision that the early advances in personalized treatments will be seen with generic and late\u2013life cycle medications, which have a wealth of RWE available to inform the stratification of the disease, tailored dosing, and tailored regimens.", "Stratifying disease to target the best drug intervention: Advances in the understanding of biomarkers and genetic markers have helped researchers identify subpopulations within broader disease categories. Parkinson\u2019s disease, for example, has a number of clear genetic subsets and various mutations. It\u2019s actually a set of discrete diseases, and some variations of Parkinson\u2019s look different than others. In the future, we will likely be able to identify increasingly smaller subsets of patients based on genetic lesions, differences in protein expression, and the microbiome. Biopharma companies might be able to develop or target therapies to the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.", "Tailored dosing: Predictive analytics and the ability to analyze longitudinal and integrated data sets for diverse patient populations could help biopharma companies determine optimal dosing levels for patients, who is most likely to respond, and under what conditions. This data could help companies develop customized treatment regimens for specific types of patients.", "For example, data on how a patient metabolizes a drug could be used to ensure he/she gets the precise dose that will optimize effectiveness and minimize toxicity. The concept of pharmacogenomics has been around for a long time, but little progress has been made when it comes to using this information to determine effective dosing. Systematic evaluation of how patients metabolize drugs by evaluating the expression of liver enzymes (CYP450) or kidney function could enable more optimal dosing to get patients into therapeutic ranges. One interviewee said, \u201cPharmacogenomic data will become part of the electronic medical record.\u201d", "Tailored drug regimens: Clinicians of the future might be able to examine a range of biomarkers and genetic information\u2014as well as clinical and behavioral digital health data\u2014to determine the appropriate drug combinations for a patient. This could be similar to how doctors are now able to sequence tumors, identify mutations, and match the appropriate therapy in cancer patients.", "Further, additive manufacturing could lead to new ways of delivering drugs. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) could be combined at the point of care, allowing for customized therapies. One physician interviewee predicted, \u201cWe will be giving patients one pill with everything rather than a number of pills.\u201d She noted that this a common patient pain point that physicians often don\u2019t see. Case in point: In 2015, Spritam became the world\u2019s first 3D-printed drug approved by the FDA and was used to treat epilepsy. Further, startups such as FabRX are aiming to provide personalized medicines through 3D printing. FabRX\u2019s proprietary technology, Printlets, offers personalized dosages, polypills, chewable medicines, and fast-dissolving tablets.11", "Considerations: A proliferation of real-world data sources could help health care stakeholders understand which drugs work best for which patients and under which circumstances. Biopharma companies should be at the forefront of understanding heterogenous patient populations. However, being at the forefront will likely require significant investments in data and analytics capabilities. Companies should consider new drug-development paradigms, such as master protocols, that enable the evaluation of drugs alone or in combination in specified patient subpopulations.12 This shift toward increasingly customized treatments could have a significant impact on the biopharma supply chain. Smaller-volume therapies could require new manufacturing capabilities\u2014not just for branded manufacturers, but all generics (see the sidebar, \u201cThe future of generic drug manufacturing\u201d).", "About 90 percent of all prescription drug purchases are for generics, according to the IQVIA Institute. Unlike some high-cost therapies that treat a small portion of the population, the generic-drug business model is based entirely on high-volume treatments that target large populations. If more diseases are cured or prevented, the need for generic drugs that treat chronic diseases could be reduced significantly, which could disrupt the volume-based model. Increased focus on nutrition, for example, could mean fewer people have high cholesterol, which would translate to a smaller market for generic statins.", "If the future of health emerges in the way we expect it will, we could see some consolidation among generic-drug manufacturers. Most could benefit from developing a business model that focuses on more customized treatments. Manufacturers that are able to leverage prescribing and outcomes data for generic drugs may be well-positioned to match patients to appropriate therapies. Further, investment in additive manufacturing capabilities and distribution channels could enable companies to manufacture customized treatment combinations, and tailored doses. Manufacturers might also partner with consumer-focused retailers to develop customized drug packaging and distribute their products directly to patients. Some manufacturers might forge partnerships directly with health systems or consortiums to supply them with products.", "Curative therapies\u2014time-limited treatments that remove symptoms of a disease through the permanent (or semipermanent) correction of the underlying condition\u2014have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of many diseases. Several of our interviewees predicted that diseases driven by single genetic mutations (e.g., certain cancers, sickle cell anemia, and some rare diseases) are likely to be among the first ones treated by curative therapies. At the end of 2019, more than 1,000 clinical trials were being executed worldwide for cell and gene therapies (see figure 3).13 These trials are targeting a breadth of diseases including cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. While biopharma is at the forefront of developing these treatments, keeping pace with a rapidly changing environment will likely require new business models.", "Gene therapies: The first gene therapy in the United States was approved in 2019, and many more are in the pipeline. Most of these therapies target diseases driven by a single or a few genetic mutations. One interviewee said he expects to \u201csee cures for diseases that are well-defined by genetic mutations based on better gene therapy.\u201d Such diseases could include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, fragile X syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington\u2019s disease.\nOne academic researcher told us that we might be able to cure cancer subtypes that are caused by specific oncogenes passed down in families, such as BRCA. Gene replacement, for example, could replace prophylactic mastectomies. He cautioned that there are many safety concerns with this approach and said it could be difficult to replace the gene in all of a person\u2019s cancer-causing cells. Diseases that are cell nonautonomous might be more attractive, he added.", "Another interviewee told us that CRISPR has been used to destroy viruses and bacterial infections. He also said that CRISPR can be used to program bacteria to guard against other bacteria. For example, researchers at the Western University in London, Ontario, successfully used a CRISPR-associated enzyme called Cas9 to eliminate a species of Salmonella using E. coli bacteria. Scientists at the Broad Institute also recently published a study that demonstrated that another enzyme called Cas13 could be programmed to kill three different kinds of single-stranded RNA viruses.14 However, one CRISPR leader pointed out that gene editing might only address part of the problem for multifactor diseases. Drug therapy might still be required to manage other variables that drive disease expression.", "Cell therapies: Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy is driving research and development activity among many biopharma companies. The most publicized form of ACT (CAR-T) uses the patient\u2019s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. Two therapies using this technology have been approved in the United States, and many more are in development.15 These therapies could treat previously difficult-to-treat late-stage cancers and have led to high rates of remission. As researchers reduce the cost of making and delivering these therapies, and reduce or better manage toxicities, they could move upstream in treatment plans to become the standard of care.", "One interviewee suggested that applications of this technology could expand beyond oncology into autoimmune diseases. \u201cWe\u2019ll better understand where the immune system has been programmed up and learn to program it down using CAR-T,\u201d he said. He also suggested that we might be able to use gene and cell therapy to reprogram our bone marrow/immune system, but noted that it would be a \u201clonger, harder road with weird speed bumps.\u201d", "Another interviewee pointed out that stem cells are the raw materials for cellular therapies, similar to bone marrow. During the next 20 years, biopharma companies might get close to the process of sourcing these raw materials and could consider using them to treat disease. \u201cIn the future, we might be able to extract bone marrow from a young patient, store it, and use it to cure an autoimmune illness that we know is likely to develop in that person as they reach their 40s,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThis idea might be science fiction today, but 20 years from now, some pharmaceutical companies might have stem cell transplant centers.\u201d Magenta Therapeutics is an example of a company that is working on this today.", "Considerations: Curative therapies will likely require new business models that address the shift in cost from chronic treatment to a one-time treatment. The long-term health economic value of cures could be tremendous, but data will be needed to demonstrate value before widespread adoption can occur. Companies will likely need to develop sophisticated methods for monitoring post-treatment patients to help shape the value story. Questions about how the cost and benefits for a one-time curative treatment should be allocated need to be addressed. Lastly, companies might need to explore novel financing mechanisms to enable both access and affordability given that the short-duration treatment has the potential for a life time of benefit.", "Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based interventions to patients through software programs that help prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. This technology could be a viable alternative to traditional pharmacologic treatments, or used in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes. Digital therapeutics, for example, might use an app-based platform to target modifiable chronic diseases such as diabetes, depression, anxiety, and heart disease.", "Digital therapeutics that help make drug treatment more effective: Some digital therapeutics are helping patients take a more holistic approach to managing their disease, including combining drug treatments with nondrug treatments. For example, diabetes digital programs combine a blood-glucose monitor with actionable insights and personalized coaching. Real-time tracking of drug therapy and symptoms allow doctors and coaches to intervene and modify therapy before symptoms escalate. Some of these digital interventions have been FDA-approved and health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are paying for them. Express Scripts, for example, has established a digital formulary that evaluates digital interventions based on clinical research, usability, and financial value.16 Livongo\u2019s digital therapeutics for diabetes, prediabetes, and hypertension have received preferred formulary status (see the sidebar, \u201cNew digital therapeutics help patients manage their chronic diseases\u201d).", "Digital therapeutics that reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention: Digital therapeutics are increasing access to medical providers, which could reduce the need for drug treatments. For example, many digital therapeutics rely on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment that has been shown to improve patient outcomes across a range of mental health diseases. Virtual coaches, for example, can help patients modify behavior in the moment to reduce the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Sleepio, a digital treatment for insomnia that does not involve drug therapy, is one example that is covered by a PBM in lieu of pharmaceutical sleep agents. Some digital therapeutics are empowering patients to take charge of their symptoms for complex chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases (see the sidebar, \u201cNew digital therapeutics help patients manage their chronic diseases\u201d).", "From exercise to nutrition to meditation, consumers are paying closer attention to their well-being. The proliferation of fitness trackers, smart watches, and other wearables that track activity and sleep has moved quickly from early adoption a few years ago to the mainstream. According to Deloitte\u2019s 2019 Global Health Care Consumer Survey, 42 percent of US consumers rely on technology to measure their fitness levels and set health-improvement goals (figure 5).17 Patients are also increasingly interested in trying out homeopathic methods before turning to pharmaceuticals. Moreover, one of our interviewees suggested that physicians of the future might be writing prescriptions for healthy food18 and walks outside.19 This increased awareness of well-being, combined with digital therapeutics, could help consumers stay healthy.", "Considerations: The future of digital therapeutics depends on user adoption, the ability to demonstrate impact, and optimization of pricing/reimbursement. Some interviewees were skeptical of the long-term adoption, or stickiness, of digital therapeutics. While some patients might try the technology, they might lose interest after a few days or weeks. Our interviewees also cautioned that higher socioeconomic classes are more likely than lower classes to use these technologies, which could further widen health disparities. Other interviewees countered that if the digital experience is user-friendly, includes a human touch when necessary, incorporates storytelling (rather than commands), and truly understands the motivations for each patient (whether that be more free time, better health, or something else), adoption will likely continue to grow. Non-negotiable, however, is that these technologies need to demonstrate results", ". One interviewee suggested that the adoption of health care apps will likely reach a tipping point once major health systems, health plans, and large pharmacies \u201cprioritize digital therapeutics over prescriptions and pay for them.\u201d", "Sleepio: Sleepio, a digital sleep improvement program, was founded in 2010. Using cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques to address sleep disorders, the app strives to be entertaining as well as tailored to each user. A 2012 paper published in the trade journal Sleep determined Sleepio to be more effective than a placebo and helped 76 percent of users achieve healthy sleep levels.20 In a 2018 JAMA Psychiatry paper, about 75 percent of Sleepio users saw an improvement in sleep after going through the company\u2019s six-week program.21 These results spurred the United Kingdom\u2019s NHS to pay for the use of the app.22", "Livongo: Livongo, founded in 2008, is a digital health management app for chronic diseases. The platform focuses on multiple conditions, including diabetes, prediabetes, weight management, hypertension, and behavioral health. It aims to close gaps in care, provide refill deliveries, and personalize care through both its digital offering and access to real-time health specialists and coaches. In 2017, Livongo presented at the Annual American Diabetes Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions showing that it decreased costs by 5.8 percent compared to non-Livongo users, helping save US$83 per participant per month.23", "MyMee: The three-year-old digital care program focuses on chronic autoimmune disorders. It allows users to input and track their daily activities, and then make sense of any patterns in the data that might be impacting their health. It also connects users with a health coach. Anecdotal stories on MyMee\u2019s website highlight individuals who were able to learn about and understand the triggers that are negatively impacting their bodies. In response, they were able to change their diets and lifestyle habits to avoid those triggers.", "More sophisticated medical technology might enable earlier interventions and more effective procedures that reduce or even eliminate the need for pharmaceutical management. This includes advances in robotic surgery, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering. Some of our interviewees suggested that as these technologies become more sophisticated, they could lead to dramatically improved outcomes in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory conditions, and chronic pain.", "Robotic surgery: Historically, the scope of surgeries has been limited by the clumsiness of human hands, requiring drug therapy to manage the remaining disease. Robotic surgery is now the standard of care for many procedures, and medtech companies are investing in technology to advance capabilities including integrating them with augmented/virtual reality, AI, advanced analytics, and other emerging technologies. In the future, previously inoperable sites might be reachable, which could increase the efficacy of these platforms. For example, cancer patients who have hard-to-reach tumors have historically been treated with systemic therapies and radiation. Advances in robotic surgery have made it possible to remove a tumor wrapped around the spinal cord, for example, and eliminate or reduce the need for chemotherapy.", "Nanotechnology: Microscopic nanotechnology particles have the potential to enter diseased tissues and deliver more targeted and precise medical interventions. One of our interviewees said, \u201cWe will have an active nanomechanical system that can go through and do different things in the body, like replace tissues and cell types.\u201d Case in point: A team of scientists at the University of California, San Diego, created \u201cnanosponges\u201d that can go through the body and remove toxins from bacterial pathogens and inflammatory conditions.24 Nanotechnology might even evolve to include living cells. Researchers at the University of Vermont and Tufts University have designed organic robots by joining together specific types of stem cells taken from a well-studied species of African frog, Xenopus laevis. They suggest that bots derived in a similar manner, using the person\u2019s own cells, could be injected into the bloodstream to remove plaque from artery walls.25", "3D printing and tissue engineering: Manufacturers and clinicians could use 3D printing to create highly customized, low-cost medical technology products that are tailored to each patient\u2019s unique physiology. Everything from prosthetics to skin for burn victims to organs to implants (dental and orthopedic) can be produced through 3D printing. In some applications, 3D printing offers solutions where none existed. For example, airway splints for babies with tracheobronchomalacia (a rare condition where the tracheal or windpipe cartilage is soft) can be created by a 3D printer.26", "Tissue engineering\u2014in combination with additive manufacturing\u2014could be used to restore damaged tissues. One interviewee noted that we\u2019d likely start there, and then we\u2019d harvest organs. He suggested that at some point in the future, patients might be presented with multiple options to treat tissue or organ dysfunction. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to fix it, regenerate tissue, or grow replacements, perhaps through xenotransplantation,\u201d he predicted. Advances in this technology could fix chronic diseases, eliminating the need for ongoing drug therapy. Case in point: Researchers at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital tissue-engineered human pancreatic islets in a laboratory. The engineered tissue develops a circulatory system, secretes hormones such as insulin, and has successfully treated sudden-onset Type 1 diabetes in mice.27", "Considerations: These technologies could be highly disruptive to biopharmaceutical companies by eliminating the need for drug therapy. These interventions might be poised to reduce the need for major classes of drugs such as chemotherapy, insulin, and drugs for inflammatory conditions. Biopharma companies working in impacted disease areas should consider adopting some of these technologies, or risk operating in a much smaller market in the future.", "The five forces described above should push biopharma companies to ask themselves some hard questions about the markets they are in and how the threat of disruption could impact them. The current model of selling therapies that treat symptoms or mitigate the progression of chronic diseases is no longer viable. Sales volumes for drugs across disease areas are likely to decline due to more effective prevention, greater stratification of disease, better tailoring of drug regimens for patients, an increase in curative therapies, behavioral intervention, and advanced medical procedures.\nIn the face of these five forces, biopharma companies should ask themselves:", "By 2040, some diseases will be prevented, cured, or managed with nonpharmacological interventions. If that vision is correct, we could have fewer people with chronic diseases and less need for therapies that treat those conditions. As a result, what has historically been in-bounds for the pharma sector\u2014such as the treatment of chronic diseases\u2014could erode. \u201cIf pharma wants to survive, they should broaden themselves significantly,\u201d said one former executive of a global pharmaceutical company.\nWhen we look back on the sector 20 years from now, we may describe our current approach to disease and treatments as crude.

Over the past five years, the FDA has granted an average of 60 novel drug approvals annually (including Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, approvals), encompassing a broad spectrum of technologies beyond just CGTs. If this trend persists, one could expect that less than a quarter of the forecasted approvals for CGTs come to fruition in 2024. This disparity between optimistic forecasts and historical approval rates should not be viewed as negative but rather a reminder of the scrutiny, scientific and clinical validation and the market readiness that these products must meet. This high bar, while tempering approval rates, is a testament to the industry\u2019s commitment to delivering transformative therapies to patients.", "Despite these challenges, funding has shown resilience, staying relatively steady through 2023; however, PE and VC investors are being more selective, focusing on companies with longer cash runways, proven success in early-stage trials, and alternative income sources, such as licensing and collaboration deals.\nFor CGT companies, having diverse income streams, particularly through licensing and collaboration, can be a significant advantage. Per Evaluate, in 2023, CGTs accounted for 19% of licensing and collaboration agreements, even though they were only 10% of novel approvals and PE and VC investment.

As public markets adjust and the economy recovers through 2022, we anticipate cell and gene companies to return to a more metered growth trajectory that is supported by an increasing number of clinical catalysts and hopefully more regulatory approvals.\nThe takeaway for cell and gene companies and their investors is that it is important to separate hype from science. This is an emerging space with a massive potential opportunity, but until commercially proven, it still bears a significant amount of risk.\nSource: Bloomberg\nSource: Evaluate Pharma", "That said, the biggest manufacturing challenge is not a lack of lab space or production capacity. As new therapies are approved, a significant determinant of success will depend on whether the treatments are allogenic (based on cells from a donor) or autologous (based on cells from the patient). Treatments based on allogenic cells fit into a more traditional model of having treatment available for distribution as needed, whereas autologous treatments require modifying cells from the patients themselves to return as a treatment. This means that each dose must be made to order, introducing significant complexity and cost in treatment planning, manufacturing, and the overall supply chain.\n- Pressure to closely follow the early clinical success", "One of the largest outstanding challenges facing cell and gene therapies is that of reimbursement. Currently, the number of therapies and the volume of patients being treated is small enough that payers are willing to accept complicated and experimental approaches to reimbursements, including annuity and installment-based payments and outcomes-based reimbursement.

Headwinds exist in the form of higher interest rates, labor shortages, less funding for research-stage companies, and regulatory changes. Commercial-stage organizations appear unfaltering while research-stage companies are tossed by the seas of uncertainty. While this may sound stark for cell and gene therapy (CGT) companies, which are primarily research-stage, these companies are well equipped to navigate these challenges.\nIn this article, we will discuss the state of the macroeconomy, its effects on CGT companies, and the unique prospects that many of these companies have compared to the broader life sciences market.\nA Quick Recap On The State Of The Macroeconomy", "Interest rates haven\u2019t been this high since the periods preceding the early 2000s recession and the Great Recession in 2008. While each of these periods had different drivers, they all ultimately resulted in depressed valuations and a subsequent period of recovery. In our current economic cycle, depressed valuations have significantly harmed funding for research-stage companies, including CGT companies. In the funding section of this article, we\u2019ll discuss this recovery period and the real challenges ahead for the transitional year we believe 2024 will be.\nSource: Bloomberg; RSM US LLP", "While the prior periods of high interest rates resulted in subsequent recessions, the current economy has remained robust in terms of gross domestic product growth, strong labor markets, and consumer spending. Given these factors, it is possible that we will avoid a recession and achieve a \u201csoft landing.\u201d This translates directly into less restrictive financial conditions, which should support investor confidence and a higher risk appetite to aid continued support for research and development in life sciences.\nCell And Gene Therapies\u2019 Growing Approval Pipeline\nThe approval pipeline for CGT continues to grow. Per Evaluate, CGT made up 10% of all U.S. FDA novel approvals in 2023, up from 7% and 6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. With increasing groundbreaking approvals, such as the first CRISPR-based therapeutic approved for marketing in the U.S., there is significant traction going into 2024 and beyond.", "These approvals also reflect the complexity and diversity of therapies in development. Per Evaluate, approximately two-thirds of the approvals in 2023 were for DNA and RNA therapeutics or gene therapies, with the remainder attributed to genome editing and cell therapies. This distribution highlights the multifaceted nature of CGT companies, and the relatively low volume of approvals precludes any broad conclusions about prevailing trends in future technologies.\nSource: Evaluate; RSM US LLP", "The forecast for approvals over the next decade presents an intriguing landscape, with a balanced representation of various CGTs, with gene-modified cell therapies gaining slightly more traction than other technologies. This optimistic outlook for approvals, which forecasts a fourfold increase in 2024 and a tenfold increase by 2027, reflects not just ambition but a necessary driving force in the CGT sector. Companies in this space often embrace a forward-leaning stance, understanding that a robust vision for approvals is instrumental for attracting investment to fuel research, development, and innovation.", "It is important to compare these optimistic predictions with historical approval rates. Over the past five years, the FDA has granted an average of 60 novel drug approvals annually (including Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, approvals), encompassing a broad spectrum of technologies beyond just CGTs. If this trend persists, one could expect that less than a quarter of the forecasted approvals for CGTs come to fruition in 2024. This disparity between optimistic forecasts and historical approval rates should not be viewed as negative but rather a reminder of the scrutiny, scientific and clinical validation and the market readiness that these products must meet. This high bar, while tempering approval rates, is a testament to the industry\u2019s commitment to delivering transformative therapies to patients.", "As CGT companies continue to evolve and mature, they should not only present innovation but also adaptability and responsiveness to regulatory standards, clinical efficacy, and patient-centric approaches. This growing pipeline is poised to redefine therapeutic landscapes, making 2024 a pivotal year for the CGT sector.\nSource: Evaluate; RSM US LLP\nOrphan Designation Will Play An Interesting Role In The Cell And Gene Landscape", "The role of Orphan Drug designation is becoming increasingly prominent and strategic in the CGT sector. The Orphan Drug designation is granted to drugs and biologics that treat, diagnose, or prevent rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. This status is not just a regulatory label but a catalyst for innovation and targeted patient care. The incentives it offers, such as tax credits for clinical trial costs, exemption from FDA application fees, and seven years of market exclusivity upon approval, represent significant motivators for CGT companies.", "There are significant synergies and opportunities between the Orphan Drug designation and CGTs, including economic incentives and rare disease targeting. With funding becoming increasingly competitive and labor shortages driving the cost of research and development up, the incentives offered by orphan drug status may become a cornerstone for the viability and success of numerous CGTs. For this reason and as we navigate through 2024, the significance of orphan designation is expected to amplify.", "The interplay between Orphan Drug designation and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) also creates layers of complexity. The IRA is set to have far-reaching implications across all of healthcare, including the CGT sector. One of the IRA\u2019s focal points is the reduction of prescription drug prices, which could intersect with the orphan drug market, especially considering the typically high costs associated with rare disease treatments. While the IRA currently exempts orphan drugs approved for a single indication, CGT companies that choose to pursue additional indications may have their marketing and pricing strategies influenced.", "Companies entering the orphan drug space must navigate the traditional regulatory landscape as well as these emerging policies. While orphan designation offers a pathway to market profitability and exclusivity, the broader market dynamics are influenced by policies, such as the IRA, and necessitate an adaptable approach. This adaptable approach must consider not only clinical success but also long-term sustainability, ethical pricing, market access, and post-market surveillance in an increasingly scrutinized and patient-centric environment.", "According to the FDA, Orphan Drug designations continue to show significant activity, having increased 250% annually across all technologies over the past decade. According to Evaluate, over 80% of CGTs approved in the past decade have Orphan Drug designations. We expect this trend to continue through future approvals; however, this could change as manufacturing processes evolve and technologies with proven success begin targeting non-rare disease indications with larger patient populations.\nSource: RSM US LLP; FDA.gov\nPromising Technology Could Ease Funding Challenges For Cell And Gene Companies", "Funding is crucial for CGT companies, especially since most are in the research stage and need significant investment to bring their innovative therapies to market. Currently, these companies face headwinds due to high interest rates, which have made investments more expensive and led to lower company valuations, causing losses for investors who came in during the high-valuation pandemic era. This has made private equity and venture capital investors, the traditional backers of such companies, cautious. They\u2019re worried about not getting the right valuations, finding profitable exit strategies, and attracting additional investors to support new financing rounds.\nSource: Pitchbook; RSM US LLP", "Despite these challenges, funding has shown resilience, staying relatively steady through 2023; however, PE and VC investors are being more selective, focusing on companies with longer cash runways, proven success in early-stage trials, and alternative income sources, such as licensing and collaboration deals.\nFor CGT companies, having diverse income streams, particularly through licensing and collaboration, can be a significant advantage. Per Evaluate, in 2023, CGTs accounted for 19% of licensing and collaboration agreements, even though they were only 10% of novel approvals and PE and VC investment. This shows that while these companies are still in the early stages of development, their innovative technologies and potential for breakthrough treatments make them attractive partners for larger, more established companies.\nSource: RSM US LLP; Pitchbook", "Both 2022 and 2023 were down years for private investment into biopharma as investors looked to curb risk exposure. We are encouraged that CGT companies (which are pursuing some of the highest risk assets), kept pace with their biopharma peers in terms of long-term investment growth.\nLooking ahead to the latter half of 2024, there\u2019s cautious optimism for a rebound in funding. Signals like a predicted decrease in federal funds rates and cooling inflation might lead to a more favorable investment climate. Historically, when interest rates peak, it\u2019s often followed by a recovery in company valuations. If this pattern holds, 2024 could be the year we see a resurgence in investment activity, with CGT companies well positioned to benefit if they meet the stricter investment criteria set by PE and VC firms.", "An early sign of this rebound could be the performance of publicly traded life sciences companies, including those in the cell and gene sector. According to Bloomberg, as of late January 2024, these companies are keeping pace with the broader biotech market but are trailing behind pharmaceutical companies and the general market, represented by the S&P 500. This indicates there\u2019s plenty of room for growth.\nSource: RSM US LLP; Bloomberg\nThe initial public offering market is another area to watch. Although the life sciences IPO market has been quieter compared to previous years, and CGT companies make up a smaller slice of it, the overall trend of recovery in funding should also be reflected in the IPO activities. Companies thinking of going public should be prepared for a 12- to 24-month journey involving meticulous planning and consultations with investment bankers, lawyers, and accountants.\nSource: RSM US LLP; Pitchbook\nCollaboration And Licensing Agreements Could Be Keys To Success", "In the challenging economic landscape of 2024, collaboration and licensing agreements are signs of life for CGT companies. While rising interest rates have tightened funding across the industry, these strategic partnerships have remained resilient, offering a viable path forward amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nAccording to Evaluate, in 2022, we saw an increase in the value of licensing deals involving CGT companies, with a year-over-year increase of 29% to $62 billion. Despite our data set\u2019s lag in reporting, which is common in the industry, early indications suggest that 2023 should continue this upward trend. More than just numbers, this is a clear sign of the industry\u2019s confidence in the potential of CGTs. These agreements represent investment, not only in the form of dollars but also in the form of resources and expertise, paving the way for accelerated development and expanded market reach.", "According to Evaluate, CGT licensing agreements made up 19% of all deals reported in 2023, even though they accounted for only 10% of novel approvals.

Gene therapy and cell therapy made up the second and third largest technologies with 29% and 27%, respectively.\nSource: RSM US LLP; Evaluate", "Looking ahead, CGT companies should view collaboration and licensing agreements not merely as financial lifelines but as strategic partnerships that offer mutual benefits. While these agreements can provide much-needed capital, they also can bring valuable expertise, access to new technologies, and pathways to new markets. In a time when traditional funding sources are scarce, these agreements represent a strategic pivot to drive the sector forward even in the face of economic headwinds.\nRemain Agile And Flexible In A Year With Contrasting Uncertainty And Opportunity\nIn 2024, CGT companies will be shaped by both economic challenges and scientific promise.\nThese companies will need to be agile and flexible as they navigate economic pressures, leverage regulatory incentives, and embrace collaborative frameworks. By doing so, the industry can continue to experience breakthroughs, ensuring that the revolutionary treatments at its core are fully realized for patients worldwide.", "Note to the reader: An inherent challenge with analyzing data for the cell and gene sector is the classification of what technologies should be included and what companies are pure cell and gene versus biotech or pharma with a diverse pipeline.

Although all private investment in life sciences has grown substantially over the past 10 years, notably, the investment in cell and gene therapy companies has seen remarkable rapid growth.\nSource: CipherBio\nOverall private equity and venture capital investment has grown, with a compound average growth rate of 18% from 2010 through 2021 for life sciences. For gene therapy, the average growth rate over that same period has been 59%. For cell therapy, it has grown 63%. This reflects growth from $362 million in investment in 2020 to nearly $68 billion in 2021 (roughly a third of all private investment made in life sciences).", "This spike in private capital has also supported emerging cell and gene companies as they enter the public markets. Using two of the largest cell and gene-focused indices as benchmarks against their biotech and pharma peers, we see that early growth was on par with biotech as it emerged half a decade earlier, but then went through a period of hyper distortion during the pandemic. As public markets adjust and the economy recovers through 2022, we anticipate cell and gene companies to return to a more metered growth trajectory that is supported by an increasing number of clinical catalysts and hopefully more regulatory approvals.\nThe takeaway for cell and gene companies and their investors is that it is important to separate hype from science. This is an emerging space with a massive potential opportunity, but until commercially proven, it still bears a significant amount of risk.\nSource: Bloomberg\nSource: Evaluate Pharma", "One way to contextualize the substantial growth in investment in cell and gene technologies is to look at forecasted revenue growth for the therapies that are in development. Based on worldwide sales forecasts from Evaluate Pharma, including both approved drugs and ones forecast to be approved, it is expected that conventional drug sales will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% from 2021 to 2026 and biologic sales excluding cell and gene therapies are forecast to grow from $415 billion to $541 billion, a CAGR of 5%. The cell and gene space is poised for substantial growth, with sales projected to increase from $4 billion annually to over $45 billion, over that same period, a significantly higher CAGR of 63%.", "While the total dollar investment in gene therapy as well as cell therapy is only a fraction of what is put into conventional drugs and biologics, it is important to recognize the spillover effects of this growing capital. Investor interest drives innovation, encourages startups, and attracts experienced talent from competing sectors. This in turn drives results in the lab and investment portfolios. We saw this happen in the early days of biotechnology, and today traditional pharmaceutical companies continue to lose ground to their biotech peers in terms of investment, talent, and pipeline. We anticipate a similar story will play out as cell and gene therapy emerges as their own defined sector in the life sciences ecosystem.\nThat is not to say that cell and gene companies will not face challenges.\nDespite Major Investments, Challenges Remain", "Given the large volume of investment into this space, it would be tempting to assume that most major challenges related to the commercialization of cell and gene therapies have been overcome or at least mitigated in the minds of investors. However, that remains far from being true. Although individual companies may have resolved their clinical, manufacturing, and financing challenges, there remains a great deal of work to be done before sector-wide solutions can be universally applied to the cell and gene therapy market. Considerations include:\n- Manufacturing", "The growth and investment in cell and gene therapy are evident in Pfizer's current investment of $800 million to develop manufacturing facilities dedicated to gene therapy production from preclinical research through commercial-scale production. These three plants based in North Carolina highlight the substantial investments that will be required to scale up cell and gene therapies for broad market distribution. Additionally, a report from Bioplan and as reported before in this publication, both CMOs and biomanufacturers are planning to increase their production capacities for cell and gene therapies substantially over the next five years.", "That said, the biggest manufacturing challenge is not a lack of lab space or production capacity. As new therapies are approved, a significant determinant of success will depend on whether the treatments are allogenic (based on cells from a donor) or autologous (based on cells from the patient). Treatments based on allogenic cells fit into a more traditional model of having treatment available for distribution as needed, whereas autologous treatments require modifying cells from the patients themselves to return as a treatment. This means that each dose must be made to order, introducing significant complexity and cost in treatment planning, manufacturing, and the overall supply chain.\n- Pressure to closely follow the early clinical success", "A 2020 analysis published in FoCUS highlights that there is a high correlation between CAR-T and T-cell receptor (TCR) clinical trials based on the volume targeting similar diseases and biological mechanisms. This increases the risk to individual companies that a failure in a trial for a similar candidate could have a significant impact on the expectations of their product. It also highlights a commercial risk in which a company could launch a successful therapy only to see rapid competition from similar CAR-T/TCR therapies that are also under development for the same disease.", "Another risk for investors is that a company places too much emphasis on the success of one therapy for one indication, and then raises capital and sets forecasts for a number of additional trials using the same therapy for different indications. In the context of the cell and gene therapy market, of the 1,022 ongoing cell and gene clinical trials, only 63% include a unique therapy. While not an uncommon practice in the industry, current market hype does present an optimism bias, which can attract capital but may place unrealistic expectations on performance.\n- Reimbursement", "One of the largest outstanding challenges facing cell and gene therapies is that of reimbursement. Currently, the number of therapies and the volume of patients being treated is small enough that payers are willing to accept complicated and experimental approaches to reimbursements, including annuity and installment-based payments and outcomes-based reimbursement. However, it is unclear how scalable these approaches will be if the number of patients benefiting from cell or gene therapies continues to rise. Additionally, payers see frequent turnover in their beneficiaries, making longer-term contracts for treatment after it has been provided difficult to maintain.\nLooking Ahead", "Given the highlighted challenges, the obvious question is why so many investment dollars continue to flow into this space. The expected approvals and financial returns are part of the answer. Companies with strong cell or gene therapy pipelines have proven to be attractive acquisition targets. There is also the promise of rapid cell and gene therapy growth rate in sales compared to other biologics and conventional drugs.\nWhile broad financial returns and a commercially viable market of treatments are still years away, if the promises of cell and gene therapies are proven true, it will be critical that investors and acquiring companies have locked-in access to the most promising researchers, intellectual property, and technology platforms. Gaining this access may turn out to be the most important return on cell and gene therapy investments", "While forecasted sales growth for conventional drugs and other biologics is much higher, the robust growth forecasts for cell and gene therapies continue to draw significant attention from investors. And with ongoing strong investment, we expect that cell and gene therapies will continue to advance through trials, gain approval, and provide substantial long-term returns in patient health and investor portfolios.\nAbout The Authors:\nStephen Kemler is a director and life sciences senior analyst at RSM US LLP.

An increasingly common way to evaluate novel treatments is by applying the quality adjusted years (QALY) analysis, and in a comparative case between Zolgensma\u00ae and Spinraza\u00ae this yielded QALYs of 15.65 and 5.29, respectively (Malone et al., 2019).", ". Similarly, an AAVrh10 vector encoding artificial miRNA has been developed and delivered in a single intra-CSF injection in monkeys to silence the activity of the mutated SOD1, which significantly lowered SOD1 expression in spinal cord motor neurons, and the treatment was overall well-tolerated (Borel et al., 2016, 2018). Likewise, an AAVrh10-antisense-SOD1 vector was tested in vivo in adult SOD1 mutant mice through combined IV and ICV delivery (Biferi et al., 2017). The principle of targeting SOD1 expression with AAV-mediated down-regulation of malign SOD1 variants gained further support from a recently completed compassionate-use study in two SOD1-ALS male patients aged 22 and 56 years old (Mueller et al., 2020).

Different subtypes have been described: Niemann-Pick disease type A presents with cognitive decline, loss of motor function, and hepatosplenomegaly. Rapid neurodegeneration leads to death within 3 years after birth (Samaranch et al., 2019). Niemann-Pick disease type B displays milder progression and symptoms show before adulthood and neurological symptoms are less common. Niemann-Pick disease type C affects trafficking of endocytosed cholesterol, and symptoms start before adulthood and include ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, and loss of language.

Clinical trials are underway (Samaranch et al., 2019). As these do not reach the CNS, gene replacement by injection into the lateral ventricles has been suggested. Studies performed in knockout mice lacking the ASM gene showed some phenotypic improvements, which was not reproduced in non-human primates where poor diffusion from the ventricles into the brain parenchyma limited the spread of the transgene. Injections into the brain parenchyma of AAV vectors encoding the ASM gene were more effective, though only at injection sites limited by poor spread of the transgene (Samaranch et al., 2019)", "Recently, translation into the clinic has begun with three trials currently recruiting. The first is a phase 1/2, open-label, randomized, dose-escalation study sponsored by Homology Medicines to evaluate the safety and efficacy for 1 year after a single IV-injection of an AAVHSC15 vector containing a functional copy of the human PAH gene (HMI-102; NCT03952156). This AAV serotype administered IV has been observed to cross the BBB and transduce neurons in the brain and spinal cord in non-human primates (Ellsworth et al., 2019) and could, consequently, further boost PAH CNS expression in addition to peripheral expression. A second clinical trial is a 5-year follow-up safety and efficacy study to the first trial (NCT04348708). The third trial, sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical, is a phase 1/2 open-label, dose-escalation study which tests an AAV5 carrying a functional PAH gene (BMN 307; NCT04480567).\nGangliosidoses", "Generally, there are two types of vectors coming from either viral or non-viral origin, and the viral vector platforms are predominantly based on Ad, AAV, or retro-/lentiviruses due to observed efficacy, safety profile, and regulatory acceptance. The objective of gene transfer is often to compensate for a pathogenic loss-of-function (LoF) mutation by delivery of a functional gene copy or to downregulate the expression of a pathogenic gain-of-toxic-function (GoTF) mutation by delivery of DNA encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), or antisense RNA (Mitchell et al., 2010; Wang and Gao, 2014).

Boys typically die shortly after birth. In its classic form of RTT, girls have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal development before developing often highly debilitating problems with learning, language, coordination, autism symptomatology, and epilepsy. Several variant forms of RTT have been described which can be milder or more severe than the classic form. Up to 95% of cases of RTT are caused by LoF mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), which is a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulator critical for normal brain function, including the maintenance of synaptic connections (Ip et al., 2018). It remains unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of RTT", "MLD has an incidence of 1.4\u20131.8 in 100,000 live births (Rosenberg et al., 2016). Leukodystrophies are genetic disorders of the CNS leading to progressive neurologic deterioration; in the case of MLD, the disease arises from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) due to LoF mutations in the ARSA gene. This leads to a build-up of sulfatides, resulting in cerebral demyelination and loss of neurons. It affects both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, thus affecting neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous system. MLD is classified depending on age at onset of symptoms, the most common form, known as late infantile form, debuts at around 2 years of age (accounting for 50% of cases). Patients die within a few years after onset and display seizures, impaired swallowing, muscle wasting, paralysis, and dementia. Sulfatides accumulate in several other organs although the effect of this accumulation has not yet been observed", "., with the Audentes Therapeutics gene therapy for treatment of X-linked myotubular myopathy being cleared to resume by the FDA after it was temporarily stopped for carefully reviewing the cases of unexpected deaths7 (Nature Biotechnology, 2020), suggesting that studies involving high systemic doses of AAV vectors should be carefully monitored for similar toxicities (Hinderer et al., 2018). However, even intracerebral AAV administration may also cause potential risks as seen in Lysogene's phase 2/3 trial for MPS IIIA (AAVance) where an unexpected death has presently put this trial on hold, as described above. Since not all adverse events are discovered shortly after the treatment, and some could occur only many years later, long-term follow up studies are required to gain the full understanding of the gene therapy safety profiles", "CLN10 disease is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the CTSD gene encoding cathepsin D, an aspartic endoprotease ubiquitously distributed in lysosomes (Liu et al., 2020). Intracerebral administration of a mosaic AAV1/2 encoding CTSD into neonatal CTSD knockout mice increased lifespan and rescued brain pathology, and CLN10-associated visceral abnormalities as well as lifespan were further improved by peripheral vector treatment (Shevtsova et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2020).\nCLN11 Disease", "Rafi, M.

During the 24 months follow-up period, the AVXS-101 treated patients spent less time hospitalized with lower number of admissions and length of stay as compared to historical controls (Al-Zaidy et al., 2019a).

The disease is progressive and worldwide affects about 5.4 in 100,000 (Chi\u00f2 et al., 2013). ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, causing individuals to gradually lose their strength and ability to speak, eat, move, and even breathe. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3\u20135 years after symptoms first appear. About 5\u201310% of all ALS cases are familial due to mutations in more than a dozen genes. About 34% of all familial cases in Europeans are caused by defects in the C9orf72 gene (most likely GoTF mutations; Mejzini et al., 2019). Another 15\u201330% of familial cases result from GoTF mutations in the gene encoding copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; Mejzini et al., 2019)", ". In addition to potential viral vector-specific risks described above, Cas9-based in vivo genome editing also raises concerns as to potential immunogenic responses to a bacterial protein (Wang et al., 2015, 2020). Nonetheless, considering that rapid progress is being made with development and testing of new genome editing platforms (Poletto et al., 2020), it is likely that genome editing in the future will become relevant as a treatment strategy for several genetic CNS disorders (Lubroth et al., 2021). This would, however, require better understanding and solutions toward safety concerns related to treatment-induced immunogenicity (Shim et al., 2017) and expanded control of on- and off-target modifications (Mills et al., 2003).", "Fu, C., Armstrong, D., Marsh, E., Lieberman, D., Motil, K., Witt, R., et al.

Consequently, gene therapeutic pre-clinical studies are so far limited. Since more than 100 causative genes have been identified in epilepsy syndromes (Helbig and Ellis, 2020), it can, however, be expected that gene therapy will attract increasing attention for treating genetic epilepsies in the near future. One example of a gene therapeutic approach was conducted with a RNAi vector (scAAV9-miDnm1a), targeting pathogenic DNM1 gene variants in a mouse model of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that prevented development of lethal tonic-clonic seizures (Aimiuwu et al., 2020)", "Traditional medications are available as symptomatic treatment for symptoms such as seizures, anxiety, depression, parkinsonism, and spasticity.

For instance, in SMA, animal models strongly suggest a critical window for gene therapy to achieve effective rescue, and clinical trials on children with SMA1 show improved outcome when gene therapy is performed earlier in the disease course (Robbins et al., 2014; Govoni et al., 2018). The same was found in post-hoc analysis where the biggest motor improvements were obtained in infants with SMA1 treated at an early age, highlighting the value of newborn screening and early treatment (Lowes et al., 2019).

The definition, including the patient numbers, is important to drug developers aspiring to enter the fast-track and orphan drug programs for development of treatments for patients with rare diseases which can include additional regulatory support and advising, as well as economic incentives, and market exclusivity. Here, we focus on the current development and prospects of gene therapies for treatment of a subgroup of rare diseases, namely, rare diseases affecting the brain and spinal cord with known genetic etiology.", "Most types of gene therapy up till now use the in vivo approach of administering vectors that transfer DNA sequences into cells of the nervous system. Nonetheless, ex vivo modified re-implanted genetically modified stem cells have shown promising results as evidenced by the EMA approval of Libmeldy\u00ae for MLD and completed or ongoing clinical trials in ALD and MLD. So far, genome editing holds an unredeemed potential in treating rare genetic diseases of the brain and spinal cord providing improved symptomatic alleviation or in some cases even a curative potential. Most progress has been seen with MPS I and MPS II, where ex vivo and in vivo genome editing strategies are promising and have even reached clinical testing (Table 2). Here, we have until now seen the ZFNs being utilized rather than CRISPR/Cas9 even though the latter can be more easily designed and implemented, which could be due to the concerns associated with the off-target effects seen with CRISPR/Cas9 (Merkle et al., 2015)", "This condition can result from more than 35 different mutations in the MFSD8 gene encoding CLN7, a lysosomal putative membrane transporter protein (Danyukova et al., 2018). Recently, a novel concept known as N-of-1 treatment has emerged, which encompasses true personalized medicine and development of specific treatment for single patients (Mullard, 2020). This was showcased by the development within only 1 year of a new unique ASO treatment, milasen, for a young child, suffering from CLN7 due to a unique mutation that caused mis-splicing of MFSD8 (Kim et al., 2019). After dose escalation followed by maintenance dosing every 3 months, it was found that seizures were substantially decreased and several neurologic and neuropsychological subscores stabilized during 7 months after treatment (Kim et al., 2019)", "SMA is characterized by degeneration of spinal cord alpha motor neurons resulting in muscular wasting. The disease impairs the patient's ability to walk, speak and breathe (Pattali et al., 2019). It affects approximately 10 in 100,000 newborns and is the most common monogenic disease leading to death in infants (Darras, 2015; Chen, 2020). SMA is the result of a LoF mutation in the survival of motor-neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN1 encodes a protein essential for survival of the alpha motor neurons. The function of the protein is not yet completely understood (Kariyawasam et al., 2018). The human genome has a similar gene, survival of motor-neuron 2 (SMN2), which exists in multiple copies in the genome and is different from SMN1 only by a few nucleotides, notably a nucleotide variant in exon 7. This variant in SMN2 leads to exclusion of exon 7, resulting in an unstable protein", "Different AAV vector-mediated and ASO strategies aiming at silencing SOD1 or C9orf72 as a therapeutic approach in familial ALS are currently being developed and tested in pre-clinical studies (Cappella et al., 2019; Amado and Davidson, 2021). Novartis Gene Therapies (formerly AveXis) has developed a self-complementary AAV9 vector expressing a short hairpin (sh) RNA to silence SOD1, and this vector has shown promising results after IV or intra-cisterna magna delivery in SOD1 mutant mice at different ages (Foust et al., 2013; Iannitti et al., 2018).

The first clinical application of lentiviral-based gene therapy was for treatment of inherited metabolic disorders including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Eichler et al., 2017), metachromatic leukodystrophy (Rosenberg et al., 2016), and mucopolysaccharidoses (Kinsella et al., 2020), with the aim of increasing enzyme bioavailability and brain entry (Begley et al., 2008) for correction of the neuropathological phenotype (see below in the disease sections for more details)", "This type of MPS is divided into three subtypes (Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes) based on severity of symptoms. All three are caused by a defective gene causing alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme deficiency and tissue accumulation of the GAGs heparan and dermatan sulfate (Hampe et al., 2021). Several encouraging studies have been performed using animal models of MPS type 1 with intrathecally or IV administered IDUA gene replacement approach using serotype 9 or rh10 AAV vectors, including in rodents, dogs, cats, and non-human primates (Watson et al., 2006; Hinderer et al., 2014, 2015; Belur et al., 2020).

Two phase 3, randomized, double-blind trials (CHERISH, NCT02292537; ENDEAR, NCT02193074) have confirmed the efficacy of nusinersen with a 47% reduction in risk of death or permanent ventilation and a favorable safety profile (Finkel et al., 2017; Kariyawasam et al., 2018; Mercuri et al., 2018).

Realizing that the early modular assembly ZFNs were too error proned (Ramirez et al., 2008), the development has moved toward selection-guided assembly ZFNs (Greisman and Pabo, 1997; Cornu et al., 2008), and creation of synthetic ZFN oligomers displaying higher affinity and specificity toward larger multiple triplet basepair sequences (Urnov et al., 2010). This increase in combinatorial opportunities means that it is now possible to select ZFNs targeting almost any thinkable DNA sequence.

This is expected to provide permanent, liver-specific expression of IDUA. A 10-year long-term safety follow-up study is also ongoing (NCT04628871). Although CNS symptoms were clearly improved in a mouse model of MPS I (Ou et al., 2020), it is disputed to what extent enzymes will pass into the CNS (Poletto et al., 2020). Nonetheless, it is suggested that constant high blood levels of IDUA in the blood may cause sufficient amounts to reach the brain (Ou et al., 2020).", "Shyng, C., Nelvagal, H. R., Dearborn, J.

Considering that the vast majority of medical treatments available for diseases of this review offer merely symptomatic alleviation without targeting the underlying pathological etiology, approval of more gene therapies by regulatory authorities could become game changers for patients affected by rare diseases. This also highlights the potential of a paradigm shift where we move from symptomatic alleviation to disease modification and even cure.\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted version.\nConflict of Interest\nDW is co-founder and consultant of CombiGene AB (Lund, Sweden) and CG is employed by UCB Nordic A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark).", ". In 2021, results were published from the STR1VE study (NCT03306277) in 22 patients younger than 6 months with SMA with biallelic SMN1 mutations (deletion or point mutations) and one or two copies of SMN2, and compared to untreated patients from pediatric neuromuscular clinical research dataset (Day et al., 2021). At the 18 month of age study visit, in patients treated with AVXS-101, 59% achieved functional independent sitting (0% in the control group) and 91% survived free from permanent ventilation at age 14 months (vs. 26% in the control group). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were bronchiolitis, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, and three serious adverse events were related or possibly related to the treatment (two patients had elevated hepatic aminotransferases, and one had hydrocephalus). Long-term benefits and risks await to be determined", "This is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from GoTF mutations in the form of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3 that encodes the widely expressed cytoplasmic protein, huntingtin (HTT, Jimenez-Sanchez et al., 2017). This leads to abnormal expansion of the polyglutamine sequence in HTT resulting in HTT aggregation that causes neurodegeneration, choreatic movements, as well as cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The prevalence of HD varies globally but overall affects around 2.7 in 100,000, and it commonly affects patients between the ages of 30\u201350 years, being most often fatal 10\u201315 years after diagnosis (Pringsheim et al., 2012). There is no cure for the disease, and current treatment is merely aimed at improving the quality of life and decreasing complications", ". Several conditions with signs and symptoms overlapping those of RTT have been found to result from mutations in other genes. These conditions, including forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1) syndrome and cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder, were previously thought to be variant forms of RTT but are now usually considered to be separate disorders.", "Another largely monogenic rare genetic epilepsy syndrome is that of Angelman syndrome which is most often caused by LoF mutations in the maternal UBE3A gene encoding ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (Turner et al., 2021). This UBE3A deficiency can be potentially treated by gene replacement therapy and, indeed, intrahippocampal AAV9-UBE3A injection caused some improvements in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (Daily et al., 2011). However, there is some concern that a gene replacement strategy could be associated with side effects if UBE3A expression levels become too high since this might result in autism (Vatsa and Jana, 2018). An alternative strategy that has been explored is to activate the dormant UBE3A gene on the paternally inherited chromosome which is silenced by expression of paternal expression of UBE3A-ATS transcripts by the use of ASO treatment targeting UBE3A-ATS (Elgersma and Sonzogni, 2021)", "Lloyd-Evans, E., Morgen, A.

Three subclasses exist based on onset of symptoms and severity of progression: Congenital, infantile and juvenile. CD is fatal in its congenital form where children die within days or weeks after birth (Ahmed and Gao, 2013, Gessler and Gao, 2016). Most patients suffer from the infantile form with symptoms including hypotonia, macrocephaly, blindness, and halting motor function development starting within the first postnatal months (Gessler and Gao, 2016).", "A Short Overview of Gene Therapy Development", "KD is an autosomal recessive, often fatal lysosomal storage disease leading to pronounced neurodegeneration (Kwon et al., 2018). KD is also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy because of the characteristic multinucleated globoid cells found in a brain biopsy and the presence of white matter degeneration. The disease has an estimated prevalence around 1 in 100,000 (Foss et al., 2013). KD is caused by a LoF mutation at human chromosome 14, which codes for a lysosomal hydrolase known as galactosylceramide beta hydrolase (GALC), which is responsible for metabolizing galactolipids in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. KD disease is subdivided into sub-categories based on the age at presentation of symptoms. It is possible to screen newborns for KD, but current tests to identify which children are likely to develop the disease are inadequate (Kwon et al., 2018; Ehmann and Lantos, 2019)", ". A pre-clinical study with intracerebral delivery of AAV2-ASM in non-human primates resulted in only low spread of expression and toxicity in the form of immunogenicity as well as abnormal gait and posture and paresis in animals treated with high doses (Salegio et al., 2012). The immunogenicity and inflammatory response was suggested to arise from ASM-induced upregulation of cytokine CCL5 that is associated with gliosis and inflammation (Salegio et al., 2012). It is not clear to what extent CCL5 upregulation can limit the usefulness of ASM gene replacement therapy. Delivery has been also attempted via CSF through the cerebellomedullary cistern, resulting in transgene expression and better spread to deeper brain structures (Samaranch et al., 2019). Despite the initially promising opportunity of gene replacement, pre-clinical studies have revealed challenges related to ASM-induced calcium imbalance, aberrant intracellular signaling, inflammation and cell death (Lloyd-Evans et al", "., 2017), and in MLD ex vivo gene therapy appears to predominantly work on pre-symptomatic or early-symptomatic patients (Penati et al., 2017).", ". In addition, lentivirus vectors have been modified to minimize the risk of host genome integration or to direct the insertional mutagenesis into heterochromatin regions (not affecting gene activation or silencing), for safe and stable transduction of non-dividing cells or transient transduction in actively dividing cells (Lentz et al., 2012). The development of more efficient and safer vectors over the years has resulted in LVs, which are self-inactivating and replication-incompetent (Zufferey et al., 1998). Using pseudotyping with glycoproteins have enabled specific tropisms and tissue-specificity, and have facilitated specific transduction to the retina and HSPCs (Duisit et al., 2002; MacKenzie et al., 2002). LVs have been tested in many successful clinical trials, and have become a preferred tool in particular in ex vivo gene therapy strategies for treating genetic diseases (see below).", "Citation: Jensen TL, G\u00f8tzsche CR and Woldbye DPD (2021) Current and Future Prospects for Gene Therapy for Rare Genetic Diseases Affecting the Brain and Spinal Cord.

The discipline of gene therapy includes: (1) in vivo vector-mediated gene therapy, (2) ex vivo cell transduction gene therapy, and (3) genome editing (Brenner et al., 2020).

In monogenetic CNS diseases, a disease-causing mutation leading to either LoF or GoTF can be corrected by targeted editing of the specific mutation to restore a healthy phenotype. The available editing tools include zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), or the CRISPR/Cas systems (Goswami et al., 2019; Poletto et al., 2020).", "., Batten disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, gangliosidoses) or, less frequently, gain-of-toxic-function mutation diseases by gene therapeutic silencing of pathologic genes (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease). In addition, the use of genome editing as a gene therapy is being explored for some diseases, but this has so far only reached clinical testing in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidoses. Based on the large number of planned, ongoing, and completed clinical trials for rare genetic central nervous system diseases, it can be expected that several novel gene therapies will be approved and become available within the near future. Essential for this to happen is the in depth characterization of short- and long-term effects, safety aspects, and pharmacodynamics of the applied gene therapy platforms.", "Pre-clinical safety and efficacy of ex vivo transduction of CD34-positive HSPCs with a LV containing SGSH (LV-SGSH) has been demonstrated (Ellison et al., 2019).

These capsids have been discovered by (1) vectorization from natural isolates, (2) from rational designs using pre-existing capsids (Chen et al., 2009), (3) directed evolution using interative selection of mutated capsids, e.g., AAV2.7m8 (Dalkara et al., 2013), AAVPHP.B (Deverman et al., 2016), and AAV-F (Hanlon et al., 2019), (4) and by in silico approaches using computation tools to design novel synthetic capsids (Wang et al., 2019). So far, the approved AAV gene therapies, such as Glybera\u00ae and Luxturna\u00ae, are derived from naturally occurring variants (AAV capsid serotype 1 and 2, respectively). Currently, AAV vectors are regarded the least immunogenic and with less vector-associated toxicity, which make them preferred for many CNS diseases.

In the 1980s, the concept formed of using a virus vector for gene transfer into mammalian cells (Williams et al., 1984), and, in 1990, the first approved gene therapy trial took place with viral vector-mediated transfer of the gene encoding the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) in a 4-year-old patient suffering from chromosome X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) due to ADA deficiency (Blaese et al., 1995). Hereafter followed a decade of new trials and great optimism, which culminated in two trials with unfortunate outcomes, and a transient halt of further gene therapy trials", ". The host cell responds to this break by a mechanism known as homology-directed repair where donor DNA is offered as a template for the repair, thereby allowing gene editing and repair based on a healthy DNA template (Karimian et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2019). Recently, the CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing has prevailed over the ZFNs and TALENs since they are easier to engineer to recognize unique sequences. The DNA-binding specificity of ZFNs and TALENs is dependent on protein-DNA interactions whereas the CRISPR/Cas is provided by the sgRNAs, which are simpler and less expensive to design (Duarte and D\u00e9glon, 2020).", "To ensure development of treatments for rare disease, including gene therapies, biopharmaceutical companies are incentivized with the prospect of fast-track designations and longer market exclusivity. Nonetheless, current and future gene therapies are coming with very high prices, many-fold higher than for other treatment modalities, which is justified by the higher development costs and small market of rare diseases. This will most likely limit the number of patients being offered new treatments even though there is evidence of efficacy and safety. This also means that the biopharmaceutical companies will be forced to build strong cases on how they can provide value for money to receive market authorization and recommendations for public or insurance reimbursement differing from country to country. In the case of Zolgensma\u00ae for SMA, the total costs range from 4.2 to 6.6 million dollars (Malone et al", ".5 years follow-up after treatment with OTL-200 suggested a favorable safety profile (no treatment-related mortality, no malignancies, no abnormal clonal expansion, and no evidence of replication-competent lentiviruses) and efficacy at modifying the disease course of early-onset MLD patients (hematological recovery, stable OTL-200 engraftment, ARSA activity restoration, and long-term stabilization of motor functions) as compared to a national history cohort (Calbi et al., 2020). Recently, OTL-200 was approved for treatment of MLD by EMA in 2020 under the tradename Libmeldy\u00ae, but OTL-200 is not yet approved by the FDA. In addition, two studies applying the same principle, but in later onset symptomatic MLD patients, have been initiated to evaluate short- and long-term safety and efficacy (NCT02559830, NCT04283227).", "Recombinant AAV vectors have found particular use in treatment strategies for CNS diseases (Mendell et al., 2021). AAV vectors are versatile and induce expression in both dividing and non-dividing cells and remain predominantly as single- or double-stranded DNA within the cell nucleus in episomal form (Salganik et al., 2015), although, in vivo and in vitro characterizations have suggested an integrative potential for wild-type AAV into a specific site in chromosome 19 in the human (Kotin et al., 1990, 1991). AAVs and their simple DNA genomes are well-studied, and AAV-based vectors have been shown to deliver long-term transgene expression, which has been documented up to 10 years in humans and up to 15 years in non-human primates after administration (Sehara et al., 2017; Chu et al., 2020). Several different AAV serotypes have been discovered, which differ by their specific tropism and tissue specificity linked to the diverse surface capsid proteins they express", "., 2012). No severe adverse events related to the administration of AAV2-ASPA into six intracerebral infusion sites were reported after a minimum of 5-years follow-up (Leone et al., 2012).", "GM2 gangliosidoses include the Tay-Sachs disease, the Sandhoff disease, and the GM2 AB, which result from LoF mutations in the genes HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A, respectively (Dastsooz et al., 2018). These variants of GM2 gangliosidoses are clinically indistinguishable, but are all associated with beta-hexosaminidase deficiency (Leal et al., 2020). All three variants are usually fatal by early childhood. Tay-Sachs disease, which is the more common of the GM2 gangliosidoses (0.5 in 100,000; Meikle et al., 1999), debuts around 6 months of age and results in death by the age of 4 years. Sandhoff disease (0.25 in 100,000; Meikle et al., 1999) results from LoF mutations in the HEXB gene on chromosome 5, critical for the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B. The GM2 AB variant is caused by gene mutations causing cofactor GM2 activator deficiency leading to lack of the normal beta-hexosaminidase A", ". It is estimated that the protein production resulting from SMN2 creates 90% truncated proteins (without exon 7) and generates 10% normal but still unstable SMN proteins. These proteins can partially compensate for the loss of SMN1, and it is argued that SMN2 copy number in the genome determines phenotypic severity (Pattali et al., 2019; Chen, 2020). SMA is classified in different clinical phenotypes based on age at onset of symptoms, the level of motor functions achieved, and number of SMN2 genes", ". This is an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study evaluating safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics after intracisternal delivery of RGX-111 to MPS I patients during the 24 weeks study period. An ongoing ex vivo phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT03488394) explores safety and efficacy of IV-injected autologous HSPCs genetically modified to express IDUA using a LV in patients with the Hurler variant. A long-term follow-up study will look for adverse neurologic and other events for up to 30 years after (NCT00695279). Genome editing has also been explored as a treatment approach. Both ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 platform studies where AAV8 vectors were injected IV to genome edit liver cells have shown encouraging results in rodents (Ou et al., 2020; Poletto et al., 2020). The latter platform may be more efficacious (Ou et al", ". In 2019, a non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical trial started aiming at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose AAV9-GLB1 (AXO-AAV-GM-1) after IV infusion to subjects, aged 2\u201312 years old, with Type II GM1 gangliosidosis (NCT03952637). The study is conducted in a collaboration between the National Human Genome Research Institute and Axovant Sciences and is expected to be completed in 2023. Not long after in April 2020, Lysogene started another phase 1/2 clinical trial aiming at evaluating safety and efficacy of different doses of AAVrh10-GLB1 (LYS-GM101) infused IV to subjects with infantile Type I GM1 gangliosidosis (NCT04273269). This study is expected to be completed in 2025. Passage Bio is sponsoring a third phase 1/2, single-arm, dose escalation, multicenter study currently recruiting that will test an AAVhu68-GLB1 vector (PBGM01) delivered into the cisterna magna in infantile GM1 patients with Types I and IIa gangliosidoses (NCT04713475).", ". Thus, a long-term study over up to 10 years in dogs treated with AAV vectors systemically for hemophilia A showed that the AAV vectors inserted its own genome into genes of the dogs associated with cell growth that could potentially lead to malignancy (Nguyen et al., 2021). Still the progress made has shown that the current wave of gene therapies being developed appears safer and more promising than its predecessors (Bulaklak and Gersbach, 2020).", "Bey, K., Deniaud, J., Dubreil, L., Joussemet, B., Cristini, J., and Ciron, C.

ICV-administered scAAV9 encoding CLN6 drastically reduced pathology, improved memory, motor performance, and survival in CLN6 mutant mice (Cain et al., 2019). ICV delivery of scAAV9-CLN6 also slowed visual deterioration in CLN6 disease mice by preventing disease pathology in visual centers of the brain and retina (White et al., 2021). Intrathecal gene therapy with a similar vector was shown to be safe and efficiently induce expression in the brain and spinal cord in non-human primates (Cain et al., 2019). A phase 1/2 single dose study is ongoing to test intrathecal administration of scAA9-CLN6 (AT-GTX-501) in CLN6 disease children (NCT02725580) and a 15-year follow-up study will evaluate long-term safety and efficacy (NCT04273243).\nCLN7 Disease", ". However, despite reduced morbidity, these do not prevent persisting neurocognitive and musculoskeletal deficits (Fraldi et al., 2018). It is, therefore, not surprising that gene therapeutic approaches are under exploration. Here we will mainly describe the gene therapy efforts in the MPS types I, II, and III which show consistent CNS involvement. In other MPS types, e.g., VI, although clinical testing has been performed, CNS is not affected and, consequently, outside the scope of this review (for review see Fraldi et al., 2018).", "This adult onset disease is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene that encodes the protein granulin implicated in lysosomal function (Liu et al., 2020). Heterozygous mutations are associated with frontotemporal dementia (Baker et al., 2006; Cruts et al., 2006). Pre-clinical studies with CLN11 gene therapy using GRN knockout mice have generated conflicting results with AAV1-GRN vector injected into prefrontal cortex showing improved pathology, also outside the injected region (Arrant et al., 2018), while ICV injection of AAV9-GRN using a different promoter was associated with severe hippocampal neurodegeneration (Amado et al., 2019). Further pre-clinical studies are needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of gene therapy with GRN overexpression for CLN11 disease.\nKrabbe Disease (KD)", ". However, gene therapy has been explored at the pre-clinical level since gene replacement normalizing liver PAH activity and even boosting CNS PAH expression are predicted to potentially improve cognition and quality-of-life for PKU patients. Thus, both ex vivo and in vivo PAH gene replacement therapy in murine models of PKU (Gessler and Gao, 2016). For instance, in vivo PAH gene replacement by portal or tail vein injection in mice using an AAV8-PAH vector was associated with long-term reduction of phenylalanine levels with no elevation of markers of liver damage, inflammation, or humoral immune response against vector-mediated PAH expression (Ding et al., 2006; Harding et al., 2006).", ". Therefore, it is likely that gene therapy using viral DNA vectors encoding shRNA/siRNA/miRNA/antisense RNA will prove to be better suited for obtaining a more stable long-lasting effect without the need for repeated central injections as seen with ASOs. Already AAV vectors are being tested in clinical trials to reduce production of pathologic proteins resulting from GoTF mutations for ALS (AAVrh10-antisense-SOD1) and HD (AAV5-miHTT).", ". MSA patients may benefit from l-dopa for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinsonism symptoms, whereas physiotherapy remains the best therapeutic option for the ataxia (Perez-Lloret et al., 2015).", "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases characterized by an enduring pre-disposition to generate seizures. Despite having an overall lifetime prevalence of approximately 800 in 100,000 (Beghi, 2020), it comprises a large heterogeneous group of syndromes of which some of them fulfill the definition of a rare disease in this review (i.e., <40\u201360 in 100,000), e.g., Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; 2.5 in 100,000), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (15 in 100,000), West syndrome (infantile spasms; 8 in 100,000), and Angelman syndrome (5\u20138 in 100,000) (Buiting et al., 2016; D\u00f6ring et al., 2016). The majority of these genetic epilepsies are diagnosed within the first months to years of life with developmental deterioration or seizures as the first symptomatic signs. Since these syndromes are mostly drug-resistant, gene therapy could become an alternative treatment avenue (Turner et al., 2021).", "As the cell and tissue tropism of different AAV serotypes became better understood, it also became apparent that some serotypes are better than others at reaching the CNS after systemic administration, for example, AAV9, AAVrh8, AAVrh10, and AAVHSC15 can cross the BBB after intravenous (IV) administration, resulting in widespread transduction of the CNS and peripheral organs through a less invasive procedure (Yang et al., 2014; Ellsworth et al., 2019; Belur et al., 2020). Intravascular administration is the current delivery method for Zolgensma\u00ae, approved for treatment of SMA1, as discussed later, which utilizes the AAV9 vector capabilities of crossing the BBB (Chen, 2020). In addition, new AAV subtypes, such as AAV-PHP.B, show up to 40 times higher efficiency at transducing neurons and astrocytes when compared to IV-injections of AAV9 (Liu et al., 2021). However, it appears that AAV-PHP", "Discussion", "MSA is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic failure, impacting on striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic systems, with an approximate prevalence around 2 in 100,000 (Chrysostome et al., 2004). The key pathological hallmark is the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions with insoluble proteinaceous filaments in the oligodendrocytes, and therefore MSA is regarded as an \u03b1-synucleinopathy along with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The etiology of MSA is largely unknown, although some emerging evidence suggests the involvement of mutations in the genes SNCA, COQ2, MAPT, GBA1, LRRK2, and C9orf72 (Katzeff et al., 2019).

Mila's case has created new hope in rare and ultra-rare diseases where gene therapy can potentially be developed in cases where only one person in the world has a specific genetic mutation (Kim et al., 2019). As for CLN7 disease patients, most of them will probably not benefit from treatment strategies targeting RNA mis-splicing.

A single neonatal ICV injection of a scAAV-9 vector encoding human CLN8 has recently shown a successful degree of rescue in a mouse CLN8 model, as revealed by reduced histopathology, substantial behavioral improvement, and increased lifespan (Johnson et al., 2021). These data clearly encourage the testing of gene therapy for this disorder.\nCLN10 Disease", "CD is a rare leukodystrophy resulting in neurodegeneration that occurs after a LoF mutation in the gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA). ASPA deacetylates N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and dysfunction results in accumulation of NAA in the nervous system (and in urine). The result of accumulation of NAA is dysmyelination, vacuolation of white matter and intramyelinic edema leading to hydrocephalus (Ahmed and Gao, 2013). The overall incidence is unknown. It occurs most frequently in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent where it affects, at up to 16 in 100,000 (Zayed, 2015). ASPA mRNA is mainly found in oligodendrocytes while it is not present in neurons (Kirmani et al., 2002). NAA is produced in neurons and transported to the extracellular space where it is taken up by glial cells. NAA constitutes more than 0.1% of the healthy brain by weight, yet the function of NAA remains largely unknown, and the mechanism of CD pathology is unclear (Leone et al", "Huntington's Disease (HD)", "CNL2 also known as \u201cLate Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (LINCL),\u201d derives from a defect in the lysosomal gene CLN2 encoding the enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) (Kohlsch\u00fctter and Schulz, 2016), resulting in the lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Clinical trials completed and ongoing suggest promising effects of intraventricular enzyme replacement therapy (BMN190; Markham, 2017; Schulz et al., 2018), but gene therapy is also being explored (Liu et al., 2020). AAV vectors encoding human TPP1 induced cerebral enzyme expression and increased survival in a mouse model of CLN2 disease after intracerebral administration (Passini et al., 2006; Kohlsch\u00fctter and Schulz, 2016), and a human clinical trial (NCT00151216) with infusion into 12 distinct cerebral locations in 10 children suggested slowing of disease progression (Worgall et al., 2008; Souweidane et al., 2010)", "The first pre-clinical gene therapy studies on CD utilized a lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system in combination with an AAV-based plasmid encoding ASPA that was administered by intracerebral and intraventricular injections to healthy rodents and primates (Gessler and Gao, 2016). Subsequently, a proof-of-concept study with the same injection constructs was performed on two children with CD (Leone et al., 2000). Although the effect of this type of gene therapy was well-tolerated, and some biochemical and radiological parameters improved, no clinically relevant disease rescue was observed (Gessler and Gao, 2016). A few years later a follow up study conducted a phase 1 trial in a larger group of CD patients with an improved system for delivering the enzyme (AAV2-ASPA; Janson et al., 2002; Leone et al., 2012). A follow-up study found that AAV2-ASPA gene therapy slowed progression of brain atrophy, reduced seizures, and stabilized overall clinical status (Leone et al", "Currently, promising pre-clinical data (Bradbury et al., 2018, 2021; Rafi et al., 2020) have enabled Forge Biologics to plan recruitment in 2021 of children below 12 months of age in a phase 1/2 clinical study, performing IV administration of an AAVrh10 vector expressing GALC (FBX-101) in newborns with early-infantile KD receiving HSPC transplantation (NCT04693598). A similar approach is applied by Passage Bio who intend to start recruitment in 2021 of 1\u20139 months children with early-infantile KD for treatment with intracisternal injections with the recombinant AAVhu68 vector encoding human GALC (PBKR03; NCT04771416).

Whereas the \u03b3RV was used earlier, the field has moved to prefer the lentivirus, and especially the HIV-1 virus as vector platform. LVs possess desirable characteristics, including genome integration for persistent long-term transgene expression in both postmitotic and quiescent cells (Naldini et al., 1996), low immunogenic potential (Abordo-Adesida et al., 2005), and relatively large transgene cassette capacity enabling expression of multiple genes from a single vector construct (Zhu et al., 2001; Tian and Andreadis, 2009). In contrast to the gamma-retroviral vectors, the LVs do not integrate into the genome within the proximity of oncogene transcriptional start sites, making them much less prone to oncogenic risk, and therefore they are regarded as much safer (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2002; Cattoglio et al., 2007)", "MPS type IIID causes Sanfilippo syndrome D due to deficiency in N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (GNS; Pearse and Iacovino, 2020). GNS-deficient mice show lysosomal storage CNS pathology, locomotor deficits, and shortened lifespan similar to humans with MPS IIID, and intracisternal administration of a vector encoding GNS (AAV9-GNS) reversed these deficits (Roca et al., 2017). These encouraging results await clinical testing.\nNeurometabolic Disorders\nCanavan Disease (CD)", ".

No results are available yet.", ". However, for this to happen it is essential to obtain an even better understanding of the biology, pharmacodynamics, and safety of the applied systems. This became increasingly evident during the 1990s with the occurrence of firstly a fatal case of acute immunogenicity induced by a human adenovirus (type 5) vector in an ornithine transcarbamylase trial (Raper et al., 2003), and secondly genotoxicity induced by treatment with a gamma-retro virus vector in SCID-X1 (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003). These events were not expected but have had far reaching effects not only on the affected patients but also on the trajectory of gene therapy research and clinical trials. This has underlined the requirements and importance of both short-term and long-term monitoring of efficacy and safety aspects (Wilson, 2009; Somanathan et al., 2020). Recently we were once again reminded of the intrinsic uncertainties in drug development, e.g", "Delivery of genetic material is an important issue since accessibility of systemically administered treatments targeting the CNS has long been complicated by the tightly regulated blood-brain barrier (BBB) that controls passage into the CNS (Kimura and Harashima, 2020). Direct intracerebral injection into the parenchyma, although highly invasive, is one way to circumvent this problem, which also ensures a direct match between treatment delivery and the targeted region. This method could be preferred when the target is a defined and limited area of the brain or when targeting deeper brain structures in humans such as the thalamus or putamen (Hocquemiller et al., 2016; Taghain et al., 2020). Intracerebral administration into specific brain regions will typically be associated with the administration of lower numbers of viral genomes compared to those required for systemic administration which limits the risk of toxicity", "Lysosomal Storage Diseases\nBatten Disease\nBatten disease is the common name for a broad class of rare, fatal, inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases affecting the nervous system and often retina, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (CLNs; Johnson et al., 2019). Batten disease affects 2\u20134 in 100,000 live births (Santavuori, 1988) and has several forms (CLN1-CLN14; Specchio et al., 2021) that share some common features and symptoms but vary in severity and age when symptoms appear. Each form is caused by LoF mutations in different genes affecting lysosomal function. Most forms of Batten disease/CLNs begin during childhood where symptoms may include vision loss, seizures, loss of previously acquired skills, dementia, abnormal movements, and greatly shortened life expectancy.", "Iannitti, T., Scarrott, J.

From the modeling and simulations based on parametric curves fitted to estimate the probability of patients dying during each model cycle, it was assumed that 50% of SMA patients treated with Zolgensma\u00ae will survive until the age of 35, while the corresponding simulation applied to the ASO Spinraza\u00ae showed only 50% survival to the age of 3 years (Malone et al., 2019)", ".

In contrast, neurotoxic effects were observed in normal macaques after bilateral intra-thalamic infusion of a combination of two AAVr8 vectors encoding \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits at three tested doses, suggesting that species differences exist with regards to effects of gene therapeutic regulations of HEXA/HEXB (Golebiowski et al., 2017).

The economic challenges that pharmaceutical companies face when considering investment in gene therapies for rare diseases are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the high cost of developing and bringing these therapies to market. According to Michael Moussourakis, Vice President of Strategy at Alconox Inc., pharmaceutical companies often face significant expenses in the research and development phase, as well as in the clinical trials and regulatory approval processes [1]. These costs can be especially high for gene therapies, as they involve cutting-edge technology and specialized expertise.\n\nFurthermore, the economics of drug development and pricing also play a significant role in companies' decisions to invest in rare disease treatments. According to a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research, patents play a crucial role in allowing pharmaceutical companies to charge high prices for medications, as they serve as a financial incentive for innovation [2]. Without this protection, other companies would be able to enter the market and compete, potentially driving down prices and reducing profits for the incumbent company.\n\nHowever, government policies and legislation can also impact the economics of drug development and pricing. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden in 2022 includes significant provisions that will impact drug pricing and patient access to medications [3]. As noted by the ZS Research Center, these changes may have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry, potentially affecting their profits and ability to invest in new treatments.\n\nIn addition to economic considerations, there are also ethical questions surrounding the prioritization of financial gain over patient well-being. As discussed at a conference on lowering prescription drug prices, there is a need to balance the social value of new drugs with the high costs of developing them [4]. This highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that takes into account both the economic and ethical considerations when it comes to investing in gene therapies for rare diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic challenges facing pharmaceutical companies when considering investment in gene therapies for rare diseases are complex and multifaceted. Further research and understanding of the financial models of these companies, as well as potential policy shifts, could help incentivize investment in these important and promising treatments. It is also crucial to consider patient perspectives and prioritize their well-being in these discussions.", "user_utterance": "Can you describe the economic challenges that pharmaceutical companies encounter when considering investment in gene therapies for rare diseases?", "search_queries": ["What are the economic challenges faced by pharmaceutical companies when investing in gene therapy for rare diseases?", "How do pharmaceutical companies determine the profitability of investing in rare disease treatments?", "What policies could potentially incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in rare disease treatments?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.pharmasalmanac.com/articles/what-are-the-current-investment-trends-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry", "description": "The projected global gene therapy market, estimated to reach $44.7 billion by 2032, underscores significant opportunities, especially in regions with high disease prevalence.

This decreases output and results in some of the consumer surplus from Indication B patients now being captured by the firm.", "The rapid increase in clinical trial activity for precision products and the number of products receiving orphan designations should change the nature of pricing and competition in these markets. Precision medicines and orphan products have, on average, higher prices than other medications. As we discuss in our joint work, and as Stern, Chandra, and Brian Alexander explain in an additional paper, these high prices are the result of a selection effect of products brought to market rather than a special pricing rule for orphan diseases.5 For example, given the small patient population, firms will only bring to market products that generate large amounts of value for individuals with those conditions. For such products, the potential value created leads to an expected price and resulting profits that justify the research and development investments. Thus, in equilibrium, prices are higher for orphan drugs that firms choose to bring to market than for other drugs.", ". The potential scope for these welfare losses increases if each indication is quite small and therefore unlikely to attract competition after patent expiration.", "The attractiveness of any market from the perspective of a new entrant is a function of the expected profitability of entry. For products targeting exceptionally small patient populations, the fixed costs of entry and the likelihood of intense post-entry price competition mean that a new entrant is unlikely to earn profits. This means that in the markets for some drugs targeted at small populations, a generic firm will never emerge \u2014 regardless of how high a price-cost margin the incumbent firm is able to charge. Evidence of this phenomenon can be seen in the nature of generic competition across orphan and non-orphan products in Figure 3. Approximately 50 percent of small-molecule non-orphan drug products have faced generic competition in the form of a competitor firm filing an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) \u2014 a necessary regulatory step for a firm to produce a generic product", ".6 However, a system allowing firms to charge different prices based on a consumer's value and willingness to pay for a product presents the ideal conditions for price discrimination.", "In summary, the economics of the pharmaceutical market are shaped in part by the scientific research and development process. As a result, changes in the nature and type of medications that can be developed can ripple through the entire system, impacting firms' innovation incentives, competition in pharmaceutical markets, and public and private drug spending. These changes can affect the optimal nature of decisions regarding the protection of intellectual property, as well as pricing strategies implemented by firms that themselves will dictate the welfare generated in these markets.", "Biomarkers can serve a variety of purposes in a clinical trial. Some, but not all, of these purposes may relate to precision medicine. For example, a biomarker can be included to measure the toxicity of a product across an entire population; this is valuable, but isn't especially relevant to targeting. When considering the economic evolution of the pharmaceutical market, we are primarily interested in trials that employ biomarkers for the purpose of identifying patient populations that are more (or less) likely to respond to particular medications. We therefore exploit additional information on the role of the biomarker in a trial to identify those related to products that we define as \"likely precision medicines\" (LPMs). Figure 1 depicts the growth in trials for these LPMs over time and shows an increase in their use across all phases of clinical development. In particular, there has been a marked increase in Phase I trials for LPMs in recent years.", "The pricing decisions of firms for different markets is summarized in Figure 5.8 Panel A contains a depiction of optimal pricing decisions for firms under the existing uniform pricing system for a product that treats three indications with differing efficacy. Under Scenario 1, patients with Indication C receive the least relative value of all patients. However, given the large size of this population, and the broadly high value they receive, a pharmaceutical manufacturer finds it optimal to set a price that causes insurers to allow these patients to access the medication. This relatively low price allows patients with Indications A and B to enjoy a relatively large amount of consumer surplus. In contrast, in Scenario 2 of Panel A, patients who have Indication C receive such a small amount of value from the product that the pharmaceutical firm finds it optimal to set a price that causes the insurer to limit these patients from accessing the drug", "The Economics of Drug Development: Pricing and Innovation in a Changing Market\nPricing and competition in pharmaceutical markets is an area of great debate and controversy, much of which stems from the fact that patent protection allows firms to charge high prices for potentially life-saving treatments. In the absence of patents, other firms would be attracted by the large profits earned by incumbent firms and enter the market. Such entry would likely raise current period welfare by reducing prices and increasing access to valuable medications.", "Figure 4, on the next page, demonstrates the role of market size in determining future competition. It shows the average peak demand in pharmacy claims data for orphan and non-orphan products based on the presence of an ANDA. These data come from OptumLabs and comprise all retail and mail-order pharmacy claims and inpatient and outpatient medical claims filed by United Healthcare beneficiaries between 1992 and 2017. The table demonstrates the importance of market size in determining competition. Products that never receive an ANDA have meaningfully smaller peak demand compared with those that face some form of generic competition.", "The lack of generic competition emerging to compete with branded products losing patent protection is currently limited to a relatively small number of drugs that target very small patient markets. However, as more and more firms develop precision medicines, the lack of generic entry in small drug markets could become a greater threat to future price competition across the entire market. Consider, for example, the case of Kalydeco (ivacaftor), which is a treatment for a subset of cystic fibrosis patients who also have a particular set of mutations. The likely patient population is estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000, and the drug costs several hundred thousand dollars per year. Despite the high prices, the small patient population means that it is unlikely that additional firms will attempt to target patients currently treated with Kalydeco.", "Though in some markets, firms are able to exploit forced bundling in insurance contracts to charge prices that exceed the value created by the products.

Hermosilla, and I find little evidence that truly novel products are affected by marginal changes to profitability, but this relationship warrants further study.9 In addition, little is known about the current incentives for firms to develop new biomarkers \u2014 particularly those that could decrease market size by providing more information about the optimal use of existing products.10\nEndnotes", "In a recent paper, Amitabh Chandra, Ariel Dora Stern, and I examine the degree to which the market is increasingly focusing on R&D activities related to precision medicines, and discuss the economic implications of such a shift in the product mixture.2 We first use data from the Cortellis Competitive Intelligence Clinical Trials Database (Cortellis), which is compiled by Clarivate (and formerly by Thomson Reuters) and contains all registered clinical trials from two dozen international clinical trial registries. Importantly for our purposes, these data contain detailed descriptions of the trials including the use and specific role of any biomarkers. At a high level, a biomarker is \"a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions,\" \u2014 that is, measurable features of a patient.3", "While the high prices for orphan drugs may represent an equilibrium based on the investment decisions of firms, as for other drugs, these high prices are only intended to exist while the product is under patent protection. For traditional, small-molecule drugs, the United States has long provided the policy framework to support a robust system of generic competition. While the United States still lacks a truly competitive post-patent market for complex biologic products (i.e. biosimilars), for small-molecule products the expiration of a patent is normally followed by generic entry and large price decreases. However, as technology allows for drug developers to target increasingly smaller patient populations, the future prospects for this competitive system are limited.", "After considering this simple example, it becomes hard to imagine how implementing indication-based pricing would result in reduced pharmaceutical profits or lower average prices. However, the welfare implications of indication-based pricing remain decidedly unclear. If the number of markets similar to Scenario 2 is large, then instituting indication-based pricing could be output-expanding. However, if most markets resemble Scenario 1, the primary effect of an indication-based pricing scheme would be to transfer value to firms. Again, the welfare implications of this transfer are unclear. Greater expected profits from such a system could increase the amount of innovation, as products that previously would not have generated sufficient profits to justify development are now worth more in expectation. However, the higher prices for each indication could reduce output \u2014 particularly if patients are exposed to meaningful cost-sharing based on the price of the product", "Profit-maximizing firms understand the benefits of potentially long-lived profits from products targeting these smaller patient populations. As a result, it may be optimal for firms to shift their attention away from products that create meaningful value for large patient populations but where future competition may quickly allow patients to capture that value. For example, Vertex (the manufacturer of Kalydeco) is developing several additional products that target cystic fibrosis patients with mutations \u2014 each of which will likely face little competition from generics or therapeutic substitutes. Future work should examine the degree to which firms are shifting research away from the larger market products that are more likely to receive meaningful competition in favor of these smaller markets that might offer larger and more long-lived profits.", "A body of research supports this tradeoff, showing a robust relationship between expected profitability of pharmaceutical products and investment in research and development.1 The trade-off is not intended to be permanent. After a period of time, patented products are meant to face additional competition that decreases prices, either through the introduction of therapeutic substitutes that engage in \"brand-brand\" competition that has a moderate effect on prices, or from post-patent generic competition, which drives prices even lower. The degree and nature of the eventual competition is dictated by a combination of policies and market forces.", "To understand the way in which indication-based pricing allows firms to price-discriminate, consider how pharmaceutical firms set prices for products that can be used to treat multiple conditions. For all drugs, prices are set based on negotiations between pharmaceutical firms and payers/pharmacy benefit managers. In most cases, a firm's optimal price is limited by the value a product creates, because an insurer must pass along the cost to patients via premiums.7 If pharmaceutical manufacturers set a high price relative to the value created for a specific indication, payers will implement utilization management programs that limit access to the product. For products treating multiple conditions, this ability for payers to restrict access requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to consider which segments of the market it will attempt to serve.", ". The decision to pick those conditions, which established the patient population threshold, was influenced by the then-existing technology and associated fixed costs for drug development.", "Recognizing this fact, many developed countries have implemented policies that provide additional incentives for products targeting small patient populations. In the United States, these policies took the form of the Orphan Drug Act (ODA), which provides both research and development tax credits, and allows extended periods of market exclusivity for firms developing products aimed at conditions afflicting fewer than 200,000 patients. These two policies are intended to shift the optimal investment threshold for firms. Passed in 1983, the ODA originally relied on firms demonstrating a lack of economic viability for a product, rather than a strict population limit. The 200,000-patient limit was added in 1984 and, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, was arbitrarily based on the prevalence of narcolepsy and multiple sclerosis", "Now consider the situation where a pharmaceutical manufacturer could charge multiple prices. For ease of discussion, Panel B presents a simplified version of this for the two scenarios discussed above, where firms are able to price at the maximum willingness to pay for each indication and consumers don't respond to a higher price through reduced utilization. In this case, the ability to charge multiple prices means that firms are able to capture far more surplus than they could under a uniform pricing system.", "The increasing percentage of LPMs in pharmaceutical development has clear economic ramifications. In particular, the ability to create these products changes optimal pricing policies, decisions about which drugs to prioritize in the development process, and the structure of existing government research and development incentives.\nOne area in which these scientific developments affect the market involves a firm's investment decision for products targeting small patient populations. Historically, there have been limited incentives for pharmaceutical firms to develop products targeting conditions afflicting relatively small numbers of patients. Since the fixed costs of research and development are broadly unrelated to the size of the potential pool of patients, firms generally find it difficult to invest profitably in products that create large amounts of value per patient but treat relatively few individuals.", "A.

Broadly speaking, these types of drugs are part of the evolving world of precision medicine. The ability of firms to develop such products is more than simply a scientific advancement or curiosity. A pharmaceutical market involving products targeting small patient populations has vastly different economic fundamentals than those that prevailed when the parameters of our existing intellectual property system were developed. This mismatch between public policy and the current reality of drug development has implications for both optimal policy and firm strategies.", "Beyond simply extending the time period during which firms face little or no competition, an increasing ability to develop products aimed at small patient populations could change a firm's optimal pricing strategy. If firms can more accurately predict a drug's ex ante efficacy \u2014 as is true for many precision medicines \u2014 they could develop more complicated pricing policies that allow them to capture more of the value they create. This is particularly true if a product can be used to treat multiple conditions with varying efficacy across these conditions. In these settings, firms may be interested in charging prices based on the indication-specific value created; this is often called indication-based pricing. Such a pricing system is promoted by many policy activists who believe that charging prices based on a product's indication-specific value will lower prices and reduce pharmaceutical profits", "In the 35 years since the passage of the ODA, advances in technology related to biomarkers, as well as developments in the understanding of the human genome, have changed the cost structure for firms developing products targeting small patient populations. Benjamin Berger, Nicholas Bagley, Chandra, Stern, and I examine the market for orphan drugs and the implications of changes in the ability of firms to develop these types of products.4 Orphan designations are a formal regulatory acknowledgement that a firm is attempting to develop a drug for a rare disease and is a necessary precursor to developing an approved orphan drug. In recent years, as Figure 2 illustrates, there has been a marked increase in the number of these designations \u2014 with a rapid increase in the United States broadly following the completion of the Human Genome Project.", "However, society enacts regulations that prohibit this entry in pharmaceuticals and other intellectual property-dependent markets, allowing high price-cost margins to exist for a period of time. Policymakers accept the reduced output from higher prices in order to provide appropriate incentives for firms to make large fixed-cost investments in new products. That is, there is an implicit trade-off in which some degree of current welfare is sacrificed in order to ensure strong incentives for future innovation.", ".

At close of trading on Oct. 14, 2022, that index was down 5% to 4,667. The broader S&P 500 was down 9% over that same period, so biopharma has outperformed the market since the unexpected resurrection of the IRA drug pricing provisions.", "snippets": ["Also supporting the notion of limited industry impact, the Congressional Budget Office, in a much-cited study, estimated that the IRA\u2019s provisions would have a nearly negligible impact on drug development, projecting a reduction of just 1% in new drugs coming to market over the next 30 years. The takeaway from that analysis seemed clear: Industry claims that price controls could stifle future innovation were nothing but typical alarmism.\nThe risks to drugmakers are significantly greater than many appreciate\nBeyond the generally well-known and understood impacts of the IRA, we believe there are three categories of risks to the industry that are underappreciated. When putting these together, we conclude that the emerging environment is quite treacherous for pharma and that the risks are greater than the market reaction to date would suggest.\nRisk category 1: Potential downsides in the IRA\u2019s implementation", "These differences provide a roadmap to areas of further risk. \u201cNow that mandatory negotiation is established as yet another tool the government can use, it is not unlikely that this mechanism also may be expanded over time,\u201d experts at law firm Latham and Watkins wrote. \u201cH.R. 3 contemplated that 50 drugs would be subject to negotiation every year, and it remains possible that subsequent legislation will increase the number of drugs or reduce the price cap.\u201d Policy advocates like Steve Pearson at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) are already making the case that Congress should tackle launch prices next.", "Further, newer drugs in categories with negotiated products may find themselves boxed out of Medicare coverage. The IRA requires health plans to cover any drug that has gone through the negotiation process. If there are two such drugs in a category, a Part D plan may not make space for other competing options, even for clinically compelling treatments.\nPutting these pieces together, one plausible scenario is a U.S. Medicare business that trends toward utilization management akin to Medicaid for pharmacy benefit therapies, especially outside of protected classes.\nRisk category 3: Further deterioration in the policy environment\n- Subjected at least 50 drugs to price controls each year\n- Incorporated international price referencing\n- Instituted price negotiation as early as launch, rather than allowing nine (small molecule) or 13 (biologic) years of pre-negotiation pricing\n- Made negotiated prices available to private insurers unless they opted out", "- There are several steps drugmakers should take to mitigate the risks associated with the IRA and the treacherous environment in which the industry finds itself.\nMost believe that the IRA\u2019s impact on the drug industry will be modest\nBefore Manchin\u2019s abrupt turn, the legislation that became the IRA was considered dead. So Manchin\u2019s announcement in late July was a significant disclosure of new information affecting the drug industry\u2019s earnings prospects. Yet equity markets reacted with a shrug. On July 26, 2022, one day before the announcement, the S&P Pharmaceuticals Index stood at 4,931. At close of trading on Oct. 14, 2022, that index was down 5% to 4,667. The broader S&P 500 was down 9% over that same period, so biopharma has outperformed the market since the unexpected resurrection of the IRA drug pricing provisions.", "With limited price flexibility post launch, drugmakers will look to optimize their launch pricing in the new environment to mitigate the IRA\u2019s downside impact where possible. In highly competitive categories like diabetes or immunology, the market will play a significant role in setting acceptable gross and net price thresholds. In oncology or rare disease categories, companies may look to set higher prices at launch than they otherwise would have absent the IRA. Those who do will need to tread cautiously, given the systemic risks of U.S. price controls making their way earlier into the drug life cycle.\nThere is already a significant spotlight on drug launch prices spurred by groups like ICER and by the research of opinion leaders like Rome, Egilman and Kesselheim who have pointed to large increases in drug launch prices over the past several years. While the research itself is quite shoddy, the talking point remains and drugmakers must expect a brighter spotlight on launch pricing.", "These ideas, questionable before the IRA, must be rejected more strongly now. When the length of time at peak sales is shortened, it becomes even more important to reach peak rapidly. A slow seven-year build to peak will leave precious few years of high revenue, especially for small molecule therapies. Companies that excel at launch may also find themselves the beneficiaries of less competitive small molecule markets if others who struggle to gain rapid traction choose to exit those categories.\nMake the difficult organizational investment and resourcing decisions\nCritical move 1: Rebalance the portfolio to move from safety to growth", "Second, while the IRA was intended to affect prices in Medicare, the mechanisms through which negotiated prices are realized in the marketplace may cause unavoidable spillover into other market segments. This is a risk particularly for medical benefit/Part B drugs. The law requires manufacturers to make negotiated prices available to providers who purchase drugs for usage in their facilities. However, there is no mechanism in today\u2019s marketplace for delineating between Medicare and non-Medicare patients at point of purchase. Further, even if such a mechanism emerged through the rule-making process, the average selling price of a negotiated drug would drop dramatically, leading to declining reimbursement in the private market and putting downward pressure on commercial prices. If these issues are not addressed in rule-making, Medicare negotiated prices may become the prices across the market", "Equity analyst reports have been consistent with this limited-impact story. They highlight the fact that the price negotiation provisions don\u2019t come into effect until 2026 and would be modest at first. They also argue that the Medicare Part D benefit redesign will be neutral or even positive for the industry, trading higher rebate obligations in the catastrophic phase with better patient access due to the new $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap. The view of Part D redesign as an industry opportunity is bolstered by the fact that pharma industry lobbyists have supported capping Medicare enrollee annual costs.", "The IRA impact is wide ranging, touching on disease area focus, clinical development strategy, pricing decisions, market access and distribution, to name a few. Further changes to the policy environment could affect many of these same areas. The set of possible policy changes or IRA implementation details is too broad to truly cover comprehensively. However, leaders must define a set of plausible scenarios that can be used to pressure test major decisions. For example, one scenario might have a reduction in the time window before price negotiation commences, while another scenario may contemplate spillover of the Medicare pricing rules into the non-Medicare business.", "The reality is the IRA will significantly impact both return on development programs and inorganic growth. The difference in negotiation window, inflation penalty, orphan protection and level of Medicare exposure will fundamentally alter how companies choose to rebalance their portfolio. Yes, there are many uncertainties around rule-making and implementation, but even conservative baseline assumptions already point to a reality that some existing development programs will no longer be viable. Companies will need to assess their current investments and focus areas in light of these emerging marketplace realities.", "So far, we have seen many organizations acting in a too-decentralized fashion. Different groups sometimes make different assumptions about the same dynamic. For example, business development forecasters, early asset forecasters and in-line forecasters may make different assumptions about net price growth given the IRA inflation price increase caps. Or an oncology franchise may make different assumptions than a general medicines franchise. Reconciling these sorts of differences will be burdensome enough with only a single baseline scenario. With multiple policy scenarios, some degree of centralized planning and management is essential.\nCritical move 2: IRA implementation policy advocacy\nThe risks laid out above yield a focused set of priorities for advocacy in the rule-making process for IRA implementation. Four such priorities are:", "The IRA legislation provides the frame for a new pricing regime in the United States, but lawmakers have left it to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to paint the full picture. The government is currently organizing itself for the implementation, and at this stage, the most salient details remain to be determined through the rule-making process and beyond. In those, two areas emerge as the biggest sources of potential downside beyond baseline expectations.", "Drugmakers are already gearing up to adapt to IRA implementation. We see companies updating their product forecasts, looking at their risk exposure and planning for the wide array of tactical activities that will be required to comply with the IRA. Beyond these necessary actions, we suggest three areas where companies should focus their energies and two critical moves in each:\n- Get the IRA response planning right.\n- Double down on launch effectiveness.\n- Make the difficult organizational investment and resourcing decisions.\nGet the IRA response planning right\nCritical move 1: Enterprise policy scenario planning", "Innovation and competition. One positive in the last two years has been a pivot in the return on internal R&D innovation investment, which has grown from less than 2% in 2020 to about 7% in 2022. This is in part due to efforts in enterprise trial optimization. But with the majority of innovation coming from emerging pharma, the cost of acquisition is increasingly in balance. As we know valuations have been at all-time highs, and inflation is only increasing. Every decision needs to be made with more scrutiny and a higher bar for success.\nWith the IRA and the strong likelihood of lower revenue potential per drug approved on top of the present economic environment, the equation is simple: Companies will need transformational change to reduce the R&D costs per approved drug, reduce commercialization costs or both.", "These scenarios should be developed with the full enterprise in mind, and planning should be done in a coordinated fashion, so that all stakeholders are starting from the same premises and assumptions. For major decisions, such as pivotal trial designs or product acquisitions, there should be sensitivity assessments across prioritized scenarios. Simply assessing decisions with a post-IRA baseline will not be enough to support long-range decisions.", "- Considering \u201ccousin\u201d molecules that are pursued separately and in parallel where starting the clock at first indication launch would damage LCM development\n- Reassessing biosimilar competition approach, given the two-year negotiation exemption\nStructure and deal choices:\n- For 2026 to 2028: Relying on single-product emerging pharma to shield value before the exception expires in 2029\n- Moving away from transaction structures that rely on price growth over inflation\nCritical move 2: Make the IRA a tipping point for cost containment and operating model change\nRemoving the IRA from the equation, the pharmaceutical industry is already in a moment of unprecedented economic pressure that has experts predicting a need to strip out over $30 billion in selling, general and administrative expenses by 2030. Some of the main drivers include:", "While impact to revenue, margin and cost varies by company and category, we already see companies feeling the pressure and pulling back on operational costs. But this will not be enough. The IRA can and should be the tipping point for leadership teams to pull the trigger on real and meaningful transformation in R&D speed and return, operating structure and talent and the commercialization model.\nBiopharma has a history of weathering challenges, from patent cliffs to category setbacks to reputational challenges, by innovating its way through the storm. While many will be tempted to lean on that legacy and watch and wait, we see the IRA as a call to action now\u2014both in how the industry navigates the law\u2019s implementation and in the bigger picture of the coming headwinds.\nAdd insights to your inbox\nWe\u2019ll send you content you\u2019ll want to read \u2013 and put to use.", "First, the statute describes a \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d that the HHS secretary is authorized to accept during drug price negotiations, but no details are provided about exactly how a price will be determined somewhere between $0 and that statutory maximum. Many impact assessments assume a baseline outcome of this price negotiation to be the maximum fair price. However, the structure of the negotiation rules provide few viable alternatives to drugmakers other than accepting whatever price the government offers, so there is significant downside risk of prices dropping below the maximum fair price. Below, we show how the IRA would affect cumulative life cycle revenue for four drugs under different price negotiation outcomes. Prices significantly below the statutory maximum can bring significantly greater value erosion.", "While the IRA sets a new baseline, drugmakers will have to contemplate scenarios in which more drugs are subjected to price controls earlier in their life cycles and in which other non-Medicare populations are incorporated into those controls as well. The IRA\u2019s passage also exists in the context of other negative policy changes for the industry both in the U.S. and beyond. In the U.S., gross-to-net risk continues to grow with the 100% cap on Medicaid rebates about to be removed and increasing costs from 340B rebates and co-pay accumulators/maximizers with little policy relief from these expenses. Outside the U.S., the worsening economic environment and health budgets put opportunity at risk, too. For example, Germany has just passed a law that will toughen the pricing environment dramatically.\nSteps drugmakers should take to mitigate the risks associated with the IRA", "Finally, some have noted that the scale of price controls ramps up slowly and the full impact will take several years to realize. While this is true, drug development and commercialization is a long game and by the time drugs in development today come to market, they will be operating in an environment where the lion\u2019s share of eligible Medicare spend will be subject to negotiation.\nRisk category 2: Deterioration in the market environment in response to the IRA\nWhile the headline change in the Medicare Part D benefit redesign is the introduction of a $2,000 out-of-pocket annual cap for patients, there is also a big change coming in cost responsibility by coverage phase. Most importantly, health plan responsibility in the catastrophic phase will be increasing from 15% to 60% as shown in the figure below.\nThis shift will induce significant behavioral change from the Part D plans. In our discussions with plan representatives, they pointed to the following expected behaviors:", "The industry has long struggled to tell compelling value stories that support their U.S. pricing decisions, often relying on high-level claims about research expenditure, disease burden, value and the need to encourage drug innovation. These bromides failed to stem the tide of the IRA, and they may fail again if a new Congress takes up launch pricing. Drugmakers need to develop much more compelling stories about the value of the innovation they are bringing to market and begin engaging more actively in pricing and value frameworks, lest those choices be made by others who appreciate pharma\u2019s positive impact less.\nCritical move 2: Launch aggressively and effectively", "Launching new drugs has become increasingly difficult in recent years, especially those that are not first in disease or in class with the clear majority of such treatments not meeting expectations. Even before the IRA\u2019s passage, early performance in launches has been challenged by slow payer coverage and by the long trend of degrading access to prescribers. Some have suggested setting less aggressive early performance expectations, potentially slowing down commercialization investment and evolving to more of a \u201cpay as you grow\u201d approach.", "Patent cliff. The next eight years represent the biggest impending patent cliff in industry history. Five of the top 10 biopharma companies have more than 50% of their revenues at risk. Adjusting for projected pipeline value through 2026 does little to avert the situation by company. While companies will make necessary maneuvers to blunt the effects, the big difference this time around is the science won\u2019t save the financial picture as it did when biologics followed the small molecule patent cliff. Exciting technology is launching, but with much different commercialization models, cost structures and margin profiles (for example, cell and gene therapies, platform technologies) than biopharma is used to with traditional assets.", "When President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law on Aug. 16, 2022, it was the culmination of a long, strange journey for legislation that had been debated for over a year. That it happened at all took most observers by surprise, as Sen. Joe Manchin acknowledged after he announced that he would back the bill.\nThe IRA contains significant provisions altering the landscape for prescription drug pricing and patient access in Medicare, as we covered here. The ZS Research Center has been studying this policy and its implications. In this article, we take a macro perspective on the impact of the legislation for biopharma. We will make three claims:\n- Most industry observers believe that the IRA\u2019s impact on the drug industry will be modest.\n- Those observers are wrong. The risks to drugmakers are significantly greater than many appreciate.", "Clarity. Drugmakers need clarity about how the Medicare price negotiation process will work. How will the drugs be selected from the list of eligible options? How will data about a drug be used in price determination? How will determinations such as the two-year biosimilar introduction likelihood be made? The more details can be laid out in rule-making versus being open to ongoing discretion, the better the industry can plan its own activities.\nReal negotiations. The lack of any price determination mechanism or price floors in the IRA coupled with the punitive excise tax creates the prospect of sham negotiations. Drugmakers should seek rules that ensure a good-faith negotiation process where drugs that demonstrate greater value will realize higher prices.", "- Dramatically more aggressive utilization management in high-cost categories\n- Narrow formularies for branded drugs\n- Expectation of higher rebates from manufacturers to partially offset new costs\n- Formulary distortions that will discourage many high-cost patients from enrolling\nMarket leaders in particular will experience a more difficult access environment in the new Part D world. We expect that many plans will prefer drugs with less market demand as a mechanism for reducing enrollment of patients with preexisting conditions. While Part D plans must include at least two drugs in each category on their formulary, they may select drugs with total market share of a few percentage points, rather than market leaders. Their new economics will strongly encourage those sorts of choices.", "Preserving a quality Medicare drug benefit. The new Medicare Part D benefit design places most of the burden for high-cost drugs on the Part D plans, increasing their cost share in the catastrophic phase from 15% to 60%. Health plan leaders have told us that this will lead to more aggressive and restrictive drug utilization management, as well as some potential distortions in which drugs are preferred on plan formularies. These changes risk limiting real-world access to the drugs that doctors are most likely to prescribe for their Medicare patients in leading categories. Drugmakers should advocate for high-quality Medicare formulary requirements and a limit to onerous utilization management protocols for nonpreferred drugs.\nDouble down on launch effectiveness\nCritical move 1: Strengthen new product pricing and value communication", ". This could increase the total downside of price negotiations by 25% to 50% in therapy areas that skew older (for example, medical oncology) and by 100% or more in therapy areas that skew younger (for example, immunology).", "Alnylam\u2019s decision to cull a promising phase 3 program to preserve the orphan disease exclusion (where the asset would not be subject to negotiation so long as it only pursued both a single indication and an orphan one at that)\u2014specifically cited by the company as IRA-driven\u2014is just a first public example of the kinds of adjustments that drugmakers must make now. This can potentially involve many parallel moves, including:\nPortfolio choices:\n- Pivoting from certain diseases (and by extension therapeutic categories) with potentially value-destructive negotiation potential\n- Shifting from \u201clong windup\u201d life cycle management (LCM) development to accelerating with shorter lead times between initial FDA approval and top indication authorization, even where risky\n- Deliberately reassessing the where and how of small molecule technology\nAsset/technology value choices:", "Containment to Medicare. The IRA passed the U.S. Senate under a reconciliation process where policy changes needed to affect the federal budget or they were excluded by the Senate parliamentarian. The extension of negotiated prices to commercial plans was removed from the IRA for this reason. Drugmakers should advocate that this principle be upheld in the law\u2019s implementation. This is a particular concern for medical benefit drugs where today\u2019s drug acquisition and reimbursement model does not allow for a neat delineation of Medicare and non-Medicare usage.", "Blockbusters and asset return. It\u2019s no secret that the number of blockbusters has been decreasing, making revenue recovery from the patent cliff more elusive without significant \u201casset as portfolio\u201d strategies or in the case of some rare gene therapies, structured geographic expansion. ZS analysis also shows that the return of any given blockbuster has lessened in the last five years versus the prior five years as well: 11% on average across categories and a whopping 47% less in oncology. At the same time, the average size of a launch molecule has gone down.

In particular, Williams suggested that more surrogate endpoints be adopted to shorten the length of these trials, increase investment in longer-term disease drugs, and speed the rate at which new drugs get to market. There was discussion on the challenges and benefits of such an approach. For one, validation of surrogate endpoints is often difficult and requires a substantial amount of study. Some participants noted that knowledge of good surrogate endpoints and reliable biomarkers are often endogenous, in that they depend on existing knowledge of certain diseases and on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 investment in certain types of drug research. There was discussion of the Framingham Heart Study and its value, including information on relevant biomarkers and surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular disease", ". Such access questions can be even more severe for smaller subsets of the population, particularly disadvantaged or marginalized groups. For example, large concentrations of prison inmates have Hepatitis C, but only around 1% of them have received treatment. On questions of equity, it was suggested that the savings from drug-price declines could be invested in wider public health initiatives, specifically things influencing the social determinants of health.", ". Anderson has asked the House Oversight Committee to review drug companies\u2019 proprietary information on how R&D money is actually spent. His previous research had found that the U.S. spends more on pharmaceuticals per capita than other OECD countries related to reasons other than actual drug innovation.", "Another participant pointed to the challenge of pricing a new drug. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are in constant discussion with distributors. The ongoing challenge is that the sickest patients subsidize healthier ones. More discussion is needed around value-based insurance design and a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket cost. The question for a pharmaceutical company, however, is how to set a price relative to volume, or the potential patient population. For example, for treating cardiovascular disease for 5 million people, pharmaceutical companies would want to know the goals: do they want to treat everyone? If not, what percent? There is a lot of interest among pharmaceutical companies to do these types of deals, but the mechanics are difficult. The presenters agree that pharmaceutical companies face uncertainties when setting the price; thus they stress that leadership matters. In Louisiana\u2019s case, the state set the goal of treating Hepatitis C", "Another key question in thinking about whether drug prices are too high is the extent to which innovation would respond to changes in prices. If innovation is limited by the number of scientists or by NIH funding, or if it is motivated by non-pecuniary rewards, then lowering drug prices wouldn\u2019t lead to fewer discoveries; it would simply lower profits in the pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that drug prices aren\u2019t high enough. The monopoly provided to pharmaceutical companies, through patents and exclusive marketing rights, is time-limited, meaning that some types of investments that might produce drugs whose value exceed their cost of development might not be pursued. Raising the return to these types of investment could improve social welfare.\nOverview of Session 2: Discussion of Louisiana\u2019s innovative Hepatitis C model", "Rena Conti of Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business summarized Louisiana\u2019s experiment for expanding access to a drug that cures Hepatitis C, a disease that is widespread among the state\u2019s Medicaid and prison inmate populations. Due to budget constraints, the state could not afford enough medication to treat the whole population. The solution, the governor and health secretary decided, was to try an alternative to the fixed-priced-per-pill model. The state offered the makers of the drugs\u2014there are three\u2014an approach that reflects the fact the marginal cost of producing each additional pill is very small. Dubbed a Netflix-style subscription model, the state asked the drug maker to offer a flat fee that would cover the drugs necessary to treat all of Louisiana\u2019s Medicaid and prison population over a five-year period. (Shortly after our conference, the state announced it would contract with Asegua Therapeutics Inc., a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences Inc", ". Both sides (the state and the drug companies) had rights and responsibilities. If the pharmaceutical companies were willing to take part, then it was the state\u2019s responsibility to treat people. One participant noted that the public won\u2019t benefit if drug companies are successfully pressured into lowering prices, but the states neglect their responsibility to see that sick residents are treated. The presenters argued that replicating the Louisiana model elsewhere is possible. Another participant emphasized the importance of coordination and leadership, and asked what would bring pharmaceutical companies to the table.", "Discussants pointed out that coordination with the government is important. Both Washington and Louisiana worked closely with CMS. In fact, participants pointed out, Louisiana wanted a waiver originally, but CMS is limited what it can waive, according to Section 1115. They said that obtaining a waiver is challenging, in general. Instead, Louisiana and Washington leveraged Medicaid\u2019s supplemental rebate program, which has been in place in almost every state for years, so the idea is not new. Following that path is a way for other states to replicate Louisiana\u2019s and Washington\u2019s models. The difficulties in replicating what Louisiana and Washington are doing, they pointed out, are problems with leadership and infrastructure.\nSession 3\nHeidi Williams\u2019 slides", "Introduction\nOpening remarks: Louise Sheiner\nLouise Sheiner\u2019s slides\nLouise Sheiner of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy stated that the goal of the conference was to have a wide-ranging discussion among the various stakeholders in attendance of policies to lower prescription drug prices without unduly harming innovation. She thanked the Arnold Foundation (at the time; now Arnold Ventures) for the idea to hold the conference and the funding to support it. She then provided an overview of the issues to be discussed in each of the three sessions.\nOverview of Session 1: Discussion of the social value of new drugs being developed", "Anderson noted that R&D isn\u2019t done in-house at large pharmaceutical companies, but is done by others and purchased later. A lot of early-stage drug research is done at academic medical centers financed by government grants. Smaller venture-backed biotech firms carry out phase 1 and phase 2 drug trials. Large drug companies later purchase the drug, carry out or finish phase 3 trials, and market and sell the drug. Anderson cited Gilead and its Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi. In the case of Sovaldi, researchers at Emory University carried out the basic research, which was funded by NIH. Venture capital firms financed the next round of research and drug trials under a spin-off known as Pharmasset. NIH and venture capital funds invested about $200 million each in the company. Gilead purchased Pharmasset in 2012 for about $10 billion", ". Some noted a desire to fund a new Framingham-type study but for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in order to come up with new surrogate endpoints. Most agreed that this would be a powerful resource, but argued that it would be expensive, given that survey respondents would need to get medical imaging regularly throughout the course of the survey. It was noted that electronic health records may already have some of the data needed to do such research, particularly for data prior to reforms implemented in 2015. Others noted that research into biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s was already underway and could provide relevant hypotheses for such a study. For example, recent research looked at the buildup of brain plaque in Alzheimer\u2019s patients as a potential biomarker", "Presenters pointed out that the subscription model idea came from a two-part report from the National Academies of Medicine (phase 1 and phase 2). Although the approach was unique, Australia experimented with a similar model, using budget caps. The government stated that it was spending $1 billion on a drug, and companies were invited to help treat as many people as possible.", "Louisiana\u2019s ability to avoid best price rules for Medicaid and its choice not to impose price controls were deemed particularly important. Participants agreed that this type of negotiation can be more difficult for private insurers because of Medicaid\u2019s best price rule, which requires that Medicaid be able to purchase drugs at the lowest price paid by any buyer. In a subscription model with an up-front payment and the rest paid for by rebate, Medicaid could claim that the best price is zero. Then every Medicaid program could demand the drug at zero costs, a possibility that obviously scares off drug makers. In other words, Medicaid\u2019s best price rule can rule interfere with value-based purchasing or innovation. Louisiana also avoided price controls, which can doom certain types of innovation or therapies in perpetuity. For example, the Ryan White Program with HIV drugs made sense at the time, but over time it prevented innovation in HIV drugs.", "David Cutler of Harvard University sought to answer whether there is currently too little or too much innovation in the pharmaceutical arena. He split drugs into three categories: those that are actively helpful and provide a consumer surplus (i.e. the benefits are worth the costs), those whose price equates, more or less, to their total benefit, and those that actively do harm. In the first category, Cutler put Hepatitis C drugs and drugs used to treat cardiovascular disease. He noted that the elderly, who often suffer from cardiovascular disease, have seen a slower rate of growth of real per capita health spending than had been projected in the late 1990s and early 2000s. At the same time, hospitalization rates for patients with cardiovascular diseases, both with and without a prior history, had fallen since the later 1990s. Cutler\u2019s research shows that these drugs had improved health outcomes for the elderly population without significantly increasing costs", "Another issue in replicating the Louisiana approach is the difference between acute/infectious disease and chronic disease. For example, HIV drugs are usually not one single drug, but a cocktail of drugs that are taken forever by the patient. As a result, it would be difficult to coordinate with several manufacturers for drug purchases and pricing, especially if drug resistance develops among a patient and the cocktail needs to be modified. Additionally, budget constraints would be different for each participant. Although value-based insurance is proposed as a solution for the latter point, evidence around value-based insurance design experiments is mixed. Participants also commented that the subscription model is a move away from value-based pricing. Instead, it is a budget-based negotiation, which isn\u2019t a bad thing\u2014but the two concepts are different, and talking about them together can be confusing.", ". An alternative option of offering lengthier patent rights for longer-term drugs from inception is illegal under WTO rules, making reforms difficult. It might be possible to get around the rule by offering different exclusivity terms rather than different patent terms, but nothing in the space has been attempted so far. There was discussion of delaying patent publications until drugs were actually approved, since pharmaceuticals is one of the few industries where firms can\u2019t sell drugs for which they have patents while they wait for FDA approval. There was some pushback against this idea, though, as a change in the rule could cause distortions in other markets, such as technology. So-called \u2018submarine patents,\u2019 instances where there is a long delay in the publication of a patent from the date of issuance, have caused problems in the past where they led to major disruptions for competitors who had been using the patent technology prior to when the patent \u2018surfaced", "Overall, there was significant support for the paper\u2019s use of systematic empirical methodology to study incentives. In particular, it was noted that the research proves that incentives for investment in drug R&D are not some unknowable or unmeasurable phenomena but can be studied with detailed empirical analysis. While Williams acknowledged that the observational nature of the data used in the research did not prove anything definitively, the intent was to rigorously test an economic theory with data to inform the debate.", "Sheiner noted that the question of whether drug prices are too high is probably too broad to be answered with a simple yes or no. Drug prices in some areas may be too high, because the kinds of innovation being developed are not worth their cost, but too low in others. In particular, the paper by Heidi Williams of MIT discusses why there might be too little R&D devoted to treating diseases with long survival times. Because the FDA generally requires clinical trials proving a drug\u2019s effectiveness be completed before a drug is approved, drugs for which clinical trials are long are more costly and effectively shorten the exclusivity period for innovating firms. This is particularly a problem for drugs aimed at treating diseases with long survival times, as it takes many years to know whether these drugs are effective", "Anderson cited drugs for rare diseases, sometimes referred to as orphan drugs, as an example of a policy success, at least in part. Drugs are available to treat only about 5% of the roughly 5,000 rare diseases \u2013 defined by the government as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. To incentivize research, the Hatch-Waxman Act offers a 25% tax credit on R&D (cut from 50%, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and longer market exclusivity for orphan drugs. Orphan drug approvals have tripled since 1980.", ". For the second and third categories, Cutler used a tool from the Sloan Kettering Drug Pricing Lab, a drug price abacus, where one can evaluate the price of a drug relative to its social benefit. According to those statistics, there are numerous drugs whose marginal value are at or below their marginal cost. Cutler cited opioids as a prime example of the type of drug that is actively harmful and not worth the cost.", "Conti was asked whether the threat of the state invoking a century-old patent law, known as Section 1498, was a lever to get the drug companies to the table. (Section 1498 allows the government to use what amounts to its power of eminent domain to circumvent patent protections, provided the patent holder is fairly compensated.) She replied that 1498 was not new; it has been on the table as an option for almost 100 years. And it remains part of the toolkit.", "Session 1\nDavid Cutler\u2019s slides\nGerard Anderson\u2019s slides", "Beyond Louisiana, participants discussed Washington state, which is implementing a similar program. Washington had a two-part bidding process instead of a unified process. One part focused on the Medicaid population, which was like Louisiana\u2019s model; the other part focused on the general population covered by the state, including state employees and the incarcerated. This looked like a standard volume discount approach. The discussants thought that the real innovation in Louisiana was in its implementation\u2014Louisiana did not require waivers. It went through the process for Medicaid best price practices and leveraged 340(b) capabilities. Washington did not do the same.", "Cutler also spoke about \u2018Me-Too\u2019 drugs, new drugs that are chemically or structurally similar to existing drugs. In general, the benefit of these drugs is the competition they bring to the market, rather than an improvement in treatment technology. Greater competition initially transfers rents from pharmaceutical companies to consumers. While there can be distributional consequences of this transfer, there is no welfare gain if there is no change in access or affordability. However, the greater access to drugs that should come from sufficiently lower prices spurred by competition should lead to an overall gain in welfare. This is an important distinction. Most of the increases in net social welfare come from increased access rather than lower costs. The costs of this welfare gain stem mostly from the cost of R&D necessary to create the new drugs, but the size of the tradeoff is unclear and often poorly measured", "While these prices create profits that enable pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investments, the high prices put the drugs out of reach for many patients. Although developing new drugs entails large fixed costs, producing more of them is generally relatively cheap. Thus, some kind of two-part pricing scheme, whereby the firm charges the monopoly price on the monopoly quantity of drugs, and then a lower price on any additional quantity of drugs sold, can benefit both the drug provider and the consumer. There are many variants on this two-part pricing scheme, all of which involve negotiation over both prices and quantities. One prominent example is the innovative model developed by the state of Louisiana to deal with the development of drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni to cure Hepatitis C", ". Cutler\u2019s research shows that between 2008 and 2016, much of the increase in costs for brand name drugs was due to higher prices, while increases in the costs of generics and specialty drugs was due to the introduction of new drugs.", "In discussing tradeoffs between regulation and future innovation, some participants noted that certain policies may meaningfully reduce innovation and investment in new drugs by reducing the marginal incentive to invest in R&D. Such policies might include shorter patent life, taxes on drug profits, and mandated payments to NIH for funding initial research. A second type of regulation, though, may affect the profits of pharmaceutical companies without harming the marginal return to innovation\u2014for example, getting rid of tax write-offs for research into new drugs or increasing the corporate tax rate. In other words, it\u2019s possible to tax rents, reduce deadweight loss, and increase access without affecting the quantity of useful drugs being produced on the margin. In many cases, firms do not appear to be meaningfully cash constrained, so if policymakers avoid affecting the return on investment on the margin, they can still regulate prices without decreasing innovation.", ". Anderson questioned whether this form of financing was optimal, whether it sways researchers to pursue one type of drug or form of research over another, and whether this structure has essentially led to a bidding war for promising drugs. In particular, while some premium on the drug is needed to cover the larger fixed costs of financing R&D and failed drug trials, the large profit margin in the case of Sovaldi implies that substantial rents are being extracted.", ". Though this particular indicator had not been widely adopted, existing research had only looked at patients who had already developed brain plaque, rather than looking at patients before they began to develop plaque; in other words, research in this area seemed to still be preliminary. Others noted that certain biomarkers can be very drug-specific and hard to generalize for broad approval ex ante. While this may be true, the case was also made for more generalized indicators that aren\u2019t company-specific, and might provide sufficiently broad benefits to receive public research funding: for example, blood pressure as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease or tumor shrinkage for cancer.", "Williams and her coauthors studied whether there is systematic underinvestment in longer-term research projects by looking at late-stage versus early-stage cancer treatments. The FDA generally requires that clinical trials showing a drug\u2019s effectiveness be completed prior to a drug being approved, creating long lags between invention and commercialization. This lag is particularly large for drugs treating forms of cancer with long survival times, since these need longer clinical trials to determine whether they are effective. Williams and coauthor argue that this requirement discourages firms from investing in longer-term research, particularly in drugs, because these lags decrease the de facto exclusivity period for innovating firms.", "Gerard Anderson of the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health focused on financing R&D and innovation in pharmaceuticals. In particular, he noted that the sunk costs of R&D should not be treated as a justification for price increases on the margin, since the costs already have been incurred by companies. This is, however, the reason often used in political conversations, particularly by pharmaceutical lobbyists. Citing statistics from the Tufts Center for Drug Development, Anderson noted that real R&D costs have increased by 7.9% per year since the 1990s, to $2.6 billion in 2014. According to the study, about 40% of this is the cost of capital, which is priced at about 10.5%. The direct cost of developing a drug is therefore closer to $1.3 to $1.6 billion, including the cost of failed drug trials. Anderson expressed concern that this money may not be spent directly on R&D, i.e. on more scientists and equipment", "More generally, there was broad agreement on the lack of available data or standards for measurement in health overall. On the demand side, quality adjustments and value of life calculations are not standardized, but can dramatically influence the price of a drug, particularly in insurers\u2019 negotiations over prices with drug manufacturers. Existing measures of quality, for example, may be too generalized: the value of one more year of additional life for a terminally ill patient may be lower than reducing the probability of a cardiac event for a prime age person who can return to work. The SEER database was mentioned as a good source of drug data. It suggests that the median drug is providing a relatively high value on a quality-adjusted cost basis.", "Sheiner noted that economists don\u2019t really know whether drug prices are too high, making policies aimed at lowering them hard to evaluate from a social welfare perspective. Higher prices increase the incentive for investment in new drug development, but also create affordability problems, resulting in less access to drugs or to health insurance more broadly (if high drug prices raise insurance premiums). One question, then, is whether the drugs that are developed on the margin are worth their cost. If consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for drugs exceeds the marginal value they get from them (perhaps because of insurance coverage, mandated drug coverage, or physician preferences), then lowering drug prices and lowering innovation at the margin could improve overall welfare.", ". In other scenarios, though, the approval process can be difficult, given the ambiguousness of trial results. Certain cases that don\u2019t involve thick tails in patient responses based on a small sample size make it difficult for the FDA to assess the validity of trials using surrogate endpoints. Some standards therefore seem in order. Others argued that even if such approvals were made, allowing drugs to come to market faster, pharmaceutical companies are often still expected to complete the clinical trials through to their endpoints, which is costly. This may be because other countries also have stricter international standards for surrogate endpoints than the U.S.", ". The de facto requirement that diseases with longer survival time have longer clinical trials means that drug companies have much greater incentives to invest in treating diseases with short survival times, leaving some diseases under-researched relative to the social optimum. Because of this, Williams did not advocate lengthening exclusivity periods (which would increase R&D incentives for all drugs) but rather for ways to shorten clinical trials. One such option is by finding ways to increase the use of surrogate endpoints, biological markers that show a drug is working and that can proxy for the ultimate clinical endpoint (remission from cancer or death, for example). In addition, Williams thought that tax credits for research in diseases with long survival times might be useful.", "Beyond the costs and incentives for future R&D, there was also discussion of consumer price elasticity, and how much price changes would affect access. It was noted that, given how low utilization is of clearly beneficial drugs, any policies that could increase underused drug use would provide huge value, particularly since they could allow producers to lower prices by increasing volume (a foreshadowing of the discussion of the Hepatitis C program in Louisiana in the second session). It was suggested that currently, many consumers are price insensitive, since pharmaceutical companies provide coupons and patient assistance programs so that patients don\u2019t directly bear the cost of drugs. However, some old data suggests that increasing the monthly cost of drugs at CVS by $10 led to 5-10% of people not filling their prescriptions, implying a high price elasticity", "To test their theory empirically, the authors looked at clinical trials for cancer treatments from 1973-2011 and patient survival data from 1973-2004, by cancer and patient types. They found that patient groups with higher survival rates had fewer clinical trials, a finding that implies that longer commercialization lags decrease R&D. To get at causality, Williams and coauthors also found that this relationship does not exist for types of cancers that use surrogate endpoints in drug trials. (A surrogate endpoint is a measure of a treatment\u2019s effectiveness\u2014like a shrinking tumor, for example\u2014that can be detected sooner and is a good proxy for an actual clinical endpoint, in this case the clinical endpoint being death.) In other words, types of cancers that allow for such endpoints and therefore have shorter commercialization lags do not have fewer clinical trials. This is particularly shown with hematologic cancers that have more surrogate endpoints for trials", "Conti viewed this as both an equity issue and an innovation issue. Pharmaceuticals receive government assistance for R&D through government grants and research cooperation. Such was the case for Gilead\u2019s Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which was funded by NIH, as Anderson pointed out in his earlier presentation. But Conti suggested innovators receive a disproportionate amount of the windfall. Taxpayers indirectly support innovators through the tax system and should have access to the fruit of this innovation. What Louisiana has done is shift the discussion towards allowing everyone to gain access to public health.", "Anderson offered several possible policy responses. One option would be limits on the portion of a drug\u2019s purchase price that is tax-deductible. Another would be for the government to seek a price reduction on a final drug if the government had a role in financing early stages of research. The Bayh-Dole Act provides a way for the government to receive a price reduction, but all five requests made to NIH on these grounds have been rejected. Changes to such a policy should consider whether the policy would affect the choice of research for NIH-funded grants, as well as what the appropriate return on investment should be for NIH-funded research.", ". Sheiner noted that, although at current market prices these cures are believed to save money over the long run, poor states like Louisiana that have to balance their budgets annually are unable to afford treatment for most of the Hepatitis C patients in their care (Medicaid beneficiaries and state prisoners, for example). Thus, there is the potential for negotiations between the drug manufacturers and the state to benefit both parties, with the drug manufacturers selling more drugs than they otherwise would, and Louisiana able to treat more patients.", "One open question: If a change in regulation led to less R&D, would that lead to less overall innovation? In other words, are firms at the flat end of the R&D supply curve, where small changes in investment have little effect? There were also questions about the amount of rent being extracted by large pharmaceutical companies. Several participants noted that R&D costs (equipment, scientists, etc.) are relatively low, but real R&D spending has increased on net over the past few decades. This begs the question as to where the money is being spent\u2014for example, on protecting intellectual property rather than on innovation that acts to extract monopoly rents.", "Session 2", "States have the potential for innovation and authority in this area, but the infrastructure for establishing health policy is lacking in many states. The secretary of health and the head of the state Medicaid program are typically the only officials focused on public health issues. The solution is to build up the public infrastructure at the state and local level. The CMS State Innovations Model Initiative (SIM) was a breakthrough in giving resources to the states and in thinking about health policy at a local level. One participant pointed out that the problem may come back to pricing. Louisiana is a poor state that couldn\u2019t treat its people. This was clear to pharmaceutical companies. In a richer state where there is room for negotiation, would pharmaceutical companies be as willing to negotiate? Does that make replicability harder? Discussants answered that global companies have made different arrangements with different countries\u2014and could do the same with different states.", "There was discussion of patent rights and drug exclusivity periods. Williams noted that her research showed, regardless of the overall length of patent exclusivity, investment in longer duration drug trials appears to be lower than investment in shorter duration drug trials for any given length of overall exclusivity. Therefore, some relative incentive to invest in one type of research relative to another is needed. The Hatch-Waxman Act, for example, includes provisions designed to provide relative incentives for different types of research by varying the length of patent extensions for different types of research. However, in practice all companies that applied for the extension got the same 5-year exclusivity extension, regardless of the type of research they were doing. This did not fix the shortfalls in financing for types of drugs trials relative to each other", "Despite the potential for large rents, participants noted that other firms participating in the R&D process, particularly small venture capital-funded biotech firms, require a higher return due to the considerable amount of risk involved at early stages of R&D. Many of these firms aren\u2019t extracting rents and may be run by former scientists who need financial incentives to provide proof of concept for certain drugs. Changes in the marginal return of R&D therefore could meaningfully shift investment flows into these small firms. Due to the lack of data on R&D costs, it was noted that it is difficult to assess what return on investment would be reasonable for the R&D process for different firms, particularly to cover the cost of failed drug trials.", "On innovation, some participants pointed to flaws in the FDA\u2019s benefit and risk framework for drug approval, noting that the focus is on the \u2018indicated patient\u2019 for a certain drug rather than on the entire population with a given disease. For example, a drug that decreases the probability of a heart attack on the margin and therefore saves thousands of lives each year might get less attention from the FDA than a drug that definitively saves a few lives by curing a particular disease. This creates distortions in the incentive for regulation. In addition, the regulatory framework does not focus on the negative externalities of drug approvals, with opioids being the most obvious example.", "Overview of Session 3: Discussion of incentive distortions arising from the current patent and market exclusivity system for new drugs", "While Me-Too drugs can drive up prices without providing as much value add, several participants noted that Me-Too drugs sometimes provide additional benefits outside of the existing drugs, particularly if they cater to a broader range of patients. For example, some Me-Too antidepressants are more like new drugs, since they may work for a subset of patients where the existing drug does not; for these type of Me-Too drug trials, biomarkers help predict how different patients will react. Some argued that many drugs are mislabeled as Me-Too drugs when these new drugs in fact have different characteristics and receptors. There are benefits to having multiple options to treat the same disease, since this may allow for treatment of a heterogenous patient population. Indeed, many drugs in production that end up as Me-Too drugs may not have been intended to be such. Similarly, some Me-Too drugs are improvements over existing drugs (more like \u2018Me-Betters\u2019) based on other metrics", ". The authors argued this is evidence that the fact that there is less R&D for types of cancers with longer survival rates is not the result of more difficulty in scientific discovery. In addition, they found that the negative correlation between survival times and R&D (measured by the number of clinical trials) is consistent both for public and private investment, but is larger for private firms than for the government. They explored various policy options in the paper and endorsed expanding the number of approved surrogate endpoints and providing targeted R&D subsidies for projects with longer commercialization lags.", "For the Medicaid population, the state is using the existing Medicaid supplemental rebate program. For the prison population, the state is making expanded use of the 340(b) programs, a federal program that provides discounts to hospitals and clinics that serve low-income or uninsured patients. Both had precedent, which was important politically, and neither threatened the Medicaid \u201cbest price\u201d rule, because manufacturers were not required to factor Medicaid pricing or purchasing entities with 340(b) status into their best price calculation. The state did not need to seek a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).", "Williams and coauthors developed a theoretical model whereby drug companies conduct research subject to cost constraints related to the patent exclusivity period, the commercialization lag, competition from generics, and various other factors relative to some social optimum. In the model, private firms systemically underinvest, both in terms of the level and composition, in R&D relative to the social optimum, particularly for projects with long commercialization lags.", "., to provide the medicine, beginning July 1, 2019.) The presenters cited two reasons why Louisiana became a leader in this field. The first was that a high proportion of its population is infected with Hepatitis C. (It also has a very high HIV rate.) The second was the leadership demonstrated by the governor and the secretary of health, who viewed the state\u2019s Hepatitis C problem as a pressing public health challenge.", "General Discussion", "Discussants also noted difficulty with regulation that may prevent companies from adopting surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. The FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research sets standards for approval of new molecular entities. There was some critique that the CDER\u2019s approval of surrogate endpoints was nonsystematic, with many well-documented biomarkers underused and standards for others that were used ill-defined. It was noted that even if the bar for approval of surrogate endpoints was set high, there could still be significant value in providing clarity and certainty around the approval process. For example, the FDA said they would approve, at some point in the future, HPV incidences as an indicator for cervical cancer vaccines. Even though the action was not imminent, clarity around future policy shortened the length of trials and changed the cost profile of research for the drug, leading to new drugs being brought to market faster", "Josh Sharfstein of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health added that Louisiana conceptualized the problem as a public health challenge and not a drug pricing challenge. Hepatitis C is curable, but many do not have access to the necessary drugs. Sharfstein recounted Peter Bach\u2019s conclusion that it would be cheaper for the government to buy Gilead and make the drug accessible than to buy its products at market prices. Sharfstein suggested that Louisiana has found a path to address this public health challenge. He gave credit to the companies for participating, and said it reflects their recognition that people who can\u2019t afford medication can and should benefit from the fruits of innovation.\nGeneral Discussion", "Nevertheless, there are still many diseases without drugs, and many of the orphan drugs that do make it to market turn out to be blockbusters. Six of the top ten selling drugs in Medicare have orphan designations. The average cost of developing an orphan drug is about $19 million, with wide variation. Costs are significantly lower for more successful drugs since they have shorter trials and have the potential for about $2 billion in revenue. Orphan drugs can be especially profitable since pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) usually put only one drug on their formulary, and doctors may hesitate in prescribing generics for orphan drugs due to fear of malpractice. Therefore, there seems to be a bias towards large blockbuster drugs with huge profit margins with orphan status\u2014potentially not the best way to encourage broad innovation.\nGeneral Discussion"], "title": "Striking a balance: Drug prices, profits and incentives for innovation"}]}]}]
