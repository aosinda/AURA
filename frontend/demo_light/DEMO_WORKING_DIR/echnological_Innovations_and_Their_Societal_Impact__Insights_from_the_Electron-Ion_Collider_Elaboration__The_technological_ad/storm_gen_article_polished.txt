# Scientific Significance

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) stands at the forefront of nuclear physics research, promising to address some of the most profound questions about the universe's fundamental structure. This advanced facility will explore the intricate dynamics within protons and neutrons, probing the interactions of quarks and gluons that compose these particles. One of the EIC's main objectives is to provide high-precision, three-dimensional snapshots of these elementary particles, thereby deepening our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that governs the strong nuclear force [1][2].
A significant mystery that the EIC aims to resolve involves the origin of mass in visible matter. Remarkably, it appears that 99% of the mass of nucleons and, by extension, the mass of all visible matter, arises from the interaction energy among quarks and gluons, rather than from the particles' intrinsic masses. The EIC's investigations will elucidate this phenomenon, offering insights into how massless gluons and nearly massless quarks generate substantial mass through their interactions [3].
The concept of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is another critical area of study for the EIC. As gluons fluctuate within the vacuum, they may reach a saturation point, forming a unique state of matter characterized by dense, glass-like walls seemingly suspended by time dilation effects. The EIC will play a crucial role in either confirming or refuting the existence of this novel form of matter, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge regarding gluon behavior [3][4].
The EIC will also be the world's first polarized electron-proton collider, where both beams' spins can be aligned in a controllable manner. This feature will enhance the precision of experiments, enabling more detailed exploration of particle interactions [4].
