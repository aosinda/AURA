In conventional X-ray therapy, portal imaging of the MV treatment beam is offered on many machines, and is a valuable tool to monitor therapy and to support online dose calculation . The combined MR-Linac provides excellent image quality during therapy , which is also under research for particle therapy .", "This \u2018\u2018interplay effect\u2019\u2019 degrades the target coverage, generating cold- and hot-spots  (Supplementary Video 2). Treatment of moving targets in particle therapy therefore requires motion management techniques aiming to either reduce the anatomical motion (e.g. breath holding or abdominal compression) or to adapt the treatment during planning or delivery (e.g. 4D treatment planning , tracking).", "Due to the additional degree of freedom provided by the range of the particles inside the patient, tracking can be performed either only laterally or also in depth, but tracking alone does not regain dose conformity in irregular motion scenarios . In addition, as noted above, conformal radiotherapy needs robust optimization and, for proper handling of organ motion, this means 4D robust optimization . These approaches have now been tested both for protons  and carbon ions [133\u2013135], the latter being further complicated by the problem of non-linearity of the RBE-weighted"], "title": "Emerging technologies for cancer therapy using accelerated particles - PMC"}, "https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=116998": {"url": "https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=116998", "description": "One-of-a-kind facility at Brookhaven Lab will open up a new frontier in nuclear physics", "snippets": ["The collider-accelerator infrastructure that powers the EIC at Brookhaven will also be available to researchers who use particle beams to produce and conduct studies on medical isotopes and to study the effects of simulated space radiation with the aim of protecting future astronauts."], "title": "Department of Energy Selects Site for Electron-Ion Collider | BNL Newsroom"}}}
