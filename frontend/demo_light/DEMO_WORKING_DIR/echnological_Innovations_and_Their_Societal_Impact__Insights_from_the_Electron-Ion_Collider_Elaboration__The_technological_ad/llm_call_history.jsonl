Unlike X-rays, the energy deposited per unit track length increases with depth (Fig. 2), therefore for a single beam the dose to the normal tissue will be much lower for ions than for photons when delivering the same dose to the tumor.\n[5]: By contrast, proton therapy delivers a beam of proton particles that stops at the tumor, so it\u2019s less likely to damage nearby healthy tissues.\n[6]: Cumulative evidence shows that microenvironmental conditions play a significant role in the regulation of cell functions, and how cells respond to these conditions are of central importance to regenerative medicine and cancer cell response to therapeutics. Here, we develop a new method to examine cell mechanical properties by analyzing the motion of nanoparticles in living in mice, combining particle tracking with intravital microscopy.\n[7]: For projects that don't match the EIC Accelerator topics, the EIC Accelerator Open is open to proposals in any field of technology.\n[8]: Visionary Programme Managers \u2013 in collaboration with various experts from across the European tech ecosystem \u2013 guide and connect portfolios of EIC projects and companies in support of major technological goals.\n[9]: They provide a technology layer to passport credit histories across borders through one single API. In most cases, the companies will receive the grant financing within the next three months, while the investment decisions depend on the urgency of the companies\u2019 needs. \u00b7 A further 273 applications that were assessed positively by the EIC jury, but for which there was insufficient funding available, will be awarded a Seal of Excellence.\n\nNow give your response.

Since 2000, scientists have used Brookhaven\u2019s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to explore the characteristics of nuclear matter, discovering unexpected details about what matter was like in the very early Universe.\n[3]\nWhere is the remaining 99%? Astonishingly, it appears to come from the interaction energy among the proton\u2019s inner building blocks. In fact, it looks like the nucleons, nuclei and, by extension, all the planets and galaxies of the visible Universe get their mass through interactions of massless gluons and almost massless quarks. How does this happen? The Electron-Ion Collider will resolve this profound and longstanding mystery.\nThe Electron-Ion Collider will explore this mystery. ... Fig 3: The number of gluons in the proton increases with energy. Theory predicts it must saturate to form a novel gluonic form of matter called the Color Glass Condensate. Discovery and detailed study of CGC is one of the primary goals of the EIC\n[4]\nAbstract:This White Paper presents the science case of an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), focused on the structure and interactions of gluon-dominated matter, with the intent to articulate it to the broader nuclear science community. It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan.\nIt contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required to achieve them, and it benefited from inputs from the users' communities of BNL and JLab. This White Paper offers the promise to propel the QCD science program in the U.S., established with the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and the RHIC collider at BNL, to the next QCD frontier.\n[5]\nThe science of that force is well understood but we still know little about the microcosm within the protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nucleus. That\u2019s why Brookhaven Lab is building a new machine\u2014an Electron-Ion Collider, or EIC\u2014to look inside the nucleus and its protons and neutrons.\nAll information technology\u2014and much of our economy today\u2014relies on understanding the electromagnetic force between the atomic nucleus and the electrons that orbit it. The science of that force is well understood but we still know little about the microcosm within the protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nucleus. That\u2019s why Brookhaven Lab is building a new machine\u2014an Electron-Ion Collider, or EIC\u2014to look inside the nucleus and its protons and neutrons.\nThe EIC will be a particle accelerator that collides electrons with protons and nuclei to produce snapshots of those particles\u2019 internal structure\u2014like a CT scanner for atoms. The electron beam will reveal the arrangement of the quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons of nuclei. The force that holds quarks together, carried by the gluons, is the strongest force in Nature.\n[6]\nNuclear physicists and cosmologists may use beams of bare atomic nuclei, stripped of electrons, to investigate the structure, interactions, and properties of the nuclei themselves, and of condensed matter at extremely high temperatures and densities, such as might have occurred in the first moments of the Big Bang. These investigations often involve collisions of heavy nuclei \u2013 of atoms like iron or gold \u2013 at energies of several GeV per nucleon. The largest such particle accelerator is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nThe electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays. The reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the radiation beam produced has largely supplanted the older use of cobalt-60 therapy as a treatment tool. In the circular accelerator, particles move in a circle until they reach enough energy. The particle track is typically bent into a circle using electromagnets.\nCurrent accelerators such as the Spallation Neutron Source, incorporate superconducting cryomodules. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and Large Hadron Collider also make use of superconducting magnets and RF cavity resonators to accelerate particles.\n[7]\nThe charge on the proton and electron are exactly the same size but opposite. Neutrons have no charge.\n[8]\nElectric fields spaced around the accelerator switch from positive to negative at a given frequency, creating radio waves that accelerate particles in bunches. Particles can be directed at a fixed target, such as a thin piece of metal foil, or two beams of particles can be collided.\nElectron-beam applications center on the modification of material properties, such as the alteration of plastics, for surface treatment, and for pathogen destruction in medical sterilization and food irradiation. Ion-beam accelerators, which accelerate heavier particles, find extensive use in the semiconductor industry in chip manufacturing and in hardening the surfaces of materials such as those used in artificial joints.\nThere are two primary roles for particle accelerators in medical applications: the production of radioisotopes for medical diagnosis and therapy, and as sources of beams of electrons, protons and heavier charged particles for medical treatment. The wide range of half-lives of radioisotopes and their differing radiation types allow optimization for specific applications.\n[9]\nAs gluons flit in and out of the vacuum, multiplying and recombining, scientists suspect they may reach a steady state of saturation called a \u201ccolor glass condensate.\u201d This unique form of nuclear matter gets its name from the \u201ccolor\u201d charges that mediate the interactions of the strong nuclear force, and the dense, glasslike walls these particles are thought to form in nuclei accelerated to nearly the speed of light, seemingly suspended by the effects of time dilation. Scientists will use the Electron-Ion Collider to search for definitive proof of whether this form of matter exists, and test the limits of gluons\u2019 ability to expand beyond the bounds of a single proton/ neutron inside a nucleus.\nThe Electron-Ion Collider would be the world\u2019s first polarized electron-proton collider where both the electron and proton beams have their spins aligned in a controllable way.\n[10]\nThe weaker a mode of interaction is, the higher luminosity is required to reach an adequate measurement of the process. The luminosity is inversely proportional to the product of the beam sizes of the two colliding species, which implies that the smaller the emittances of the beams, the larger the luminosity.\n[11]\nSuch a beam could thus theoretically be used to treat deep-seated cancerous cells with limited harm to the surrounding tissues. This is promising news for the medical technology community for a variety of reasons: VHEE beams produced by compact linacs in clinical settings would not only offer a more cost-effective alternative to other particle beam therapies but would also provide doctors with a highly reliable medium, as their scattering in inhomogeneous tissue is limited.\n\nThe topic of the page: echnological Innovations and Their Societal Impact: Insights from the Electron-Ion Collider Elaboration: The technological advancements required to build the EIC have the potential to inspire future innovations in various fields.

The most cursory examination of improvements in cancer outcomes since the 1940s reveals the positive impact of innovative technologies across the spectrum (Nathanson, 1943), from new forms of classic chemotherapy, which can now cure many childhood and adult haematological malignancies, to advances in surgical technologies (e.g.\n[2]\nThe proposals should focus on development of smart integrated devices where the competitive advantage may lie in the system approach or in one of the key components or technologies. ...

In support of the EU Soil Mission, the EU Green Deal, Farm to Fork strategy, Fit for 55 and REPowerEU policy actions, the key goal of this Challenge is to support the production of sustainable and nutritious food from precision fermentation and algae. Innovations must go beyond incremental changes to the state of the art and deliver novel production processes that must deliver energy and resource efficient, low emission foods that are integral to a healthy diet.\nThe European Innovation Council work programme 2024 opens funding opportunities worth over \u20ac1.2 billion for strategic technologies and scaling up companies. The majority is dedicated to SMEs and start-ups to develop and scale up \u201cdeep tech\u201d innovations in critical fields such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), space, critical raw materials, semiconductors and quantum technologies.\nThe aim of this Challenge is to foster a European, human-centric approach to AI, tackling prevalent issues like transparency deficit and trust inadequacy.\n[3]\nEmerging technologies are often expensive and, therefore, initially limited to society's richest. A key part of technological progress is making these life-changing and often life-saving innovations affordable for everyone.\nAlmost every development we cover on Our World in Data is underpinned by technological change. Medical innovations contributed to the decline in child mortality and the improvement in life expectancy. Thanks to the advances in agricultural technologies, higher crop yields and less undernourishment became possible.\nTechnology has improved our lives in many ways, but these developments are not always positive. Many of humanity\u2019s largest threats \u2014 such as nuclear weapons and potentially artificial intelligence \u2014 result from technological advances.\n[4]\nTechnologies and innovations like CRISPR, artificial intelligence, telehealth, the Infinium Assay, cryo-electron microscopy, and robotic surgery are helping accelerate progress against cancer.\n[5]\nAdvanced technological solutions that would enable to apply cell-based therapies to treat patients in a personalised/precision manner. Single cell-based approaches (analysing DNA, RNA, epigenetic marks, proteins, metabolites used in combination with single cell sequencing, single cell imaging and spatial profiling) in particular to allow to map the presence of individual cells in the tumour environment. New technological solutions including lab-grown cancer organoids or organs-on-a-chip which would allow to test the patient\u2019s response to various cell therapies and drugs, alone or in combination, prior to the initiation of the treatment, are sought.\n[6]\nKeywords: cancer therapeutics, emerging technologies, nanomedicine, computational imaging, cellular stress, radiosensitizing, exosomes \u00b7 The transformative impact of technological advances on cancer research featured prominently at the 54th annual meeting of the Irish Association for Cancer Research (IACR). Translational research is advancing its enormous potential at breakneck speed, as mature applied technologies meet with the innovations of multi-disciplinary research groups.\nNew therapeutic strategies involving areas like energy metabolism and extracellular vesicles along with advances in immunotherapy and nanotechnology are driving the next generation of cancer treatments. The development of fields such as theranostics in nanomedicine is also opening new doors for targeted drug delivery and nano-imaging. Here we discuss the use of innovative technologies presented at the Irish Association for Cancer Research (IACR) Annual Meeting, highlighting examples of where new approaches may lead to promising new treatment options for a range of cancer types.\n[7]\nIn addition, the technological advances already under development to make the EIC a reality\u2014e.g., innovative accelerator, particle tracking, and data-management components\u2014could have widespread impact on new approaches to cancer therapy, solving other \u201cbig data\u201d challenges, and improving accelerator facilities for testing batteries, catalysts, and other energy-related materials.\nThe collider-accelerator infrastructure that powers the EIC at Brookhaven will also be available to researchers who use particle beams to produce and conduct studies on medical isotopes and to study the effects of simulated space radiation with the aim of protecting future astronauts.\nThe world-leading science that an EIC will achieve and the technological advances needed to make it a reality have the potential to power the advanced technologies of tomorrow, benefiting health and medicine, national security, nuclear energy, radioisotope production, and industrial uses of particle beams.\n[8]\nToday, cancer research focuses on innovative cell therapies, anti-tumor vaccines, and biotechnological drugs, promising to redefine cancer treatment . Surgery's historical involvement in oncology, spanning thousands of years, was characterized by limited success and elevated rates of morbidity and mortality until around 150 years ago when anesthesia and antiseptic methods were introduced. In the past five decades, a notable shift in approach has taken place, highlighting the importance of multimodal therapy, technological advancements, and minimally invasive techniques to reduce the necessity for radical surgical procedures.\nIntegrative medicine combines evidence-based complementary therapies, lifestyle interventions, and conventional treatments to optimize health, reduce modifiable risk factors, and address the physical and emotional aspects of cancer. Such an approach may include herbal medicine, stress reduction practices, supplements, and physical therapies tailored to the individual patient's needs. By addressing modifiable factors like stress, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and vitamin deficiencies, oncologists can contribute to better overall patient health and improved treatment outcomes . ... Innovations and technological advancements have played a pivotal role in reshaping the landscape of modern healthcare, particularly in the realm of oncology.\n[9]\nAdvancements in cancer therapy are increasing survival rates and offering hope for a cure to more people. We are now treating cancer more precisely and with fewer side effects.\nMany people are familiar with proton beam therapy, which is a highly precise radiation treatment that destroys cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Proton therapy has been found to cause fewer side effects. Though this technology was approved decades ago, refinements continue to improve its usefulness in many tumor types. The next advancement in radiation therapy is something known as carbon ion therapy.\n[10]\nThe rationale for particle therapy lies in its physical properties. Unlike X-rays, the energy deposited per unit track length increases with depth (Fig. 2), therefore for a single beam the dose to the normal tissue will be much lower for ions than for photons when delivering the same dose to the tumor.\nThis \u2018\u2018interplay effect\u2019\u2019 degrades the target coverage, generating cold- and hot-spots (Supplementary Video 2). Treatment of moving targets in particle therapy therefore requires motion management techniques aiming to either reduce the anatomical motion (e.g. breath holding or abdominal compression) or to adapt the treatment during planning or delivery (e.g. 4D treatment planning , tracking).\n[11]\nThe electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays. The reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the radiation beam produced has largely supplanted the older use of cobalt-60 therapy as a treatment tool. In the circular accelerator, particles move in a circle until they reach enough energy. The particle track is typically bent into a circle using electromagnets.\n[12]\nThese resistant tumours contribute to making the disease one of the main causes of mortality worldwide, but the scientific community is teeming with ideas to make cancer fatalities a thing of the past. Among the latest medical and technological innovations, progress in particle therapy \u2013 the process of irradiating tumours using highly energetic particle beams generated by a particle accelerator \u2013 allows the treatment of tumours that would otherwise have been fatal.\n[13]\nThis study highlights the various nanocarriers and compounds that can be used for selective tumor targeting and the inherent difficulties in cancer therapy. Nanotechnology provides a promising platform for improving cancer detection and treatment in the future, but further research is needed to overcome the current limitations in clinical translation.\nAlthough diverse nanocarriers have traversed preclinical phases and garnered approvals for human trials, a mere fraction have secured authorization for clinical deployment, particularly those with molecular moieties designed for selective cancer cell interactions .

Many of humanity\u2019s largest threats \u2014 such as nuclear weapons and potentially artificial intelligence \u2014 result from technological advances.\n[3]\nThis is a list of emerging technologies, which are in-development technical innovations that have significant potential in their applications. The criteria for this list is that the technology must: Exist in some way; purely hypothetical technologies cannot be considered emerging and should be covered in the list of hypothetical technologies instead.\n[4]\nWe asked the World Economic Forum's new class of Technology Pioneers for their views on how technology will change the world in the next five years - this is what they told us.\n[5]\nNuclear physicists and cosmologists may use beams of bare atomic nuclei, stripped of electrons, to investigate the structure, interactions, and properties of the nuclei themselves, and of condensed matter at extremely high temperatures and densities, such as might have occurred in the first moments of the Big Bang. These investigations often involve collisions of heavy nuclei \u2013 of atoms like iron or gold \u2013 at energies of several GeV per nucleon. The largest such particle accelerator is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nSmaller particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of applications, including particle therapy for oncological purposes, radioisotope production for medical diagnostics, ion implanters for the manufacture of semiconductors, and accelerator mass spectrometers for measurements of rare isotopes such as radiocarbon. Large accelerators include the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and the largest accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland, operated by CERN.\nIt is a collider accelerator, which can accelerate two beams of protons to an energy of 6.5 TeV and cause them to collide head-on, creating center-of-mass energies of 13 TeV. There are more than 30,000 accelerators in operation around the world. There are two basic classes of accelerators: electrostatic and electrodynamic (or electromagnetic) accelerators. Electrostatic particle accelerators use static electric fields to accelerate particles.\nThe electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays. The reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the radiation beam produced has largely supplanted the older use of cobalt-60 therapy as a treatment tool. In the circular accelerator, particles move in a circle until they reach enough energy. The particle track is typically bent into a circle using electromagnets.\nCurrent accelerators such as the Spallation Neutron Source, incorporate superconducting cryomodules. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and Large Hadron Collider also make use of superconducting magnets and RF cavity resonators to accelerate particles.\nLinear accelerators are also widely used in medicine, for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. Medical grade linacs accelerate electrons using a klystron and a complex bending magnet arrangement which produces a beam of energy 6\u201330 MeV. The electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays.\n[6]\nMore than 10 000 small electron linear accelerators (linacs) are currently used for cancer treatment worldwide. Most of these machines rely on photon beams generated by electrons to irradiate their target. Some, however, use the electron beam itself for direct low-energy electron irradiation, although this can only reach superficial tumours. These methods differ from hadron therapy, a technique based on irradiation with protons or heavy ion beams.\nSuch a beam could thus theoretically be used to treat deep-seated cancerous cells with limited harm to the surrounding tissues. This is promising news for the medical technology community for a variety of reasons: VHEE beams produced by compact linacs in clinical settings would not only offer a more cost-effective alternative to other particle beam therapies but would also provide doctors with a highly reliable medium, as their scattering in inhomogeneous tissue is limited.\n[7]\nElectric fields spaced around the accelerator switch from positive to negative at a given frequency, creating radio waves that accelerate particles in bunches. Particles can be directed at a fixed target, such as a thin piece of metal foil, or two beams of particles can be collided.\nLinear accelerators propel particles along a linear, or straight, beam line. Circular accelerators propel particles around a circular track. Linear accelerators are used for fixed-target experiments, whereas circular accelerators can be used for both colliding beam and fixed target experiments.\nElectron-beam applications center on the modification of material properties, such as the alteration of plastics, for surface treatment, and for pathogen destruction in medical sterilization and food irradiation. Ion-beam accelerators, which accelerate heavier particles, find extensive use in the semiconductor industry in chip manufacturing and in hardening the surfaces of materials such as those used in artificial joints.\n[8]\nSupported by ~US$1.6-2.6 billion in funding from the US Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science and $100m from New York State, this new world-class research facility will collide high energy electrons with protons and the nuclei of heavier atoms such as gold to produce precision 3D snapshots of quarks and gluons \u2013 the building blocks of all visible matter \u2013 and unlock the secrets of the strongest force in Nature.\nNew Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) components (including an electron accelerator, red, and electron storage ring, blue) will fit inside the tunnel that currently houses the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC, yellow).\n[9]\nThe ion beam emittance may be decreased via various methods of beam cooling, such as electron cooling or stochastic cooling. In addition, one must consider the effect of intrabeam scattering, which is largely a heating effect. An electron\u2013ion collider allows probing of the substructure of protons and neutrons via a high energy electron.\n[10]\nOrthogonal X-ray fluoroscopy with or without markers and combined with different motion models can be used to track the tumor position. In conventional X-ray therapy, portal imaging of the MV treatment beam is offered on many machines, and is a valuable tool to monitor therapy and to support online dose calculation . The combined MR-Linac provides excellent image quality during therapy , which is also under research for particle therapy .\nThis \u2018\u2018interplay effect\u2019\u2019 degrades the target coverage, generating cold- and hot-spots (Supplementary Video 2). Treatment of moving targets in particle therapy therefore requires motion management techniques aiming to either reduce the anatomical motion (e.g. breath holding or abdominal compression) or to adapt the treatment during planning or delivery (e.g. 4D treatment planning , tracking).\nDue to the additional degree of freedom provided by the range of the particles inside the patient, tracking can be performed either only laterally or also in depth, but tracking alone does not regain dose conformity in irregular motion scenarios . In addition, as noted above, conformal radiotherapy needs robust optimization and, for proper handling of organ motion, this means 4D robust optimization . These approaches have now been tested both for protons and carbon ions [133\u2013135], the latter being further complicated by the problem of non-linearity of the RBE-weighted\n[11]\nThe collider-accelerator infrastructure that powers the EIC at Brookhaven will also be available to researchers who use particle beams to produce and conduct studies on medical isotopes and to study the effects of simulated space radiation with the aim of protecting future astronauts.\n[12]\nNCI, the Department of Energy, the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, and a transdisciplinary group of investigators are using AI to advance development of digital twins for people with cancer. Others use it to analyze imaging data and electronic health records to tailor patients\u2019 radiation doses. AI is even being harnessed to quickly analyze population-based cancer data and estimate the probability of certain cancers. And these examples just scratch the surface\u2014AI has the potential to truly transform cancer care.\nWhile the robotic arms may look straight out of a futuristic movie, in a setting where just millimeters could stand between removing all cancerous tissue and potentially injuring healthy tissue, their fine, precise motions can make a world of difference.

This advanced facility will explore the intricate dynamics within protons and neutrons, probing the interactions of quarks and gluons that compose these particles. One of the EIC's main objectives is to provide high-precision, three-dimensional snapshots of these elementary particles, thereby deepening our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that governs the strong nuclear force [1][2].\nA significant mystery that the EIC aims to resolve involves the origin of mass in visible matter. Remarkably, it appears that 99% of the mass of nucleons and, by extension, the mass of all visible matter, arises from the interaction energy among quarks and gluons, rather than from the particles' intrinsic masses. The EIC's investigations will elucidate this phenomenon, offering insights into how massless gluons and nearly massless quarks generate substantial mass through their interactions [3].\nThe concept of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is another critical area of study for the EIC. As gluons fluctuate within the vacuum, they may reach a saturation point, forming a unique state of matter characterized by dense, glass-like walls seemingly suspended by time dilation effects. The EIC will play a crucial role in either confirming or refuting the existence of this novel form of matter, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge regarding gluon behavior [3][4].\nThe EIC will also be the world's first polarized electron-proton collider, where both beams' spins can be aligned in a controllable manner. This feature will enhance the precision of experiments, enabling more detailed exploration of particle interactions [4].\n\n# Technological Innovations\n\nThe Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) embodies a fusion of cutting-edge technologies designed to push the boundaries of scientific research and yield significant societal benefits.
