I\u2019m a bit confused about the deadlines you mentioned. Can you clarify?\nCheers,\nNatalie\n6. Could you expand on your thoughts regarding\u2026?\nAsking someone to expand on their thoughts indicates genuine interest in understanding their perspective more deeply. It\u2019s polite, respectful, and encourages more detailed communication. This is particularly effective in brainstorming sessions or when discussing ideas with team members or mentors via email.\nExample:\nHello Dr. Jenkins,\nYour last email brought up some interesting points about sustainable energy solutions.

Discussion questions that ask learners to share what they already know about a new idea, problem, or related concept, can be an equally impactful way to get the conversation flowing.\nDiscussion questions focused on uncovering what learners already know have several solid advantages:\n- Position learners as active participants in knowledge creation and sharing, rather than passive receptacles waiting to be taught new information\n- Reduce barriers to participation in the discussion; you don't have to come up with an innovative idea to have something worth sharing", "Traditionally, law enforcement has served as the community\u2019s first line of defense against criminal behavior, but many are beginning to question this model.

What form might it take?\nAsk Fewer Questions, but Better Ones\nIt can be hard to know which questions will resonate with students and which will fall flat, but avoid the temptation to pepper the discussion board with questions to see what will stick. This will overwhelm students and result in less participation, not more.\nInstead, ask fewer questions, but spend your time crafting truly great ones that appeal to students\u2019 higher reasoning skills and spur meaningful discussion.", "Give students something to argue about. Questions designed to create dissent encourages to construct arguments and formulate opinions, and students will have to actively synthesize the material to form and support an opinion.\nWhile controversy is the quickest way to spark a long and passionate online discussion, be careful when introducing sensitive subjects. Learning forums should be a safe space for all students to express ideas without feeling threatened or subjugated due to their race, gender, orientation, or religious beliefs. Controversial questions will require heavier instructor moderation to ensure that the conversations stay civil.\nTo introduce an element of controversy into your discussions:\nCreate questions that challenge common orthodoxies:", "Great discussion questions:\n- Are clear and easy to understand. Avoid acronyms and scholarly language. Most students will not spend five minutes just trying to decipher what you\u2019re asking.\n- Foster a dialogue. Beyond just having no single right answer, a good discussion question leaves room for people to not just answer the question differently but build on those answers to create a back-and-forth discussion as well.\n- Are inclusive. Everyone in the class should be equally prepared to answer the question, no matter what their background.

In some cases, learners are eager to participate but don't feel comfortable doing so.\nIt's not hard to see why. The internet isn't always the kindest place, and sharing new ideas or opinions can make people vulnerable to a Twitter-style pile-on. As instructors we need to find ways to help the less confident share their thoughts.", "These questions draw students in because they allow them to apply their own perspectives and personal histories to the course materials. The answers can bring out strongly held opinions, which are usually the basis of healthy debates. A productive discussion can encourage students to question their assumptions and learn about alternate perspectives.\nTo help students relate to the discussion questions:\nAsk for examples from students\u2019 lives:\nGive an example of a time that you witnessed racial inequality. How did it shape or alter your worldview?\nDiscuss timely issues:\nLast year, over 5,000 species were moved to the list of endangered animals.

Check out the course here.\nRunning an online discussion board is a very different challenge from having a classroom discussion. In-person instructors can ask discussion questions on the fly, rephrase themselves for clarity, and direct the flow of a conversation with follow-ups. Online, you only have one shot to ask a discussion question that catches students\u2019 interest and compels them to speak up.\nThe stakes are higher than you think. Sad, empty discussion boards, just like a reliance on dry online lectures, lead to disengaged students and lackluster online experiences.", "Tap into students\u2019 higher reasoning skills by posing questions that require them to critically think about course materials to draw their own conclusions. Instead of just regurgitating information, students will have to first apply what they\u2019ve learned to the problem and then make connections by questioning, comparing, and organizing their ideas.\nTo create analytical discussion questions, root your query in the required readings and lectures. Be careful not to slide into questions with a single right or wrong answer; instead, give students room to interpret and evaluate facts as they craft an argument. This will also create space for discussion as students compare their conclusions.\nHere are some examples of discussion questions that encourage analytical thinking:\nAsk students to critique an author\u2019s argument:\nAre the theories that Darwin presented in 'On the Origin of Species' anti-religion?\nAsk students to compare two theories:", "The way we phrase our discussion questions and prompts can help achieve that aim:\nSet Ground Rules Up Front\nAt the start of your discussion exercise, or at the top of the discussion board, make the rules of engagement clear. You may want to ask participants to avoid 'personalizing' an issue, or state what kind of language is unacceptable.\nUse Unbiased Language in Your Questions\nGender neutral language ('salesperson' rather than 'salesman') and inclusive pronouns ('they/them') might help some people feel more welcome in the discussion. Remove any gender-specific or race-specific phrases in your discussion questions to make sure no one feels like they're not qualified to join the discussion.\nLeverage Smaller Discussion Groups", "Who was the more influential Victorian poet, Tennyson or Hardy?\nHave them find a better way to do something:\nTraditionally, election polling has been conducted solely over the phone.

Likewise, you can encourage discussion participation by writing questions that tie to current events or issues that are important to students.", "- Give instructors an insight into existing knowledge, so we can tailor upcoming exercises accordingly\nThese kind of discussion questions work best when framed similar to a think-pair-share exercise, according to the Designing for Learning blog. Ask learners to share \"what they think and where, when, or how they might have heard about a concept, person, idea or related event\".\nFor example, questions that ask learners to share prior knowledge might be framed as:\n- \"What do you already know about this topic? What do you want to know?\"\n- \"Agree or disagree with the following statement, and explain why your prior knowledge justifies your opinion\"\nThese kind of questions work best at the beginning of a new module or topic.\nEncourage Analysis", "Divergent thinking, the ability to consider many possible solutions instead of just one, is the key to a lively discussion board. While it\u2019s important to assess students\u2019 comprehension of the course materials, creating questions with a single right answer shuts down discussion before it starts.\nConsider Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy of knowledge, which illustrates different levels of learning and understanding. The bottom of the pyramid represents the most basic levels of learning, where thinkers converge on one correct answer. The top of the pyramid, the higher level of learning, is where learners\u2019 diverge to create their own unique answers.\nAvoid questions that utilize only the bottom three layers of the pyramid: remember (fact recall), understand (explain concepts), and apply (use information to solve or interpret). These techniques are great for tests or essay assignments, but they won\u2019t create debate, conversation, or original thought.", "Regardless of how confident your learners are, sometimes discussion boards just get too unruly to engage with. To avoid a situation in which the discussion becomes confused, try breaking your learners into smaller discussion groups and asking them to answer questions that way. Eduflow's discussion activity, for example, allows you to separate learners into smaller groups to create a safer learning environment.\nAsk for Opinions\nIf the internet has taught us anything, it\u2019s that everyone has opinions, and people love sharing them. Tap into this almost primal instinct by getting students talking not just about what they know but also about what they believe.\nAsking for opinions forces students to employ higher-level evaluation skills to justify their arguments. These questions require students to evaluate materials, create arguments, and defend those stances with facts and theories.\nTo create questions that require students to take a stance:\nAsk them to compare two things:", "- Align with the course objectives. Just because something is interesting or would spark a lively debate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s relevant to the course. Your ultimate goal is to encourage students to use and apply the course materials, so your questions should align with that aim.\nWriting Great Discussion Questions Is Only Half the Battle\nFor most students, participating in class discussions is a calculated risk. They\u2019re putting their carefully constructed arguments and deeply held opinions on the line, with a real possibility of criticism from their peers. You can encourage more participation and discussion by mitigating that risk and creating a welcoming space for students to share. After you\u2019ve posed your killer question, continue to moderate and guide the discussion to keep it flowing civilly.\nThis can be daunting in a very large online class, but an LMS with good moderation features, like the ability to section students into smaller discussion groups, can help.", "Great discussion questions do more than just test comprehension: They turn students from passive receptors of knowledge into active participants in their education.\nTo push students into exercising higher-level thinking, write discussion questions that pull from the top of the pyramid:\n- Analyze: Ask students to examine, classify, or question course materials to draw their own conclusions.\n- Evaluate: Ask students to form an opinion and defend it; critique or appraise course materials.\n- Create: Ask students to use what they\u2019ve learned to construct something new.\nAvoid closed-ended questions, such as those that ask students to list characteristics, define terms, explain concepts, or recall facts. Once the correct answer has been given, there isn\u2019t much more to say, so the discussion fizzles out.", "On the flip side, active discussion boards can elevate an online class from okay to extraordinary. Studies show that participating in classroom discussions reinforces knowledge retention through active learning and strengthens students\u2019 critical-thinking skills.\nIf you can get a real discussion going between students, then you can reap the benefits of community and collaborative learning, even if your class never meets face-to-face.\nTo do this, you will have to look beyond the dry writing prompts and uninspired reading-comprehension questions that so often sink a conversation before it begins.

Socratic Seminar Variations\nSocratic Seminar might be one of the most important instructional discussion strategies that an ELA teacher can learn and implement in her classroom. The driving force of a socratic seminar? INQUIRY.\nHow it works:\nTo develop a seminar, Amanda from Mud and Ink Teaching recommends starting with an Essential Question. Essential Questions are questions that guide units of study and illicit genuine curiosity and further inquiry from students (check out this blog post for a head start or her course to learn more!).", "Share this slide with students through Google Classroom as an assignment using the Students Can Edit option. Once students are in the slide together (up to 50 can work together at one time), instruct them to write their name on one rectangle. That rectangle will be theirs to click and drag.\nNow, the fun begins! Read a multiple choice question slowly and carefully so all students can hear the question and answer choices. Read answer choices a second time if necessary. Then, tell students to move their rectangles to choice A, B, C, or D.\nTo add drama and excitement, you could give students who volunteer the opportunity to place their rectangles and explain their thinking before letting the whole class loose!\nAfter finishing your human bar graph, be sure to discuss patterns and what those patterns might reveal.\nWhy it works:", "This discussion strategy can easily be modified to fit online formats. To modify the fishbowl discussion virtually, teachers can use this digital Socratic Seminar Google resource to help students engage in a meaningful, socially-distanced or Zoom classroom conversation.\nStudents can volunteer to join the discussion, and as they discuss the questions (which can also be posted in the chat feature), the students who are listening can take notes about what each speaker says and contributes to the discussion.\nAnd that makes TWELVE meaningful teacher- and student-tested conversation modes for middle and high school students.

Quality discussion skills are often not intuitive. We can explicitly teach students about the nuances of eloquent conversations by scaffolding and modeling. Gradually, as students internalize these concepts and they become second nature, students will be more independent.\n8. Gallery Walks\nIn the spirit of co-creating learning, Tanesha (@love.tanesha) uses gallery walks to engage students around essential topics and to build background knowledge.\nHow it works:\nThere are several ways to organize gallery walks, which depend on the desired outcome and topic. Teachers can create gallery walks by arranging a mix of photos and images around the room in stations. Students are grouped and rotate between stations with a specific focus. One of the most important considerations is having enough rich content for students to engage with that invites divergent thinking and conversations.", "I wanted to compile a fresh list of inspiration for online discussions, so I reached out to some of my middle and high school teacher friends around the web.

Silent Discussions\nSilent discussion strategies have been gaining momentum in the physical classroom, but they are also convenient for online discussions.", "Before social distancing, Emily from Read it. Write it. Learn it. used the Human Bar Graph by placing A, B, C, and D labels at the front of the classroom. Emily would display a question with four possible answer choices on her SmartBoard. These choices could be opinions (agree/disagree) or fact based (one correct answer) options. Students would then stand in a row at their answer forming a Human Bar Graph.\nVirtual options:\nNow, Emily uses the Human Bar Graph digitally. It takes some prep work, but once it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll have it to reuse over and over. You can save time by grabbing a pre-made version here.\nTo create a Human Bar Graph, open a Google Slide with a custom page setting of 8.5\u00d711 inches. Post a question at the top and A, B, C, D answer choices at the bottom. Insert a rectangle just small enough for a student to write their name. Then, right click and copy and paste enough rectangles on the page for the number of students you have in class.", "When it comes to configuring students into different formats (both virtually and in-person), the sky is the limit.\n7. Question Stems + Sentence Frames\nHave you ever sent students into a discussion and they were done in the blink of an eye? An integral aspect of any of these discussion strategies is student readiness.\nStaci (@DonutLovinTeacher) often asks her students to engage in Socratic Seminars, digital discussion boards, or in Book Clubs. However, before expecting students to know how to have these kinds of discussions, Staci and her students examine the impact of types of questions and responses.\nHow it works:", "To better support all of her students, Staci has conversations with her students about types of questions. Staci shares different kinds of questions with her students and asks them to look through previous assignments to find examples. Based on a short video or text, they practice asking different kinds of questions and her students are able to see first hand how the questions lead to very different discussions.\nFurthermore, Staci finds it valuable to provide and practice using different kinds of sentence frames that will help students \u201cthink out loud.\u201d When students share their thinking with others, respectfully of course, it can push the entire conversation forward in meaningful ways. Leave these frames up in a digital or in-person setting for students to reference throughout the discussion. Sometimes a little preparation and support can go a long way!\nWhy it works:", "Simply create a slideshow with one slide for each small group and change the sharing permissions to \u201cAnyone with the link can edit.\u201d Once students have the link, they\u2019ll be able to type on their group\u2019s assigned slide as they discuss the prompt in small groups.\nWhy it works:\nThe best part? The slides are easy to monitor in real time using the Grid View in Google Slides. This allows teachers to see the overall discussion activity in one single view and check in on groups that may need additional prompting. You can learn more and grab Shana\u2019s free note taker templates here.\n5. Virtual Questions\nIf you\u2019ve been searching for a platform for online discussion boards, the answer might be right in front of you: Google Classroom. While Classroom does not have a specific \u201cdiscussion board\u201d feature, Abby from Write on With Miss G has found a way to \u201chack\u201d Google Classroom questions so they function as discussion boards.\nHow it works:", "It\u2019s no surprise that kids love novelty, so when Staci from @theengagingstation handed her students these super fun, bright, and bubbly team packs, they were instantly intrigued.\nHow it works:\nIn face-to-face instruction, these team packs are a great way to foster collaborative discussion. Simply print one question on a piece of paper and insert it into a team pack. Students will work together to answer the question, then pack up their team pack and pass it on to the next group. When the next group receives it, they must add to the discussion answers by adding more analysis, text evidence, conclusions, and more.\nHow can this work digitally? Staci has found great success so far in the digital school year of using props. You can simply hold one of these fancy team packs on your camera display and pull out a question, or you could consider creating a Google Slide template that students can interactively click on to \u201copen\u201d the team pack (and it\u2019ll take them to a slide with a question!).", "Each of these silent discussion tech tools provides an avenue for students at home to be engaging with students at school. And, when all students are in the classroom together, they provide intentional avenues to give each student ownership and a voice in the discussion.\n2. Color-Coded Conversations\nWhether teaching ELA remotely or in person, Ashley Bible of Building Book Love makes it a point to provide ample opportunity for shy students to thrive. One of her go-to silent discussion strategies is a Color-Coded Conversation using a shared document.\nHow it works:\n- Set up a shared doc with a table that will fit all of your students plus the topics you want them to discuss. For example, a 4\u00d730 table if you have 30 students and want to discuss three points.\n- Instruct students to choose a UNIQUE color, font, or combo for their name. This specific color/font will follow them throughout the discussion.", "Consider\u2026students with devices where the microphones may or may not work? Noisy distractions in the home environment? Students tuning in live from home with other students sitting in the classroom?\nSilent discussions can bridge the gap.\nHow it works:\nIn order to make a virtual or blended learning silent discussion work, we first have to select the technology we need. In person, teachers often use big paper or graffiti walls. So, I started brainstorming how those engaging techniques can transfer to online learning.\nA few options\u2026\nWith Mentimeter, teachers can create a variety of poll questions to engage students in a variety of settings. You can create your interactive questions in different formats: word clouds, rankings, spider webs, bar charts, quadrants, word walls, and more. Teachers can create three-slide presentations for free. Students have easy access on any device by navigating to menti.com and then typing in the code at the top of the page.", "No matter the platform or design, what makes socratic seminars so powerful, is that the students are the only ones doing the talking, the answering, and the leading. The teacher\u2019s job is to sit at the periphery of the room, take anecdotal notes, and listen for the conversation to naturally build and deepen in complexity as it carries on.\nSocratic seminars take practice, but Amanda promises that the more often her class does them, the better they get every time! If you need inspiration for your questions and texts, Amanda has you covered!\n12. Fishbowl Discussions\nOne way that Christina, The Daring English Teacher, loves to get students engaged in meaningful classroom conversations is through fishbowl discussions. She holds fishbowl discussions every semester to provide students with an opportunity to discuss what they\u2019ve learned during the semester.\nHow it works:", "To set up a fishbowl discussion, she places two tables facing each other in the center of the classroom and then rearranges all of the other tables in a big circle around the two tables. Essentially, she creates a fishbowl.\nStudents then volunteer to go into the center of the fishbowl to answer the discussion questions. It is good to have four students enter the fishbowl at a time so that they can discuss each question and engage in a back-and-forth conversation as they answer the question.\nTo tie the discussion back to classroom content, The Daring English Teacher makes sure that the students not only answer the question, but they must also provide examples or evidence. This way, students can build off of one another with multiple examples to answer one question.\nWhy it works:", "Like a fishbowl discussion, students rotate in and out of the panel positions throughout the discussion so everyone gets a turn as a speaker and a listener. (Students rotate out of the panel when they\u2019ve fulfilled the speaking and listening requirements.)\nTo add another layer of complexity, the audience can partake in a virtual discussion to mimic \u201ctweeting,\u201d which often happens during panel discussion. Jenna uses a shared Google Doc or Backchannel Chat for her audience members.\nWhy it works:\nAll students are involved in the discussion. The variety of three different roles keeps things fresh. Teachers can be involved as little or as much as necessary, and throughout the year, they can scaffold panel discussions to full, student-led conversations.\nTo learn more about the steps for making students the experts in panel discussions, you can read more here.\n10. Team Packs", "Padlet is another tech platform teachers can use to hold silent discussions. Students can synchronously or asynchronously post original ideas in response to discussion questions in grid, timeline, map, wall, column, and other arrangements. One of the best parts is that students can post links to related articles or videos and original photographs they\u2019ve taken. Plus, they can build on their peer\u2019s posts to create an ongoing conversation.\nFinally, Backchannel chat is a convenient, free chat-style tool. While students are having a discussion either in person or online, non-verbal participants can be talking via the backchannel chat. I recommend \u2013 if possible \u2013 having two screens so that you can view students\u2019 faces on one (if you have students at home) and the backchannel chat on another.\nWhy it works:", "12 Powerful Discussion Strategies to Engage Students\nInside: Looking for collaborative class discussion strategies that work across settings? This post is full of a variety of engaging technology and formatting options for blended learning, online teaching, and face-to-face instruction.\nWhether you have students at home, in school, or BOTH at the same time, you\u2019re probably looking for ways to engage tweens and teens in meaningful conversations. Discussion strategies are changing. With the demands of social distancing and multiple settings, teachers are getting creative, looking for ways to bring students together, even when we are apart.", "Primarily, she uses Google Forms to organize students into groups; students answer one or two questions based on classroom studies. After you pose a question in the Form, decide how you\u2019d like students to answer. You can choose a multiple choice, short answer, or longer essay option.\nLauralee typically provides multiple choice options. Then when students respond, she separates students into groups based on their similar ideas. Often, Lauralee creates a Google Slides presentation for each group that is labeled after the multiple choice responses.\nWhy it works:\nStudents can then collaborate in a virtual setting, and they already are familiar with the topic since they answered the question similarly. Google Forms are quick to make, and the data is simple to process (especially with the multiple choice and checkbox features), which makes it a time-saving tool.\nCLASS DISCUSSION STRATEGIES: FORMATS", "While this strategy works well for fully virtual learning, it\u2019s also a great option for traditional, flipped, or hybrid learning. You can start class with a silent, virtual discussion board, and then use students\u2019 responses as a springboard for an in-class discussion. Or, you can assign a discussion board after a chapter of reading homework and let students learn from each other before you fill in the gaps during a whole-class discussion the following day.\nThese online discussion boards are powerful because they give all learners a voice in a low-risk setting. You can read more about how Abby structures and facilitates these online discussions HERE.\n6. Google Form Groupings\nGoogle Forms are such a simple and easy tool for teachers and students alike.\nIf you have not created Google Forms before, Lauralee walks you through the process in her digital classroom blog post.\nHow it works:", "Once you have your question written, you\u2019ll need to find texts that all speak to the question, and the more variety, the better! A novel study, art, TED Talks, poetry, and nonfiction are all texts that students can read and interpret ahead of time and then bring into the seminar discussion when it\u2019s time.\nOnce students are prepared with the EQ, any smaller sub questions, and the texts, it\u2019s time to invite them into the discussion.\nFace-to-Face: To host a socratic seminar in the classroom, arrange desks in a circle and discussion begins (this Teaching Channel video is an amazing starting place!).\nVirtual: Amanda has also hosted her socratic seminars using Google Docs and the platform Parlay with great success.\nWhy it works:", "Beyond traditional multiple choice, the Human Bar Graph is also a great survey tool. Give students a statement and have them rank how much they agree or disagree (A = strongly agree; D = strongly disagree). Use the answer choices to share opinions about a text or topic. For example, A could represent The character survived because of luck. B could represent The character survived because of his own perseverance, etc.\nYour students will love interacting in real time, and the discussions that follow will be rich!\n4. Collaborative Note Catchers\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to facilitate and keep track of small group discussions, Shana Ramin from Hello, Teacher Lady recommends using Google Slides as a collaborative note catcher.\nHow it works:", "Teachers can leverage this activity virtually using the same tactics, and leveraging breakout rooms, Google hangouts, or a similar tool for students to interact with one another.\nWhy it works:\nOne of the most inviting elements of a gallery walk is how it engages various learning styles and promotes independence. It\u2019s a simple activity with tremendous outcomes for students. Tanesha has found that it works for her shy and outgoing students!\n9. Panel Discussions\nInspired by a popular political show, Jenna (@drjennacopper) developed panel discussions as one of he favorite classroom discussion strategies. A panel discussion is made up of three roles: a moderator who asks questions (a student or the teacher), panelists (four to five students), and the audience (the rest of the class).\nHow it works:\nThe moderator guides the discussion, and the panelists function as \u201cexperts\u201d on the topics for discussion.", "- Have students give their points in their own boxes then move to other boxes to continue the conversation.\nWhy it works:\nStudents LOVE getting to choose their own font and colors while experiencing the novelty of multiple people typing on the same doc. Teachers benefit by being able to quickly scan and follow the color-coded contributors!

The pivot topic sentence introduces the paragraph\u2019s second main idea or contradicting point of view, also followed by one or two sentences of support.\nDifferent types of essays use topic sentences differently as well. Argumentative essays and persuasive essays may have more opinionated topic sentences, whereas those in expository essays would stick to facts. Compare-and-contrast essays, which alternate between opposite sides of a topic, rely on topic sentences to ease those transitions, on top of everything else.", "Similar to purely transitional sentences, pivot sentences are embedded within a paragraph\u2014not at the beginning\u2014to indicate a shift from one topic to another. They often include conjunctive adverbs such as however, meanwhile, furthermore, etc.\nBy contrast, Nikola Tesla saw alternating current as a better solution.\nHowever, the Bears\u2019 winning streak could not last forever.\nHow to write a good topic sentence\nTopic sentences follow many of the usual guidelines for writing sentences, but there are a few particular tips just for them.\n1 Get the reader interested with a hook\nGood topic sentences usually include a \u201chook,\u201d or something that makes people want to read more. While some are more common than others, you can hook your readers in a variety of ways:\n- Shocking revelations, like surprising facts or impressive data\nDespite the record-breaking turnouts, only one percent of the teams managed to complete the first challenge.", "The remaining paragraph is full of specific details about the apartment, but Daum doesn\u2019t mention them in the opening sentence. Likewise, she doesn\u2019t ignore the description altogether, giving a glimpse to the reader to pique their curiosity and prepare them for a paragraph describing the place.\n3 Be clear above all\nThe most important part of topic sentences is clarity. Even if you get the reader excited and eager to read more, it won\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re reading about.\nThis may be easy enough when just writing a single topic sentence, but it gets harder when writing sentence after sentence for hours on end. After a while, you get bogged down by your own thoughts and concerns about the essay and may momentarily forget about the reader\u2019s perspective.\nIf that writing process sounds familiar, try Grammarly. Our product not only catches typos and grammar mistakes, but also points out mismatched tone, weak word choice, and even assesses clarity.", "You have enough things to worry about when writing an essay; don\u2019t let the high-priority concerns like clarity fall through the cracks. Try Grammarly for free to see for yourself.", "If you have a complicated topic that covers multiple ideas, you may want to use a complex topic sentence. Even though these would still qualify as \u201cstatements,\u201d they address more than one main idea.\nAlthough the majority of people still believe in alpha wolf theory, the truth is that wolf packs in nature don\u2019t necessarily have a designated leader.\nAs appealing as Ayn Rand\u2019s ideas may seem to some, the logical and evidential support just isn\u2019t there.\nPurely transitional\nWhile all topic sentences have to deal with transitions to a degree, in some cases they can be purely transitional. These work best in circumstances when the topic changes drastically by drawing attention to the switch.\nHowever, not everyone agrees.\nThis was just the way the world was, and perhaps always would have been, if a random apple had not fallen onto the head of a young Isaac Newton.\nPivot", "This is the most basic type of topic sentence, in which the author makes a general statement that the rest of the paragraph elaborates on.\nNew research indicates a link between a person\u2019s cognitive style and the type of content they post on Twitter.\nThose weeks at the farmhouse gave me some of the best memories of my life.\nCommand\nTo break up the monotony of using the same sentence types over and over again, you can phrase your topic sentences as direct commands or requests to your readers.\nTake a look at the data to see what I mean.\nNow let\u2019s consider the alternative.\nQuestion (interrogative)\nOpening a paragraph with a question is a great way to get the reader interested and involved, as long as you stay on topic.\nWhat would you do if you became a millionaire overnight?\nHow many countries are prepared for a change in sea levels?\nComplex", "- Mystery, which is especially useful with interrogative topic sentences\nWhat finally changed the senator\u2019s mind?\n- Emotion, or encouraging the reader to form a personal connection with the topic\nLiving with a dog has its difficulties, but not as many as living without one.\n2 Find a middle ground between general and specific\nOne of the biggest challenges in writing topic sentences is learning how much to include and how much to save for the rest of the paragraph. In short, you want to say just enough so that the reader knows what the paragraph is about, and ideally gets interested. Everything else should wait until the supporting sentences.\nFor example, let\u2019s look at a topic sentence for a paragraph about an apartment, from Meghan Daum\u2019s essay \u201cMy Misspent Youth\u201d:\nThere was nothing particularly fancy about the place.", "This is true not just for different essay types, but also different paragraph types as well. Even within the same essay, the author may switch up paragraph styles between expository, descriptive, persuasive, and narrative\u2014in that case, each requires a slightly different style of topic sentence.\nTopic sentence vs. thesis statement\nIf you\u2019re also learning about how to write a thesis paper, you may get topic sentences confused with thesis statements. Basically, topic sentences introduce the main idea of a paragraph, whereas thesis statements introduce the main idea of the entire paper or essay. Both serve the same function\u2014preparing the reader with a preview\u2014but in different capacities.\nTopic sentence types and examples\nBefore you learn how to write a topic sentence, it helps to see what different forms they can take. Here we explain the different types, along with some topic sentence examples.\nSimple statement"], "title": "Topic Sentences: How Do You Write a Great One? - Grammarly"}, "https://edpsych.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/chapter/cultural-differences/": {"url": "https://edpsych.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/chapter/cultural-differences/", "description": "Cultural Differences in the Classroom", "snippets": ["Although monolingual speakers often do not realize it, the majority of children around the world are bilingual, meaning that they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Scotton, 2005). Even in the United States, which is a relatively monolingual society, more than 47 million people speak a language other than English at home, and about 10 million of these people were children or youths in public schools (United States Department of Commerce, 2003). The large majority of bilingual students (75 percent) are Hispanic, but the rest represent more than a hundred different language groups from around the world. In larger communities throughout the United States, it is therefore common for a single classroom to contain students from several language backgrounds at once.", ". IRE conversations may often work best when talking with a student privately, or when confirming knowledge that the student is likely to be able to display competently already, or when \u201cchoral\u201d speaking (responding together in unison) is appropriate.", "Culture is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people. Although sometimes the term is also used to refer specifically to the artistic, intellectual, and other \u201chigh-brow\u201d aspects of life, I use it here more broadly to refer to everything that characterizes a way of life\u2014baseball games as well as symphony concerts, and McDonald\u2019s as well as expensive restaurants. In this broad sense, culture is nearly synonymous with ethnicity, which refers to the common language, history, and future experienced by a group within society. Culture has elements that are obvious, like unique holidays or customs, but also features that are subtle or easy for outsiders to overlook, like beliefs about the nature of intelligence or about the proper way to tell a story. When a classroom draws students from many cultures or ethnic groups, therefore, the students bring to it considerable diversity", "Language Loss\nWhat about the other kind of imbalance, in which a student is acquiring English but losing ability with the student\u2019s home or heritage language? This sort of bilingualism is quite common in the United States and other nations with immigrant populations (Tse, 2001). Imagine this situation: First-generation immigrants arrive, and they soon learn just enough English to manage their work and daily needs but continue using their original language at home with family and friends from their former country. Their children, however, experience strong expectations and pressure to learn and use English, and this circumstance dilutes the children\u2019s experience with the heritage language. By the time the children become adults, they are likely to speak and write English better than their heritage language, and may even be unable or unwilling to use the heritage language with their own children (the grandchildren of the original immigrants).", "Note that in the early years of schooling, language loss can be minimized to some extent by the additive or parallel-track bilingual programs that I mentioned above. For a few years, though not forever, young students are encouraged to use both of their languages. In high school, in addition, some conventional foreign language classes\u2014 notably in Spanish\u2014can be adjusted to include and support students who are already native speakers of the language alongside students who are learning it for the first time (Tse, 2001). But for heritage languages not normally offered as \u201cforeign\u201d languages in school, of course, this approach will not work. Such languages are especially at risk of being lost.\nCultural Differences in Language Use", ". Teachers need to understand that diversity\u2014understand how students\u2019 habitual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors differ from each other, and especially how they differ from the teacher\u2019s.", "The student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you might suspect and as research has confirmed, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position than usual to express concepts or ideas in more than one way, and to be aware of doing so (Jimenez, et al. 1995; Francis, 2006). The question: \u201cWhat if a dog were called a cat?\u201d is less likely to confuse even a very young bilingual child. Nor will the follow-up question: \u201cCould the \u2018cat\u2019 meow?\u201d confuse them. Such skill in reflecting on language is a form of metacognition, which is defined as using language as an object of thought. Metacognition can be helpful for a variety of academic purposes, such as writing stories and essays, or interpreting complex text materials.\nUnbalanced Bilingualism", "There can be consequences of the difference in how the students respond to school. Here are some of the possibilities\u2014though keep in mind that there are also differences among students as individuals, whatever their background. The following are tendencies, not simple predictions:", "Oppositional Cultural Identity", ". Generally, though also more indirectly, minimizing language loss helps all bilingual students\u2019 education because preservation tends to enrich students\u2019 and parents\u2019 ability to communicate with each other. With two languages to work with, parents can stay \u201cin the loop\u201d better about their children\u2019s educations and support the teacher\u2019s work\u2014for example, by assisting more effectively with homework (Ebert, 2005).", "Cultures and ethnic groups differ not only in languages but also in how languages are used. Since some of the patterns differ from those typical of modern classrooms, they can create misunderstandings between teachers and students (Cazden, 2001; Rogers, et al., 2005). Consider these examples: In some cultures, it is considered polite or even intelligent not to speak unless you have something truly important to say. \u201cChitchat,\u201d or talk that simply affirms a personal tie between people, is considered immature or intrusive (Minami, 2002). In a classroom, this habit can make it easier for a child to learn not to interrupt others, but it can also make the child seem unfriendly.", "This situation might not at first seem like a problem for which we, as teachers, need to take responsibility, since the children immigrants, as students, are acquiring the dominant language of instruction. In fact, however, things are not that simple. Research finds that language loss limits students\u2019 ability to learn English as well or as quickly as they otherwise can. Having a large vocabulary in a first language, for example, has been shown to save time in learning vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda & McKinney, 2002). But students can only realize the savings if their first language is preserved. Preserving the first language is also important if a student has impaired skills in all languages and therefore needs intervention or help from a speech-language specialist. Research has found, in such cases, that the specialist can be more effective if the specialist speaks and uses the first language as well as English (Kohnert, et al., 2005)", "In some cases, dominant cultural attitudes can oppress or alienate particular students to the point where they feel they have no choice but to put themselves on the margins of mainstream activity. Such students may develop an oppositional cultural identity, meaning that they define themselves not by who they are, but by how they differ from or oppose mainstream culture (Ogbu & Davis, 2003; Carter, 2005). Instead of aspiring to do well in school, for example, or to get along well with teachers, the students may aspire not to do well and not to be liked by teachers. Obviously, this sort of attitude poses problems for teachers who try to motivate the students, it also poses problems for the student\u2019s long-term success in life. Oppositional identity is especially likely in so-called involuntary minorities\u2014groups that emigrated to or joined a society against their will and who may have been given few resources with which to participate in society", "Yet many non-white cultures tend to believe in something closer to an interdependent self, or a belief that it is relationships and responsibilities, and not uniqueness and autonomy, that defines a person (Greenfield, 1994; Greenfield, et al., 2003). From this perspective, the most worthy person is not the one who is unusual or who stands out in a crowd. Such a person might actually be regarded as lonely or isolated. The worthy person is instead the one who gets along well with family and friends, and who meets obligations to them reliably and skillfully. At some level, of course, we all value interpersonal skill and to this extent think of ourselves as interdependent. And individuals within any given society will vary in their attitudes about personal identity", "- In most non-Anglo cultures, questions are intended to gain information, and it is assumed that a person asking the question truly does not have the information requested (Rogoff, 2003). In most classrooms, however, teachers regularly ask test questions, which are questions to which the teacher already knows the answer and that simply assess whether a student knows the answer as well (Macbeth, 2003). The question: \u201cHow much is 2 + 2?\u201d for example, is a test question. If the student is not aware of this purpose, he or she may become confused, or think that the teacher is surprisingly ignorant! Worse yet, the student may feel that the teacher is trying deliberately to shame the student by revealing the student\u2019s ignorance or incompetence to others.\nCultural Differences in Attitudes and Beliefs", "But this kind of understanding can get complicated. To organize the topic, therefore, I will discuss aspects of cultural diversity according to how directly they relate to language differences compared to differences in other social and psychological features of culture. The distinction is convenient, but it is also a bit arbitrary because, as you will see, the features of a culture overlap and influence each other.\nBilingualism: Language Differences in the Classroom", ". But it also includes subtleties, like starting and finishing tasks when the teacher tells students to do so, or answering a question promptly at the time it is asked rather than sometime later when the discussion has already moved on. Oppositional cultural identity", "- Eye contact varies by culture. In many African American and Latin American communities, it is considered appropriate and respectful for a child not to look directly at an adult who is speaking to them (Torres-Guzman, 1998). In classrooms, however, teachers often expect a lot of eye contact (as in \u201cI want all eyes on me!\u201d) and may be tempted to construe a lack of eye contact as a sign of indifference or disrespect.\n- Social distance varies by culture. In some cultures, it is common to stand relatively close when having a conversation; in others, it is more customary to stand relatively far apart (Beaulieu, 2004). Problems may happen when a teacher and student prefer different social distances. A student who expects a closer distance than does the teacher may seem overly familiar or intrusive, whereas one who expects a longer distance may seem overly formal or hesitant.", "Unfortunately, the bilingualism of many students is \u201cunbalanced\u201d in the sense that they are either still learning English, or else they have lost some earlier ability to use their original, heritage language\u2014or occasionally a bit of both. The first sort of student\u2014sometimes called an English language learner (ELL) or limited English learner (LEL)\u2014has received the greatest attention and concern from educators, since English is the dominant language of instruction and skill and obviously helps prepare a student for life in American society. ELL students essentially present teachers with this dilemma: how to respect the original language and culture of the student while also helping the student to join more fully in the mainstream\u2014i.e", "James Banks has proposed five features of a fully multicultural educational program (2009). The first two of these were mentioned in the paragraph above, but not the next three:\n- Integrating cultural content into the curriculum wherever possible.\n- Stimulating knowledge construction to help students understand cultural assumptions.\n- Flexible teaching strategies that give all students access and success with learning. If some students prefer to learn cooperatively rather than independently, for example, then teachers should make provisions for cooperative learning activities.", "- Interpersonal time versus clock time: In order to function, all schools rely on fairly precise units of time as measured on clocks. Teachers typically allot a fixed number of minutes to one lesson or class, another fixed number of minutes for the next, another for recess or lunchtime, and so on. In more ways than one, therefore, being on time becomes especially valued in schools, as it is in many parts of society. Punctuality is not always conducive, however, to strong personal relationships, which develop best when individuals do not end joint activities unilaterally or arbitrarily but allow activities to \u201cfinish themselves,\u201d so to speak\u2014to finish naturally. If personal relationships are a broad, important priority for a student, therefore, it may take effort and practice by the student to learn the extent to which schools and teachers expect punctuality. Punctuality includes the obvious, like showing up for school when school is actually scheduled to begin", "In classrooms as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees. At one extreme are students who speak both English and another language fluently; at the other extreme are those who speak only limited versions of both languages. In between are students who speak their home (or heritage) language much better than English, as well as others who have partially lost their heritage language in the process of learning English (Tse, 2001). Commonly, too, a student may speak a language satisfactorily but be challenged by reading or writing it\u2014though even this pattern has individual exceptions. Whatever the case, each bilingual student poses unique challenges to teachers.\nBalanced or Fluent Bilingualism", "- Avoidance of standing out publicly: Even when we, as teachers, avoid obvious forms of competition, we may still interact frequently with students one at a time while allowing or inviting many others to observe the conversation. An especially common pattern for such conversations is sometimes called the IRE cycle, an abbreviation for the teacher initiating, a student responding, and the teacher then evaluating the response (Mehan, 1979). What is sometimes taken for granted is how often IRE cycles are witnessed publicly, and how much the publicity can be stressful or embarrassing for students who do not value standing out in a group but who do value belonging to the group. The embarrassment can be especially acute if they feel unsure about whether they have the correct knowledge or skill to display. To keep such students from \u201cclamming up\u201d completely, therefore, teachers should consider limiting IRE cycles to times when they are truly productive", "Of all of these strategies, the most important is the third: being flexible about the choice of teaching strategies. By allowing for various styles of learning, teachers can accommodate a wide range of students, whatever their cultural backgrounds and whatever cultural background the teacher herself may have. And flexibility has an added advantage: honoring students\u2019 individuality, it avoids the danger of stereotyping students\u2019 learning needs on the basis of their cultural background.\nCandela Citations\nCC licensed content, Shared previously\n- Educational Psychology.

English-speaking\u2014culture? Programs to address this question have ranged from total immersion in English from a young age (the \u201csink or swim\u201d approach) to phasing in English over a period of several years (sometimes called an additive approach to bilingual education). In general, evaluations of bilingual programs have favored the more additive approaches (Beykont, 2002). Both languages are developed and supported, and students ideally become able to use either language permanently, though often for different situations or purposes. A student may end up using English in the classroom or at work, for example, but continue using Spanish at home or with friends, even though he or she is perfectly capable of speaking English with them.", "In addition to differences in language and in practices related to language, cultural groups tend to differ in various other attitudes and beliefs. Complete descriptions of the details of the differences have filled entire books and encyclopedias (see, for example, Birx, 2005). For teachers, however, one of the most important differences centers on personal beliefs about identity\u2014the sense of self or of \u201cwho you are.\u201d A number of other cultural beliefs and practices can be understood as resulting from how members of a culture think about personal identity.", "- Wait time varies by culture. Wait time is the gap between the end of one person\u2019s comment or question and the next person\u2019s reply or answer. In some cultures, the wait time is relatively long\u2014as long as three or four seconds (Tharp & Gallimore, 1989). In others it is a \u201cnegative\u201d gap, meaning that it is acceptable, even expected, for a person to interrupt before the end of the previous comment. In classrooms the wait time is customarily about one second; after that, the teacher is likely to move on to another question or to another student. A student who habitually expects a wait time longer than one second may seem hesitant, and not be given many chances to speak. A student who expects a \u201cnegative\u201d wait time, on the other hand, may seem overeager or even rude.", "In white, middle-class American culture, the self tends to be thought of as unique and independent\u2014a unitary, living source of decisions, choices, and actions that stands (or should eventually stand) by itself (Greenfield, et al., 2003; Rogoff, 2003). This view of the self is assumed by educators, for example, when students are expected to take responsibility for their own successes or failures, or when students are evaluated individually rather than as a group or team. As teachers, most of us subscribe to the idea that all students are unique and therefore take steps to individualize or differentiate instruction. Across a variety of circumstances, teachers tend to believe in an independent self.", "Cultural Differences in the Classroom", ". The cultural difference between individual and interdependent self is one of average tendency or emphasis, with many non-white cultures emphasizing interdependence significantly more than white middle-class society does, on average, and more than many schools in particular.", "- Encourage prejudice reduction among all students. This can and should happen even in classes that do not seem culturally diverse on the surface. Such classes always have diversity, even if it is not visible immediately: students\u2019 families will vary in their financial circumstances, students themselves will vary in their gender preferences, and students will vary in their attitudes about religion, politics, and many other issues.\n- Encourage the entire school to be aware of cultural diversity and its effects. What is the racial composition of the school staff? What are their attitudes? What school policies favor particular students unfairly?", ". What sort of sharing or helping with answers, the student may ask, is truly legitimate? If the teacher answers this question more narrowly than does the student, then what the student views as cooperative sharing may be seen by the teacher as laziness, \u201cfreeloading,\u201d or even cheating.", "Accommodating Cultural Diversity in Practice\nAs the comments in the previous section imply, accommodating cultural diversity involves more than adding cultural content to the curriculum\u2014more than celebrating Mexican holidays in an American social studies class, for example, and more than discussing the history of slavery of African-Americans. These are useful actions, but they are only a starting point for truly multicultural education (Banks, 2009). In addition, it is important to engage students in exploring the culturally-based assumptions of whatever subject they are studying. In studying the \u201cWestward Movement\u201d (the settlement of the American West), for example, it is important to point out that this movement was \u201cwestward\u201d only from the point of view of the white Americans living in the eastern United States. To the indigenous American Indians, the \u201cwest\u201d was the center of their world; to the Mexicans, it was \u201cnorth\u201d; to the Asian laborers living in California, it was \u201ceast.\u201d", "- Preference for activities that are cooperative rather than competitive: Many activities in school are competitive, even when teachers try to de-emphasize the competition. Once past the first year or second year of school, students often become attentive to who receives the highest marks on an assignment, for example, or who is the best athlete at various sports or whose contributions to class discussion the most verbal recognition from the teacher (Johnson & Johnson, 1998). Suppose, in addition, that a teacher deliberately organizes important activities or assignments competitively (as in \u201cLet\u2019s see who finishes the math sheet first.\u201d). Classroom life can then become explicitly competitive, and the competitive atmosphere can interfere with cultivating supportive relationships among students or between students and the teacher (Cohen, 2004). For students who give priority to these relationships, competition can seem confusing at best and threatening at worst", ". In the United States, for example, African-Americans and American Indians may have been involuntary minorities originally, although many present-day individuals from these groups may now feel very much a part of American culture. As cultural groups, however, their experiences have been quite different than so-called voluntary minorities\u2014groups that chose to emigrate to society in order to create better lives for themselves. The latter groups are more likely to work actively to fit into their newfound culture. Learning to fit into a new culture is a challenging task itself, but on the whole, it is an easier task for teachers to work with than oppositional motivation."], "title": "Cultural Differences in the Classroom \u2013 Educational Psychology"}, "https://helpfulprofessor.com/cultural-differences-examples/": {"url": "https://helpfulprofessor.com/cultural-differences-examples/", "description": "15 Cultural Differences Examples (2024)", "snippets": ["It is, therefore, necessary to decide who lives where.

These account for around 85% of the cases social scientists know about, but patrilocal residence is far more common among cultures.\n2.

Go to Spain, for example, and learn all about very late dinners!\n- Educational methods \u2013 In 21st Century Western nations, we are accustomed to formal education in classrooms and standardized testing. But go to Indigenous Australian communities, and we can see that they have their own learning styles heavily reliant on story sharing, symbolism, and non-verbal cues.\nThought Bubble: Are We Really All That Different?\nSome anthropologists and biologists have argued against the empirical assumption that cultures are as variable as we might think.\nThese anthropologists argue that there are cultural universals \u2013 concepts that unite all cultures.", "Kinship, mourning, birth, the experience of empathy and sympathy, fear, concepts of luck, the use of grammar, exchange, cooperation, competition, aggression, reciprocity, and the biological needs, are some of the constant elements of human experience that go against the assumption that world cultures are fundamentally different (Brown 2004).\nCommon Categories of Cultural Difference\n1. Kinship\nUnlike many other mammals, human adults rarely live alone. Families are the basic building blocks of any society.\nHow big these families are and how they are composed varies significantly between cultures.\nConsider this example: you are a parent worried about your children no longer living with you when you\u2019re too old for productive work. Some children will grow up and get married. Once they\u2019re married, some children will have to stop living with their parents.", "There are, however, significant cultural differences regarding community exogamy/endogamy, cousin marriage, arranged marriage, polygyny/polyandry, and so on (Ember, 2021).\nLet\u2019s take the example of community exogamy and endogamy. Community exogamy refers to marriage with a spouse from another community. Endogamy refers to marriage within the community.\nThe most common rule is to allow marriage both within and outside of the community, as it is accepted in, for example, European countries. Community exogamy occurs in around 33% of the world\u2019s societies, while endogamy occurs in 7.5% (Kirby et al., 2016).\nAnother example of cultural variation can be observed in rules concerning the toleration of cousin marriage. Some societies, like the Selk\u2019nam of Tierra del Fuego, are averse to marriage between related people (Gusinde, 1931). Others, like the Komachi of southern Iran, prefer being married to their kin (Bradburd, 1990, p. 115).\n3. Art", "- Celebrations \u2013 Cultural celebrations in different cultures include New Years Eve, Chinese new year, birthdays, and Diwali.\n- Cultural taboos \u2013 While there are some universal taboos, you\u2019ll also notice that some cultures consider certain things you consider \u2018normal\u2019 to be very much taboo! For example, some cultures encourage eye contact while other cultures find it offensive.\n- Rites of passage \u2013 Rites of passage can include the walkabout in Indigenous Australian culture, baptisms in Christianity, school graduation ceremonies, and so forth.\n- Worldviews \u2013 In broad strokes, Western nations like the modern United States have had a strong history of individualism, while Indigenous cultures often embrace communalism and stewardship of nature.\n- Dress codes \u2013 When you travel the world, you quickly learn that some cultures encourage conservative dress, such as covering your shoulders and knees in public.", "Examples of cultural differences include differences in values, norms, beliefs, mores, rituals, mannerisms, and expressions between different societies.\nWe can also identify cultural differences in eating and drinking habits, religious beliefs, moral beliefs, rituals, time management, sanitation, greeting, gift giving, exchange, conformity, rebelliousness, sports, language, work ethic, marriage, and so on can all be cultural.\nIt is common to apply Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions theory to analyze different dimensions of cultures (Hofstede, 2011).\nCultural Differences Examples\n- Kinship \u2013 Kinship principles generally form the basis of societal organization. Families consisting of at least one parent and one child are customary in all societies, but there are many differences beyond this.\n- Marriage \u2013 Marriage and families seem to be human universals, but there is significant variability in customs related to these aspects of social life.", "Lenard, P.

Religion\nReligious beliefs and practices vary significantly from culture to culture and change over time.\nDifferent societies have different gods, spirits, types of rituals, and supernatural forces.\nReligion itself appears to be common across many cultures, but the specifics are not.

And yet\u2026\nI spent a lot of time this week reading research on context and meaning. For the most part, I was disappointed.\nMy take? The research community has been spinning its wheels. Most of their questions have been decidedly academic (in this context, academic means useless for any practical purpose).\nOlder research usefully revealed that poor readers were not efficient or proficient in deriving meaning from context (McKeown, 1985). Studies also showed that students gain a lot of word meanings just by reading and using context (Nagy, Anderson, & Herman, 1987).", "I\u2019m writing this blog because of the disarray I see over the topic of context instruction and the poor instructional practice that it seems to manifest.\nOne confusion is already well recognized, but merits some mention here. The other befuddlement usually goes without remark, and yet it, too, has unfortunate consequences for young readers.\nLet\u2019s dispatch the first problem forthwith. This one I\u2019ll refer to as the three-cueing problem. Research found that when students err in reading a word, they often try to use various kinds of information to resolve the difficulty. Essentially, when something goes wrong, readers try to make things work one way or another. They don\u2019t try to read the word as much as to get it right anyway possible. They turn to context \u2013 trying to guess the word by the meaning of the other words, the pictures, the syntax. Whatever it takes.", "I don\u2019t recognize all those diseases.

Context use should improve the ability to answer questions about a text or to write a summary of it.", "The practical outcomes from such studies have largely been limited to the development of context-taxonomies with little practical value in real reading. Research continues to emphasize various types of context clues (e.g., definitions, antonyms, synonyms, comparison and contrast, examples, lists, cause and effect, inferences).\nI use context a lot in my reading, and never try to identify or classify the types of contexts that is available. I can\u2019t imagine that categorizing context clues would improve my reading.\nNevertheless, these schemes have attracted and continue to attract research. Their results \u2013 despite all logic \u2013 may even persuade some of their pedagogical value.", "Most context instruction emphasizes whether kids can arrive at the right definition of a word from sentence or paragraph context.

Rarely are the sentences in authentic texts written to, so obviously, reveal the meaning of a word.\nTeaching word meanings has a deserved place in the curriculum. Teaching context is something different from that. In the earlier example that I gave, the one with the word particle, I would prefer it if the student were trying to interpret the sentence rather than the word. Crumb might be a good synonym for particle in this case, but so would the word anything. Admittedly, anything is a lousy definition for particle, but such a response would show that the student had been able to interpret the author\u2019s meaning \u2013 even when they could not articulate a definition for particle.", "The real purpose of using context is to comprehend the text, not to learn word meanings. Context use also improves efficiency and reduces the burden of having to look up so many words. If we teach context use effectively, then reading comprehension, and perhaps, reading rate, should improve. Students may also end up knowing more words than they would without such teaching, but that would be a secondary outcome, not the primary one.\nContext instruction should be aimed at facilitating reading, rather than as a delivery system for explicit vocabulary teaching.\nWhen I confront an unknown word in text, I first determine whether it matters. imagine I come to the following sentence:\nThere are many serious diseases of the stomach and duodenum, including gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastroparesis, non-ulcer dyspepsia, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer.", "That fooled some authorities into encouraging the teaching of those solve-it-at-all-cost strategies, instead of teaching them to read. A bad idea, since poor readers are more likely to turn to semantics, pictures, and syntax to guess words, while better readers rely on the letters and sounds. Why teach kids to read like poor readers?\nContext does have a role in the decoding process, but as an evaluation check rather than a word reading tool. Meaning (or the lack of it) reveals the success of decoding. If decoding worked, the reader keeps rolling. In cases of failure, the reader must look at the word again to decide among the decoding alternatives (\u201cmaybe this is a schwa sound and not a long vowel?\u201d).

Efficient readers not only look at these \"outside\" context clues, but they combine this with \"inside the word\" clues -- i.e., use of morphology to recognize meaningful units within a word.

And, in preparation for the 1973 municipal elections, the party prepared a detailed spatial analysis of past Oakland voting patterns, exploring divisions between white and black neighborhoods on such issues as public housing and district versus at-large elections for city council, as well as about congressional and California Assembly candidates.", "The Panthers\u2019 critique began with the physical destruction of West Oakland and moved, in an ever widening arc, to encompass the principal contradictions of the East Bay economy as a whole. Using the publications of the Oakland Project, the University of California\u2019s multiyear study of Oakland, the results of the federal government\u2019s 701 housing survey, and various reports and research papers produced by the Survey Research Center (affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley), the Black Panther documented for its readers the systematic demolition and redevelopment of West Oakland. Here were the familiar culprits: BART, the new freeways and federal post office, the closing of public housing projects, massive delays on West Oakland\u2019s biggest new housing project, Acorn, and residential displacement", "More than anything else, the party seized upon the Port of Oakland as a symbol of the city\u2019s failed priorities and the deep contradictions within local economic development. \u201cWhile the Port thrives, Oakland stagnates,\u201d read the headline in a special edition of The Black Panther in 1972. \u201cIts spiraling growth, which began a few years ago, has not brought about the same kind of increase in employment for Black and poor people in Oakland.\u201d Indeed, the Port of Oakland had become the West Coast\u2019s busiest and largest, doubling its annual income between 1968 and 1972. According to the Panthers, though, \u201cthe city gets little in return: no jobs and no access to Port income at a time when Oakland city government flirts with bankruptcy.\u201d In fact, the party contended, \u201ctenants get special tax privileges to lower their property tax bills, and in some instances the Port actually pays their property taxes.\u201c The Panthers highlighted the odd independence of the Port", "The first thing to notice is that strung together, the topic sentences summarize the passage as a whole. If the whole article is written in this way, then a reader can zip through the piece by reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, choosing to read full paragraphs only when she wants to know more about the claim made in the topic sentence. Few if any books an articles are written entirely in this manner, but in most cases, one can get the gist of a paragraph by reading the first two sentences, or the first and last sentence. Aim for the same kind of summary.\n(Dr. Cynthia Schafer has a great term for this device: the \u201ctopic-sentence poem.\u201d)", ". Its Board of Commissioners was appointed by the mayor, but city hall had little other official control over Port activities and revenue. The Port remained a public entity, technically owned by the city, but its operations and revenue were virtually untouchable. As the Black Panther observed, this arrangement meant that when public tax dollars were invested in the port\u2014as had happened during its phenomenal growth\u2014 the proceeds redounded primarily to the benefit of private shipping companies, not the residents of Oakland. In all, the party argued, the Port\u2019s operation was another example of the city\u2019s \u201cbehind the scenes deals for millions of dollars, money that is never used to benefit us [Oakland citizens].\u201d", "For an example of topic sentences at work, see Robert Self\u2019s article, \u201c\u2019To Plan Our Liberation\u2019: Black Power and the Politics of Place in Oakland, California, 1965-1977,\u201d Journal of Urban History 26 (September 2000): 759-792, doi:10.1177/009614420002600603. (Since this is a page about topic sentences, not citation, I have deleted the footnote references.) Self\u2019s overall thesis is that \u201cblack power as a political phenomenon was not primarily a response to the civil rights movement but a parallel development that sought to redistribute economic and political power within the increasingly divided metropolis without emphasizing integration.\u201d In the following passage, Self offers evidence in the form of examples of actions by the Black Panther Party:", "May 2007. Minor revisions, December 2011, December 2019.\nA topic sentence\u2014usually the first sentence of a paragraph\u2014should fit evidence or analysis into a broader argument. To do so, it does three things.\n- A topic sentence holds facts together. When you have a series of facts on the same general subject, group them together and summarize them with a topic sentence.\n- A topic sentence relates facts to argument. In addition to summarizing the facts within a paragraph, it must show their relevance to your overall thesis. To do so, a topic sentence cannot merely state facts, but must make a claim about those facts, serving as the thesis statement of a one-paragraph essay.\n- A topic sentence relates the paragraph to what came before. It often will contain transition words showing continuity (next, another, more) or a turning point in the argument (despite, nevertheless, but).", ". \u201cBART has spent over 20 million dollars,\u201d the newspaper cited as an example, \u201chas literally dislocated thousands of people in West Oakland, offered few of the promised jobs to Blacks, and has the nerve to make one stop in West Oakland.\u201d The Black Pantherpublished special editions on the cost of living, public housing (exposing problems in the Oakland Housing Authority), imbalances in urban and suburban public school budgets, urban renewal, and unemployment. It was a remarkably coherent body of critical journalistic work, concluded after its first year, 1972, with a special issue titled \u201cOur Challenge for 1973.\u201d The latter became the political platform on which Bobby Seale and Elaine Brown ran for local office.", "Note in particular that Self\u2019s topic sentences do not include direct quotations; he saves those for the bodies of the paragraphs. Historians only rarely use quotations in their topic sentences, since the topic sentences should present the scholar\u2019s voice, not the sources\u2019.\nSelf presents each topic sentence in the active voice, with active verbs: began, moved, encompass, seized, and mixed\u2014not a was or were in the lot. And while two of the three sentences have abstract nouns (critique and campaign) as their subjects, they are connected closely enough to a group of people\u2014the Black Panthers\u2014that the reader has no doubt about whose story this is.", "Self is also careful about his use of transitions. The first sentence uses the verb \u201cbegan,\u201d signaling that he is moving to a new topic, or a new chapter in his story. The next one uses \u201cmore\u201d to hint that it is an elaboration on what just came before. That is, while the first paragraph discusses several places in the East Bay, the second one focuses on just one: the Port of Oakland. The third topic sentence\u2019s transitional word is \u201cmixed.\u201d Self tells us to keep in mind what we have just read, because he is about to mix in a new element.\nWithout these topic sentences, Self\u2019s careful research would be but a jumble of names and dates. With them, it becomes a powerful argument.", "The party\u2019s two-year campaign mixed its older anticolonial discourse with this new attention to local political and economic arrangements in Oakland. The Panthers linked the Port\u2019s growth, for instance, to the \u201cimperialist war\u201d in Vietnam, even likening Oakland to \u201cother colonial cities of Asia or Africa: Shanghai, Singapore, Alexandria, and Hong Kong\u201d because of the nearby army base and U.S. Naval Supply Center from which soldiers and materiel were shipped to Southeast Asia. Although the party\u2019s characterization of Oakland as a colonial outpost bordered on the fanciful and defined the outer limits of Panther discursive excesses, other \u201cBase of Operation\u201d critiques had more substantial merit. The party consistently emphasized the enormous percentage of the city\u2019s white workforce that lived outside of Oakland (more than 50 percent by some estimations), particularly the municipal police force and members of the fire department", "The topic sentences are as follows:\nThe Panthers\u2019 critique began with the physical destruction of West Oakland and moved, in an ever widening arc, to encompass the principal contradictions of the East Bay economy as a whole. More than anything else, the party seized upon the Port of Oakland as a symbol of the city\u2019s failed priorities and the deep contradictions within local economic development.

Similar to the above Nintendo timeline, it shows the vastly differing appearance of lifeforms from the start of the earth\u2019s history as we know it to the present day. It also draws attention to when mass extinction events occurred, as well as provide a short description of what was happening on earth during a given time period when different animals started to appear.\nYour takeaway: Again, showing the progression of your product or project can help emphasize how far you\u2019ve come, but if there were any events that contributed to or slowed down your progress, those might be important to note and call attention to, as well.\n11. Show where certain events might have slowed you down", "Your takeaway: You don\u2019t have to limit yourself to one project at a time. You can compare the effort your team made on various projects over time or take a look at how much different products were mentioned on social media and compare the two at once to convey where you should be putting your efforts.\n7. Let people customize your timeline\nThis interactive creative timeline example lets you play with different variables to quickly assess changes in diverse employment trends at major tech companies over time. The ability to quickly visualize changes year over year makes it easy to see advances and setbacks for minority populations in tech.\nYour takeaway: We can\u2019t all code interactive timelines, but the more you let readers or stakeholders customize the information they can see on your timeline, the more useful it can be. When people can customize their views, they\u2019re able to see what\u2019s important to them specifically.\n8. Show how the past has affected the present", "Did you know the creation of cheese was an impressive advancement of biotechnology? Me either, but thank heavens the Egyptians discovered it. I, for one, am forever grateful to this culinary science. This creative timeline example stretches thousands of years into the past and forward into the future to highlight important biotech advances (such as cheese), all on a multi-colored DNA double helix graphic.\nYour takeaway: Don\u2019t be afraid to predict things based on past and present events. You don\u2019t need to look back to ancient Egyptian times to do it, but looking at past progress can help set expectations and plans for the future.\n13. Simple (but powerful) comparisons will suffice", "This simple\u2014but still creative\u2014timeline example does one thing very well: it separates and conveys information through simple color coding and bold font. I could cut this timeline into different pieces and have a flashcard set of inventors and inventions who influenced the industrial revolution.\nYour takeaway: If you need to emphasize certain points in time, sometimes all it takes is a simple bold font or attention-grabbing color. You don\u2019t need to make all your information super flashy, but you should spend time making sure people see your most important points clearly.\n15. Use timelines even for short periods of time\nA good timeline can really spice up a simple agenda. This creative timeline example takes a wedding itinerary and adds a personal touch with simple graphics. Plus, there\u2019s the added bonus of literally being able to picture how the day will go: I know just from looking at this timeline that the day starts with preparation\u2014makeup, taking pictures\u2014and ends in a huge party.", "Your takeaway: Timelines don\u2019t have to focus on large events that happen over a long span of time. You can also break smaller time frames down to emphasize the important things that need to happen that you might not necessarily see with a birds\u2019 eye view of a project.\n16. Show how your work is connected to a larger purpose\nIn the middle of a sprint, it can be difficult to remember what you\u2019re working toward. You can get so caught up in your smaller tasks that you forget the larger project. This creative timeline example shows the phases of a project broken down into sprints, the purpose of each sprint, and how much progress is made at the end of each sprint.\nYour takeaway: Linking smaller project phases together to show how they connect to a finished product or your project as a whole can be helpful when reminding teammates why different sprints are individually important.\nConvey tons of information in the shortest amount of time", "- Depicting advancements in technology size and design style\n- Comparing sales figures to corresponding gaming systems so you can see the comparative popularity and lucrativeness of Nintendo\u2019s various gaming systems\nIf that\u2019s not an effective use of graphics and data, I don\u2019t know what is, folks.\nYour takeaway: You can use a timeline to compare past and present versions of your product to show how your team\u2019s work over the years has provided noticeable improvements (and connecting those improvements directly to sales figures wouldn\u2019t hurt, either).\n10. Provide chronological and historical context", "Ever wondered when someone thought Comic Sans was a good idea? Or what the origins of famous logo fonts were? Did you know the font used in the Harry Potter books was first created nearly 500 years ago??? Well, you can see all that at a glance by looking at this creative timeline example, which matches font origins to modern day literature and marketing.\nYour takeaway: You don\u2019t have to focus on right now. If your team worked on something years ago that\u2019s contributing to the success of a current project, be sure to emphasize that historic link so past efforts don\u2019t go unnoticed.

But if you want to know more, you can look at the wealth of information this timeline provides.", "The creative timeline examples in this piece were picked completely subjectively, based on nothing but my own personal taste. There was no academic process in selecting them, I just picked ones that made me say, \u201cOooh, that\u2019s nice!\u201d Hopefully, you\u2019ll find a creative timeline example or two in this post that you like, as well.\nIn some instances, I\u2019ve cropped these timelines.

It shows where various chapters are located and gives you a visual summary of what each chapter will be about.\nYour takeaway: A timeline doesn\u2019t have to be a huge deal. You can use one to convey a simple sequence or order of things at a glance.\n2. You don\u2019t need to get fancy", "Bear with me: this graphic is less of a creative timeline example and more of a comparison of time periods. However, I\u2019m highlighting this drug test infographic to show how a simple graphic comparison (different amounts of sand in side-by-side hourglasses) can quickly convey huge time differences. This infographic doesn\u2019t really contain much in-depth information\u2014nor does it need to\u2014because its images are so powerful and straightforward.\nYour takeaway: If you can compare things side-by-side in a simple graphic format, you don\u2019t need a lot of explanation for your stats and figures. If you\u2019ve got particularly powerful or compelling numbers to explain, try to depict them in a similarly straightforward way.\n14. Emphasize exactly what\u2019s important", "This post was updated in January, 2021, to include different creative timeline examples and tie them more directly to project timeline creation tips.\nI\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m a sucker for good visualizations. If a graphic conveys useful information quickly and looks good while doing it, sign me up. I\u2019ll share that bad boy all over the internet in no time.\nCreative timelines are one of my favorite examples of useful visualizations. Not only do they convey lots of information in a simple way, they also provide context for that information by displaying it sequentially along with other related events.\nTimelines can stretch far back in time or fast-forward into the future. They can show how events happened or are happening simultaneously. Some timelines are even designed in a way to show where things happened in time, giving you geographic contexts for various events.", "My point is, timelines are awesome. (Are you already convinced of the power of timelines and did you end up here in your search for a powerful Agile PPM tool to create timelines? I might have the answer for you\u2026)\nMy second point is, if you\u2019re looking to for a way to quickly convey when something will happen and how it fits into the bigger picture, a good timeline can go a long way.\nProject and program managers are acutely aware of this fact, which is why many rely on timelines to share basic project information\u2014milestones, due dates, ongoing tasks, all the important moving pieces\u2014with their teams.\nTo help you get just as excited about timelines as I am (good luck!) and start applying your organizational skills to project timelines, I found some creative timeline examples I love. Hopefully, these timelines will give you a good idea of graphics that convey lots of useful information while also grabbing their viewers\u2019 attention.\nCreative timeline examples you can draw inspiration from", "Regardless of your religious beliefs, this creative timeline example does a great job of showing Old Testament biblical figures in time by depicting which patriarchs\u2019 lifespans overlapped. You can also see how lifespans shortened dramatically (according to the Bible) sometime after the great biblical flood.\nYour takeaway: If you can show how different phases of your project\u2014or other teams\u2019 projects\u2014impacted your own or your portfolio as a whole, it can be helpful when describing a big picture. Including important events \u2014such as a biblical flood or worldwide economic recession, for example\u2014can also add context to the progression of your project.\n12. Use the past to justify future expectations", "Your takeaway: You can use a timeline to convey as little or as much information as you want.

Emphasize events that have made or will make the biggest impact\nThis creative timeline example depicts related events and the estimated impact of those events by using different sizes of bubbles along the timeline.\nYour takeaway: You can use different elements, such as the size of your graphics, to emphasize more important events over smaller ones throughout your timeline to show that not every event is created equal.\n6.

A recent study of human genomes in Papua New Guinea suggests that humans may have lived with and interbred with Denisovans there as recently as 15,000 years ago, though the claims are controversial. Their genetic legacy is more certain. Many living Asian people inherited perhaps 3 to 5 percent of their DNA from the Denisovans.\nDespite the bits of genetic ancestry they contributed to living people, all of our close relatives eventually died out, leaving Homo sapiens as the only human species. Their extinctions add one more intriguing, perhaps unanswerable question to the story of our evolution\u2014why were we the only humans to survive?", "Fossils often boast a mixture of modern and primitive features, and those don\u2019t evolve uniformly toward our modern anatomy. Instead, certain features seem to change in different places and times, suggesting separate clusters of anatomical evolution would have produced quite different looking people.\nNo scientists suggest that Homo sapiens first lived in what\u2019s now Morocco, because so much early evidence for our species has been found in both South Africa and East Africa. But fragments of 300,000-year-old skulls, jaws, teeth and other fossils found at Jebel Irhoud, a rich site also home to advanced stone tools, are the oldest Homo sapiens remains yet found.", "As with fossils, tool advancements appear in different places and times, suggesting that distinct groups of people evolved, and possibly later shared, these tool technologies. Those groups may include other humans who are not part of our own lineage.\nLast year a collection including sophisticated stone blades was discovered near Chennai, India, and dated to at least 250,000 years ago. The presence of this toolkit in India so soon after modern humans appeared in Africa suggests that other species may have also invented them independently\u2014or that some modern humans spread the technology by leaving Africa earlier than most current thinking suggests.\n100,000 to 210,000 Years Ago: Fossils Show Homo sapiens Lived Outside of Africa\nMany genetic analyses tracing our roots back to Africa make it clear that Homo sapiens originated on that continent. But it appears that we had a tendency to wander from a much earlier era than scientists had previously suspected.", "While earlier African emigres to the Middle East or China may have interbred with some of the more archaic hominids still living at that time, their lineage appears to have faded out or been overwhelmed by the later migration.\n15,000 to 40,000 Years Ago: Genetics and Fossils Show Homo sapiens Became the Only Surviving Human Species\nFor most of our history on this planet, Homo sapiens have not been the only humans. We coexisted, and as our genes make clear frequently interbred with various hominin species, including some we haven\u2019t yet identified. But they dropped off, one by one, leaving our own species to represent all humanity. On an evolutionary timescale, some of these species vanished only recently.", "Among the limestone cave systems of southern China, more evidence has turned up from between 80,000 and 120,000 years ago. A 100,000-year-old jawbone, complete with a pair of teeth, from Zhirendong retains some archaic traits like a less prominent chin, but otherwise appears so modern that it may represent Homo sapiens. A cave at Daoxian yielded a surprising array of ancient teeth, barely distinguishable from our own, which suggest that Homo sapiens groups were already living very far from Africa from 80,000 to 120,000 years ago.", "New discoveries are always adding key waypoints to the chart of our human journey. This timeline of Homo sapiens features some of the best evidence documenting how we evolved.\n550,000 to 750,000 Years Ago: The Beginning of the Homo sapiens Lineage\nGenes, rather than fossils, can help us chart the migrations, movements and evolution of our own species\u2014and those we descended from or interbred with over the ages.", "The remains of five individuals at Jebel Irhoud exhibit traits of a face that looks compellingly modern, mixed with other traits like an elongated brain case reminiscent of more archaic humans. The remains\u2019 presence in the northwestern corner of Africa isn\u2019t evidence of our origin point, but rather of how widely spread humans were across Africa even at this early date.\nOther very old fossils often classified as early Homo sapiens come from Florisbad, South Africa (around 260,000 years old), and the Kibish Formation along Ethiopia\u2019s Omo River (around 195,000 years old).", "The 160,000-year-old skulls of two adults and a child at Herto, Ethiopia, were classified as the subspecies Homo sapiens idaltu because of slight morphological differences including larger size. But they are otherwise so similar to modern humans that some argue they aren\u2019t a subspecies at all. A skull discovered at Ngaloba, Tanzania, also considered Homo sapiens, represents a 120,000-year-old individual with a mix of archaic traits and more modern aspects like smaller facial features and a further reduced brow.\nDebate over the definition of which fossil remains represent modern humans, given these disparities, is common among experts. So much so that some seek to simplify the characterization by considering them part of a single, diverse group.", "Even as they acquired the more modern anatomy seen in living humans, the ways our ancestors lived, and the tools they created, changed as well.\nHumans took a leap in tool tech with the Middle Stone Age some 300,000 years ago by making those finely crafted tools with flaked points and attaching them to handles and spear shafts to greatly improve hunting prowess. Projectile points like those Potts and colleagues dated to 298,000 to 320,000 years old in southern Kenya were an innovation that suddenly made it possible to kill all manner of elusive or dangerous prey. \u201cIt ultimately changed how these earliest sapiens interacted with their ecosystems, and with other people,\u201d says Potts.\nScrapers and awls, which could be used to work animal hides for clothing and to shave wood and other materials, appeared around this time. By at least 90,000 years ago barbed points made of bone\u2014like those discovered at Katanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2014were used to spearfish", "A jawbone found inside a collapsed cave on the slopes of Mount Carmel, Israel, reveals that modern humans dwelt there, alongside the Mediterranean, some 177,000 to 194,000 years ago. Not only are the jaw and teeth from Misliya Cave unambiguously similar to those seen in modern humans, they were found with sophisticated handaxes and flint tools.\nOther finds in the region, including multiple individuals at Qafzeh, Israel, are dated later. They range from 100,000 to 130,000 years ago, suggesting a long presence for humans in the region. At Qafzeh, human remains were found with pieces of red ocher and ocher-stained tools in a site that has been interpreted as the oldest intentional human burial.", "These lines of evidence increasingly indicate that H. sapiens originated in Africa, although not necessarily in a single time and place. Instead it seems diverse groups of human ancestors lived in habitable regions around Africa, evolving physically and culturally in relative isolation, until climate driven changes to African landscapes spurred them to intermittently mix and swap everything from genes to tool techniques. Eventually, this process gave rise to the unique genetic makeup of modern humans.\n\u201cEast Africa was a setting in foment\u2014one conducive to migrations across Africa during the period when Homo sapiens arose,\u201d says Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cIt seems to have been an ideal setting for the mixing of genes from migrating populations widely spread across the continent. The implication is that the human genome arose in Africa. Everyone is African, and yet not from any one part of Africa.\u201d", "Pinpoint dating isn't the strength of genetic analyses, as the 200,000-year margin of error shows. \u201cIn general, estimating ages with genetics is imprecise,\u201d says Joshua Akey, who studies evolution of the human genome at Princeton University. \u201cGenetics is really good at telling us qualitative things about the order of events, and relative time frames.\u201d Before genetics, these divergence dates were estimated by the oldest fossils of various lineages scientists found. In the case of H. sapiens, known remains only date back some 300,000 years, so gene studies have located the divergence far more accurately on our evolutionary timeline than bones alone ever could.", "While various groups of humans lived outside of Africa during this era, ultimately, they aren\u2019t part of our own evolutionary story. Genetics can reveal which groups of people were our distant ancestors and which had descendants who eventually died out.\n\u201cOf course, there could be multiple out of Africa dispersals,\u201d says Akey. \u201cThe question is whether they contributed ancestry to present day individuals and we can say pretty definitely now that they did not.\u201d\n50,000 to 60,000 Years Ago: Genes and Climate Reconstructions Show a Migration Out of Africa", "So when did fossils finally first show fully modern humans with all representative features? It\u2019s not an easy answer. One skull (but only one of several) from Omo Kibish looks much like a modern human at 195,000 years old, while another found in Nigeria\u2019s Iwo Eleru cave, appears very archaic, but is only 13,000 years old. These discrepancies illustrate that the process wasn\u2019t linear, reaching some single point after which all people were modern humans.\n300,000 Years Ago: Artifacts Show a Revolution in Tools\nOur ancestors used stone tools as long as 3.3 million years ago and by 1.75 million years ago they\u2019d adopted the Acheulean culture, a suite of chunky handaxes and other cutting implements that remained in vogue for nearly 1.5 million years. As recently as 400,000 years ago, thrusting spears used during the hunt of large prey in what is now Germany were state of the art. But they could only be used up close, an obvious and sometimes dangerous limitation.", "\u201cThe fact of the matter is that all fossils before about 40,000 to 100,000 years ago contain different combinations of so called archaic and modern features. It\u2019s therefore impossible to pick and choose which of the older fossils are members of our lineage or evolutionary dead ends,\u201d Scerri suggests. \u201cThe best model is currently one in which they are all early Homo sapiens, as their material culture also indicates.\u201d\nAs Scerri references, African material culture shows a widespread shift some 300,000 years ago from clunky, handheld stone tools to the more refined blades and projectile points known as Middle Stone Age toolkits.", "The long evolutionary journey that created modern humans began with a single step\u2014or more accurately\u2014with the ability to walk on two legs. One of our earliest-known ancestors, Sahelanthropus, began the slow transition from ape-like movement some six million years ago, but Homo sapiens wouldn\u2019t show up for more than five million years. During that long interim, a menagerie of different human species lived, evolved and died out, intermingling and sometimes interbreeding along the way. As time went on, their bodies changed, as did their brains and their ability to think, as seen in their tools and technologies.\nTo understand how Homo sapiens eventually evolved from these older lineages of hominins, the group including modern humans and our closest extinct relatives and ancestors, scientists are unearthing ancient bones and stone tools, digging into our genes and recreating the changing environments that helped shape our ancestors\u2019 world and guide their evolution.", "The oldest-recovered DNA of an early human relative comes from Sima de los Huesos, the \u201cPit of Bones.\u201d At the bottom of a cave in Spain\u2019s Atapuerca Mountains scientists found thousands of teeth and bones from 28 different individuals who somehow ended up collected en masse. In 2016, scientists painstakingly teased out the partial genome from these 430,000-year-old remains to reveal that the humans in the pit are the oldest known Neanderthals, our very successful and most familiar close relatives. Scientists used the molecular clock to estimate how long it took to accumulate the differences between this oldest Neanderthal genome and that of modern humans, and the researchers suggest that a common ancestor lived sometime between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.", "Even earlier migrations are possible; some believe evidence exists of humans reaching Europe as long as 210,000 years ago. While most early human finds spark some scholarly debate, few reach the level of the Apidima skull fragment, in southern Greece, which may be more than 200,000 years old and might possibly represent the earliest modern human fossil discovered outside of Africa. The site is steeped in controversy, however, with some scholars believing that the badly preserved remains look less those of our own species and more like Neanderthals, whose remains are found just a few feet away in the same cave. Others question the accuracy of the dating analysis undertaken at the site, which is tricky because the fossils have long since fallen out of the geological layers in which they were deposited.", "On the Indonesian island of Flores, fossils evidence a curious and diminutive early human species nicknamed \u201chobbit.\u201d Homo floresiensis appear to have been living until perhaps 50,000 years ago, but what happened to them is a mystery. They don\u2019t appear to have any close relation to modern humans including the Rampasasa pygmy group, which lives in the same region today.\nNeanderthals once stretched across Eurasia from Portugal and the British Isles to Siberia. As Homo sapiens became more prevalent across these areas the Neanderthals faded in their turn, being generally consigned to history by some 40,000 years ago. Some evidence suggests that a few die-hards might have held on in enclaves, like Gibraltar, until perhaps 29,000 years ago. Even today traces of them remain because modern humans carry Neanderthal DNA in their genome.", "All living non-Africans, from Europeans to Australia\u2019s aboriginal people, can trace most of their ancestry to humans who were part of a landmark migration out of Africa beginning some 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, according to numerous genetic studies published in recent years. Reconstructions of climate suggest that lower sea levels created several advantageous periods for humans to leave Africa for the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, including one about 55,000 years ago.\n\u201cJust by looking at DNA from present day individuals we\u2019ve been able to infer a pretty good outline of human history,\u201d Akey says. \u201cA group dispersed out of Africa maybe 50 to 60 thousand years ago, and then that group traveled around the world and eventually made it to all habitable places of the world.\u201d", "\u201cWe currently have no ancient DNA from Africa that even comes near the timeframes of our evolution\u2014a process that is likely to have largely taken place between 800,000 and 300,000 years ago,\u201d says Eleanor Scerri, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany.\n300,000 Years Ago: Fossils Found of Oldest Homo sapiens\nAs the physical remains of actual ancient people, fossils tell us most about what they were like in life. But bones or teeth are still subject to a significant amount of interpretation. While human remains can survive after hundreds of thousands of years, scientists can\u2019t always make sense of the wide range of morphological features they see to definitively classify the remains as Homo sapiens, or as different species of human relatives.", "Though our genes clearly show that modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans\u2014a mysterious hominin species that left behind substantial traces in our DNA but, so far, only a handful of tooth and bone remains\u2014do share a common ancestor, it\u2019s not apparent who it was. Homo heidelbergensis, a species that existed from 200,000 to 700,000 years ago, is a popular candidate. It appears that the African family tree of this species leads to Homo sapiens while a European branch leads to Homo neanderthalensis and the Denisovans.\nMore ancient DNA could help provide a clearer picture, but finding it is no sure bet. Unfortunately, the cold, dry and stable conditions best for long-term preservation aren\u2019t common in Africa, and few ancient African human genomes have been sequenced that are older than 10,000 years."], "title": "An Evolutionary Timeline of Homo Sapiens | Smithsonian"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life", "description": "Timeline of the evolutionary history of life", "snippets": ["- Bjornerud, Marcia (2005).

The push for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial justice movements has gained momentum in many parts of the world. Pop culture, too, has played a central role in shaping attitudes and trends, with the influence of entertainment, social media, and digital platforms reaching unprecedented heights.", "World War II: World War II, lasting from 1939 to 1945, was a catastrophic global conflict that resulted in the devastation of Europe and the Pacific. It led to the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers.\nCold War: The Cold War, spanning from 1947 to 1991, was a geopolitical standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. It was characterized by ideological competition, nuclear arms race, and proxy conflicts, shaping global politics for decades.\nContemporary Era\nThe Contemporary Era, often referred to as the modern age, spans from the end of the Cold War in 1991 to the present day.\nThis period is marked by profound changes in global politics, technology, society, and culture, making it one of the most dynamic and transformative periods in human history.", "The Prehistoric Era represents a vast stretch of time that predates the development of written records and recorded history.

This era was marked by the use of simple stone tools, nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles, and the mastery of fire. Prehistoric humans during this period gradually evolved and developed basic social structures.\n2. Mesolithic Period: Following the Paleolithic, the Mesolithic Era emerged around 10,000 BCE and continued until approximately 8,000 BCE. During this time, humans began to make more sophisticated tools and started experimenting with agriculture and animal domestication. This marked the transition from purely nomadic hunting and gathering to a more settled way of life.", "This era witnessed the rise of city-states like Athens and Sparta, as well as the philosophical teachings of figures like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\n2. Ancient Rome: The Ancient Roman civilization, extending from the 8th century BCE to the 5th century CE, is celebrated for its vast empire, engineering marvels, legal systems, and cultural achievements. The Roman Republic evolved into the Roman Empire, which had a profound influence on Western civilization.\n3. Han Dynasty in China: In parallel with the Greco-Roman world, the Han Dynasty in China, which lasted from 206 BCE to 220 CE, marked a golden age in Chinese history.\nIt saw advancements in technology, governance, and the arts. The Silk Road trade route flourished during this time, facilitating cultural exchange between East and West.\nMedieval Era", "Late Middle Ages: The Late Middle Ages, covering the 14th and 15th centuries CE, were marked by both progress and challenges.
