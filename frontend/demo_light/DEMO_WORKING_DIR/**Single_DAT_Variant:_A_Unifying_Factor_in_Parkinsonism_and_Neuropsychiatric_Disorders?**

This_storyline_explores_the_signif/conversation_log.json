This variant, also known as the KP.3.1.1 variant, has been found to cause profound dopamine dysfunction, leading to a higher risk of developing Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and bipolar disorder.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the KP.3.1.1 variant is currently estimated to be the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. It has been found to be more transmissible and partially able to escape from immunity, contributing to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nIn June 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) as the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 globally. This variant was first detected in India and has now spread to over 179 countries. It is also known to be more transmissible and potentially more deadly than previous variants.\n\nScientists have been studying the D614G mutation, which has been found to be the most commonly identified variant in various parts of the world. According to a study published in Cell, this mutation is being closely examined to determine if it is more transmissible or deadly.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of the DAT-K619N variant and its association with Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders is a significant finding that challenges previous notions about the genetic makeup of these diseases. Further research and genetic testing can help identify carriers and inform treatment plans and prevention strategies for these disorders.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine."], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time. Some variants emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.", "New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge. CDC closely tracks the numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States and globally. Our teams use multiple sources of genomic data from CDC, public health laboratories, and commercial diagnostic laboratories, to identify and monitor the spread of variants. Through detection and tracking of new variants, CDC is able to support outbreak preparedness and prevention efforts.\nAgain, KP.3.1.1 descended from KP.3, which descended from the Omicron family. Since the original Omicron variant first emerged in the fall of 2021, Omicron offshoots such as BA.5 and XBB.1.5 have become predominant and then subsequently replaced by other variants in the Omicron family.\nCOVID-19 activity remains elevated", "CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for all people ages 6 months and older to protect against serious illness from COVID-19.

Until then, those who have never been vaccinated, or are eligible for another dose, like adults ages 65 years and older and people with weakened immune systems, can talk to their healthcare provider about the currently available 2023\u20132024 COVID-19 vaccine.", "Early indicators such as test positivity rose to 18.3% for the week ending August 10, from 17.9% the week before. Emergency department visits diagnosed as COVID-19 have been rising since mid-May, initially in the West and now with the South and Southeast showing the highest levels. The wastewater viral activity level for COVID-19 has been rising since mid-May and is currently very high across most parts of the country.\nHospitalizations due to COVID-19, an indication of disease severity, have also been rising, albeit modestly.

Virologists call it the D614G mutation: at the 614th amino-acid position of the spike protein,ce the amino acid aspartate (D, in biochemical shorthand) was routinely being supplanted by glycine (G).\nSince the end of February 2020, this mutant increasingly inhabits a proportion of variants detected, which makes it the most commonly identified variant in various parts of the world at present. This key attribute has grabbed the attention of researchers ready to further investigate if the D614G mutation is more transmissible/infectious or more deadly?\nRecently, Cell published a research article titled \u201cStructural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant\u201d. Scientists examined the D614G mutation from various aspects of structural biology and cell biology. This article outlines some of the main points.", "As it stands, around 200 COVID-19 vaccine development studies are ongoing. When assessing the efficacy of the vaccine, researchers and scientists typically use spike protein or receptor binding domains to determine the antibody titer. It should be mentioned that Moderna used the D614G spike protein instead in these assays.\nTrimeric spike protein (D614G) products from ACROBiosystems\nACROBiosystems developed several stable recombinant spike trimer protein products such as ancestral D614G spike trimer protein and D614G spike trimer protein, as well as relevant protein-coupled magnetic beads, all of which are designed for advances in COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic development.\nFigure 1. The purity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (D614G), His Tag, Super stable trimer (Cat. No. SPN-C52H3) was more than 90% and the molecular weight of this protein is around 520-620 kDa verified by SEC-MALS. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems", "Consequently, a majority of the COVID-19 therapeutic antibodies currently in development target the receptor-binding domain of spike protein. While this structural change is non-conservative, it queries whether it will jeopardize the effectiveness of these therapeutic antibodies currently being developed: some studies were conducted using Regeneron antibodies.\nThe results of these studies are outlined below in Fig. 4, suggesting D614G and the ancestral D614 are uniformly sensitive to these neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain.\nFigure 4. Neutralization Potency of Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein Receptor-Binding Domain Is Not Attenuated by D614G. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems", "For SARS-CoV-2 to effectively penetrate human cells, the spike protein present on the virus surface must bind to the host receptor protein, ACE2. While D614G is situated outside of the receptor-binding domain, this mutation could transform ACE2-binding properties via allosteric effects.\nAs established by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results, as shown in Fig. 3, D614G reduces the affinity for ACE2 by intensifying the rate of dissociation. The data demonstrates that the enhanced infectivity of D614G cannot be explained by greater ACE2 binding strength.\nFigure 3.

The DAT-K619N variant has been found to affect dopamine regulation in the brain by impairing the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT). This transporter is responsible for regulating the levels of dopamine in the brain, which plays a crucial role in movement, cognition, and behavior. According to a study published in the journal Genome Medicine, this variant has been linked to both early-onset Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and bipolar disorder.\n\nFurther research has shown that carriers of this variant have a higher risk of developing these conditions, as the impairment of the DAT function can lead to dopamine dysfunction in the brain. This finding challenges previous notions that multiple alleles were needed for severe manifestations of these disorders and highlights the potential for genetic testing to identify carriers as part of prevention strategies.\n\nIn addition, this insight could also have significant implications for treatment plans and the future of genetic counseling for these disorders. With a better understanding of the genetic markers involved in these conditions, personalized treatment approaches could be developed to target specific genetic variations. This could potentially lead to more effective and tailored treatments for patients.\n\nI hope this information has clarified how the DAT-K619N variant affects dopamine regulation in the brain and its implications for neuropsychiatric conditions.", "user_utterance": "Could you clarify how the DAT-K619N variant specifically affects dopamine regulation in the brain, and what implications this has for neuropsychiatric conditions?", "search_queries": ["How does the DATK619N variant affect dopamine levels in the brain?", "What is the relationship between the DATK619N variant and neuropsychiatric disorders?", "Can a single copy of the DATK619N variant lead to profound dopamine dysfunction?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01265-5", "description": "Copy-number variants (CNVs) refer to duplicated or deleted DNA fragments (\u2265 50 bp) and represent an important source of inter-individual genetic variation [1, 2].As a highly diverse mutational class, CNVs can alter the copy-number of dosage-sensitive genes, induce gain- or loss-of-function (LoF) through gene fusion or truncation, unmask recessive alleles, or disrupt regulatory sequences ...", "snippets": ["Cases and controls were defined for 60 ICD-10-based clinical diagnoses using diagnosis \u2013 ICD10 (#41270), cancer code, self-reported (#20001), and non-cancer illness code, self-reported (#20002) to build exclusion and inclusion lists. For each disease, starting with the selected subset of 331,522 individuals previously described, we identified cases as individuals having received a specific, restricted set of ICD-10 codes matching our disease definition (i.e., inclusion list). We then defined our controls as individuals lacking both ICD-10 codes matching the case definition and self-reported or ICD-10 diagnoses of a broad set of conditions related to the assessed disorder (i.e., exclusion list). For instance, breast cancer controls should not have other cancers or radio-/chemotherapy, while schizophrenia controls should not have mood or personality disorders.

While we regressed covariates out of disease status to render the outcome quantitative, more sophisticated approaches have recently been developed for SNP-based GWASs that transform binary outcomes into continuous liability scores while borrowing information from age of disease onset, sex, and familial history . Future exploration is warranted to assess the benefit of this approach in the context of CNV-GWASs. By coupling a CNV-GWAS framework that accounts for challenges linked to disease CNV association studies in population cohorts to extensive validation, we generated a list of 73 CNV-disease pairs with various levels of supporting evidence that can inform follow-up studies.", "Global characterization of disease-associated CNV regions", ". This indicates that while part of the increased disease risk among individuals with GDs represents a mere comorbidity of obesity, other BMI-independent mechanisms further contribute to the high disease burden observed in these individuals. In the future, it will be important to assess the role of other possible confounders, such as clinical biomarkers or socioeconomic status, as such knowledge can guide preventive strategies and improve understanding of disease mechanisms. While awaiting validation in clinical cohorts of CNV carriers, we hope that these findings will improve clinical characterization of GDs, thereby facilitating diagnosis and allowing physicians to anticipate later-onset comorbidities. For instance, we found carriers of 16p13", "All results in this study are based on the human genome reference build GRCh37/hg19.

Briefly, CNVs were called using standard PennCNV settings and samples with abnormal CNV profile were excluded. Remaining CNVs were attributed a probabilistic quality score (QS) that reflects the likelihood that the CNV call is a true positive . The QS ranges from \u2212 1 (likely deletion) to 1 (likely duplication), with intermediate values around 0 reflecting less confident CNV calls . High-confidence CNVs, stringently defined by |QS|> 0", ". As CNVs can act through different gene dosage mechanisms, four association models were assessed: mirror and U-shape models consider deletions and duplications simultaneously, assuming that they impact disease risk in opposite or identical direction, respectively, while the CNV type-specific duplication- and deletion-only models assess independently the effect of duplications and deletions, respectively.

Finally, the disease burden was calculated as the number of diagnoses (out of the 60 assessed ones) an individual has received.

Risk for 25 diseases, as well as the disease burden, were significantly increased by the R1 CNV burden subset and included associations with eight diseases that were not picked up by the total burden association (Fig. 7B; \u201cR1 burden\u201d; Tables S7). We observed a substantial contribution of the R2 burden subset to the risk of diseases such as epilepsy, hypertension, cardiac conduction disorders, AKI, CKD, and hypothyroidism, even though the pleiotropy of this partition was more moderate than the one of the R1 burden subset (Fig. 7B; \u201cR2 burden\u201d; Tables S7)", ". Characterization of the pleiotropic pathological consequences of recurrent CNVs at 15q13, 16p13.11, 16p12.2, and 22q11.2 in adulthood indicated variable expressivity of these regions and the involvement of multiple genes. Finally, we show that while the total burden of rare CNVs\u2014and especially deletions\u2014strongly associated with disease risk, it only accounted for ~ 0.02% of the UKBB disease burden. These associations are mainly driven by CNVs at known GD CNV regions, whose pleiotropic effect on common diseases was broader than anticipated by our CNV-GWAS.", ". While our burden analysis revealed that these associations mainly stem from known GDs, it also highlights that the latter are even more pleiotropic than what appears from our CNV-GWAS, implying that increased power will broaden the spectrum of common diseases associated with rare GDs.", "- Research\n- Open access\n- Published:\nRare copy-number variants as modulators of common disease susceptibility\nGenome Medicine volume 16, Article number: 5 (2024)\nAbstract\nBackground\nCopy-number variations (CNVs) have been associated with rare and debilitating genomic disorders (GDs) but their impact on health later in life in the general population remains poorly described.\nMethods\nAssessing four modes of CNV action, we performed genome-wide association scans (GWASs) between the copy-number of CNV-proxy probes and 60 curated ICD-10 based clinical diagnoses in 331,522 unrelated white British UK Biobank (UKBB) participants with replication in the Estonian Biobank.\nResults", ". Illustrating the added value of the burden analysis, nine diseases showed a burden association despite lacking any CNV-GWAS signal. In some cases, such as for hypothyroidism, the burden signal originated from GDs that did not yield any significant CNV-GWAS associations, possibly because the involved regions did not pass the \u2265 0.01% CNV frequency filter. In other cases, such as for osteoporosis, the signal appeared to emanate from the CNVRs pick-up by the CNV-GWAS, indicating that we were likely underpowered to detect associations with any specific region.

First, we assessed post hoc the p-value of the 2-by-3 genotypic Fisher tests (\u201cCovariate and probe selection\u201d). Second, we transformed the binary disease status into a continuous variable by computing the response residuals of the logistic regression of disease status on disease-relevant covariates. This allowed to use linear regressions to estimate the effect of the CNV genotype, encoded according to all significantly associated models in the primary analysis, on disease risk.

Furthermore, as different population cohorts are genotyped with different arrays, partial probe overlap hinders replication power in external biobanks, as well as the ability to meta-analyze summary statistics. We speculate that small and/or multiallelic CNVs that can only be uncovered by sequencing will have a genetic architecture closer to the one of SNPs and indels, with higher frequencies and more subtle effect sizes.

UKBB has approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) as a Research Tissue Bank (RTB) and all participants signed a broad informed consent form. The activities of the EstBB are regulated by the Human Genes Research Act, which was adopted in 2000 specifically for the operations of the EstBB. Individual-level data analysis in the EstBB was carried out under ethical approval 1.1\u201312/624 from the Estonian Committee on Bioethics and Human Research (Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs), using data according to release application 3\u201310/GI/34668 [20/12/2022] from the EstBB. All participants signed a broad informed consent form. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration.\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nCompeting interests", "Across the 45 disease-associated CNVRs, CNV frequencies were low, ranging between 0.01% (our frequency cutoff) and 0.36%, with 87% (39/45) of CNVRs having a frequency \u2264 0.1% (Fig. 2A). Consequently, associations rely on a low number of diseased CNV carriers and require validation (Fig. 1A; bottom; Fig. 2B; Additional file 3: Table S4). We used three statistical approaches to assess the robustness of CNV-disease associations: (i) Fisher test, (ii) residual regression, and (iii) time-to-event analysis through CoxPH modeling. We replicated 28/70 (40%), 23/70 (33%), and 70/70 (100%) of the associations with the respective methods at the arbitrary validation threshold of p \u2264 10\u22124. This allowed to stratify associations in confidence tiers, with 17 signals replicating with all methods (tier 1), 20 with two (tier 2), and 36 only through time-to-event analysis (tier 3)", "In parallel, we gathered literature evidence linking genetic variation at CNVRs with relevant phenotypes (Additional file 3: Table S4). Forty-eight signals (48/73 = 64%) mapped to a CNVR harboring a least one OMIM morbid gene and in 15 cases, the gene was linked to a Mendelian disorder sharing phenotypic features with the associated common disease. For instance, association between 4q35 CNVs and corneal conditions (chr4:186,687,554\u2013187,182,384; ORU-shape = 18.2; 95%-CI [5.2; 63.1]; p = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126) mapped to CYP4V2 [MIM: 608614], a gene associated with autosomal recessive Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy [MIM: 210370], a disorder that impairs vision and progresses to blindness by age 50\u201360 years . We next assessed whether SNPs overlapping disease-associated CNVRs were reported to associate with the implicated disease or a biomarker thereof in the GWAS Catalog", ". In the future, longitudinal follow-up of UKBB participants will increase the number of cases\u2014especially for late-onset diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s diseases\u2014allowing better powered CNV-GWASs. Larger and more diverse biobanks linking genotype to phenotype data  should both validate reported associations and identify new ones.", ". Overall, this argues against a dichotomic view on dominant versus recessive modes of inheritance and analogously to allelic series , suggests that Mendelian and common diseases represent different ends of the phenotypic spectrum caused by genetic variation at a given locus. We further show that nine CNVRs previously linked to pediatric GDs also increased risk for a broad spectrum of adult-onset common diseases. These associations were probably overlooked as the medical consequences in adulthood of these etiologies are often poorly characterized owing to ascertainment bias and difficulty to gather large cohorts. Importantly, 12 out of 24 associations mapping to a GD linked to altered BMI remained significant when accounting for the latter", ". Seven diseases had a median age of onset \u2264 60 years, predominantly female reproductive disorders, autoimmune conditions, and psychiatric diseases. Conversely, the nine diseases with a median age of onset \u2265 70 years were mainly degenerative disorders of the brain, eye, and kidney, overall aligning with epidemiological knowledge of the respective diseases (Fig. 1B).", "The Estonian Biobank (EstBB) is a population-based cohort of ~ 208,000 Estonian individuals (65% females; data freeze 2022v01 [12/04/2022]) for which microarray-based genotyping data and ICD-10 codes from crosslinking with national and hospital databases (up to end 2021) are available .\nSoftware versions\nCNVs were called with PennCNV v1.0.5  using PennCNV-Affy (27/08/2009) and filtered based on a quality scoring pipeline . Genetic analyses were conducted with PLINK v1.9 and v2.0 . ANNOVAR (24/10/2019) was used to map genes to genetic regions . Whenever genomic coordinates needed to be converted between builds, the UCSC Genome Browser LiftOver tool was used . Statistical analyses were performed with R v3.6.1, and graphs were generated with R v4.1.3.\nCNV association studies in the UK Biobank\nMicroarray-based CNV calling", "In the UKBB, individual-level CNV, duplication, and deletion burden were calculated as the number of Mb or genes affected by high-confidence (|QS|> 0.5) autosomal CNVs, duplications, and deletions, respectively, yielding six CNV burden metrices, as previously described . Variance explained by these six CNV burden metrices was estimated by fitting logistic or linear regressions predicting disease outcome or disease burden as a function of the CNV burden metric (without any covariates) and assessing the McFadden pseudo-R2 or the adjusted R2 of the regression, respectively. Association between the six CNV burden metrices and the 60 diseases (logistic regression) or the disease burden (linear regression) were assessed including disease-relevant covariates in the model. Accounting for the 61 evaluated traits, significance was defined at p \u2264 0.05/61 = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22124.\nCNV burden association studies corrected for CNV-GWAS signals", "Corroborating the deleterious impact of rare CNVs on an individual\u2019s health parameters, socioeconomic status, and lifespan , we here speculate that the CNV burden acts on the latter by increasing risk for a broad range of common diseases beyond their known role in neuropsychiatric disorders . While both duplications and deletions contributed to increased disease risk, the deletion burden\u2019s impact was much stronger\u2014especially for metabolic, psychiatric, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal diseases\u2014in line with the commonly accepted view that deletions tend to be more deleterious. While only a marginal fraction of the CNV burden\u2019s contribution to disease risk was captured by CNV-GWAS signals, burden associations were mainly driven by known GDs. Only psychiatric disorders and the disease burden retained a significant association with the CNV burden when accounting for GDs, highlighting the polygenic CNV architecture of these traits", ". Alternatively, high-throughput studies have assessed a broad range of continuous and binary traits simultaneously  without any precautions to accommodate the aforementioned challenges. To date, the largest disease CNV-GWAS meta-analyzed ~ 1,000,000 individuals . While boosting power through increased sample size, it comes at the cost of extensive data harmonization, resulting in the exclusion of smaller CNVs (\u2264 100 kb) and usage of broader disease categories (e.g., \u201cimmune abnormality\u201d). Moreover, as this study includes several clinical cohorts, phenotypes are biased towards neuropsychiatric disorders (24/54 phenotypes) for which the role of CNVs is well-established .", "De Kovel CGF, Trucks H, Helbig I, Mefford HC, Baker C, Leu C, et al.

Enrichment for tier 1 and 2 associations (\u201cStatistical confidence tiers\u201d) among experiment-wide, as opposed to genome-wide, significant signals was assessed with a two-sided Fisher test.", "By aggregating CNVs into a burden, we capture the effect of ultra-rare CNVs (frequency \u2264 0.01%), as well as those whose effect is not strong enough to reach GW significance under current settings, increasing our power to detect the global pathogenic impact of CNVs on human health. Individual-level autosomal CNV (duplication + deletion), duplication, and deletion burdens were calculated as the number of Mb or genes affected by the considered type of CNV. The predictive value of these six CNV burden metrices on the same 60 diseases (and the disease burden) previously assessed through CNV-GWAS was estimated (Fig. 7A; \u201cmiddle\u201d). Disease burden strongly associated with a high CNV load (\u03b2del = + 0.03 disease per deleted gene; p = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221227) and risk for 20 individual disorders was increased by at least one type of CNV burden (p \u2264 0.05/61 = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22124; Fig. 7B; \u201ctotal burden\u201d; Additional file 3: Table S7)", ". Consistent with this model, ABCC6 plays a role in vascular calcification as the causal gene for generalized arterial calcification of infancy [MIM: 614473] , typically diagnosed by hypertension in newborns. Interestingly, the previously described mirror association with ALP (chr16:15,070,916\u201316,276,964; \u03b2mirror = 6.6 U/L; p = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22127; UKBB field #30610) peaks at the distal end of the CNVR , nearby a suggestive SNP-GWAS signal for ALP levels (Fig. 5H). Splitting ALP levels by CNV category revealed that this mirroring effect is driven by individuals with cat2 deletion (mean = 76.4 U/L; pt-test = 9.7 \u00d7 10\u22123) and duplication (mean = 92.9 U/L; pt-test = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22125), as other CNV carriers had ALP levels indistinguishable from those of copy-neutral individuals (mean = 83.6 U/L) (Fig. 5I). Hence, we propose the distal region of the CNVR to harbor the critical region regulating ALP levels, even though no obvious candidate gene could be identified in the literature.", "Association between disease risk and copy-number of CNV-proxy probes was assessed through logistic regression with Firth fallback (--covar-variance-standardize --glm firth-fallback omit-ref no-x-sex hide-covar --ci 0.95 PLINK v2.0), using disease- and model-specific probes and covariates (\u201cCovariate and probe selection\u201d). Four association models were assessed: the mirror model assessed the additive effect of each additional copy (PLINKCNV file set); the U-shape model assessed a consistent effect of any deviation from the copy-neutral state (PLINKCNV file set, using the \u201chetonly\u201d option in --glm PLINK v2.0); the duplication-only model (PLINKDUP file set) assessed the impact of a duplication while disregarding deletions; the deletion-only model (PLINKDEL file set) assessed the impact of a deletion while disregarding duplications", ". We also highlight several examples where deviations by one copy-number are linked to common diseases which share clinical features with rare Mendelian conditions caused by homozygous perturbations of the same genetic region. For instance, risk for kidney stones is gradually increased in carriers of partial versus full ABBC6 deletions. Another intriguing example is the association between a relatively common CNV (frequency = 0.22%) affecting exon 2 and intron 2\u20133 of PRKN [MIM: 602544]\u2014a gene causing juvenile autosomal recessive Parkinson\u2019s disease [MIM: 600116]\u2014and sleep disorders such as insomnia and hypersomnia. As sleep disturbances are among the earliest symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease , follow-up studies should determine whether these individuals are more prone to develop Parkinson\u2019s disease", ". No association was detected at GW significance by both the duplication-only and deletion-only models, so that each signal was attributed a \u201cmain model\u201d that indicates whether the association is primarily driven by duplications or deletions (Fig. 2). The main model should be interpreted with caution as both deletions and duplications might influence disease risk but only one CNV type-specific model might reach GW significance, due for instance to higher frequency of one CNV type. This is particularly relevant as 73% of the 45 disease-associated CNVRs have a higher duplication than deletion frequency (Fig. 2A). Hence, 20 out of 21 (95%) of signals mainly driven by duplications were also identified by the mirror/U-shape model(s) and contribution of deletions cannot be excluded.", ".0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.", "Main CNV-GWAS model", "UKBB and EstBB data are available for registered users.

Average BMI (#21001) over available instances was used. For an association to be tested for possible confounding, we required that (i) BMI significantly associated with disease risk (p \u2264 0.05/61 = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22124) in a model including all disease-specific covariates and (ii) the CNV genotype of the lead probe encoded numerically according to the best model to significantly associate with BMI (p \u2264 0.05/73 = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22124) previously inverse normal transformed and corrected for age, age2, sex, genotyping batch, and PC1-40. Twenty-five association signals matched these criteria and for them, we fitted a logistic regression (or linear regression for the disease burden) with disease status as outcome and lead probe encoded numerically according to the best model, disease-specific covariates, and BMI as predictors", "Due to the recurrent nature of CNVs, the copy-number status of the 18,725 probes retained after frequency filter and pruning remain highly correlated and are thus not independent. Accounting for these 18,725 probes would result in an overly strict multiple testing correction. Using an established protocol , we estimated the chromosome-level number of effective tests and summed them up, resulting in an estimate of Neff = 6,633, setting the genome-wide (GW) threshold for significance at p \u2264 0.05/6,633 = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22126.

Microarray CNV calls also exhibit high false positive rates . By using stringent CNV selection criteria, we decrease the latter at the cost of decreasing power to detect true associations. This aspect is particularly relevant given that the type of CNVs we assess are rare and that the UKBB is not enriched for disease cases , resulting in low-powered GWASs. While we adopt strategies to counter the lack of power, our results are likely subject to Winner\u2019s curse, only capturing a fraction of the strongest, possibly overestimated effects. This phenomenon might be compensated by UKBB CNV carriers being at the milder end of the clinical spectrum, leading to effect underestimation. An interesting question will be to compare effect sizes from population-based studies to those emerging from clinical cohorts", ". In other cases, our data suggests that multiple subregions of the CNVR contribute to increased risk for a given disease, as observed for 22q11.2 and ischemic heart disease (Additional file 1: Note S10) or 16p13.11 and hypertension. Interestingly, the putative driver for phenotypes originally associated with a CNVR might not be driving our newly identified associations, as shown for the 15q13 CNVR, whose non-neurological phenotypes do not appear to be linked to altered dosage of CHRNA7. Beyond characterizing the pleiotropic pathological consequences of recurrent CNVRs, we demonstrate that dissection of CNV-GWAS signals can fine-map associations and provide mechanistic insights into their phenotypic expression.", "Copy-number variants (CNVs) refer to duplicated or deleted DNA fragments (\u2265 50 bp) and represent an important source of inter-individual genetic variation . As a highly diverse mutational class, CNVs can alter the copy-number of dosage-sensitive genes, induce gain- or loss-of-function (LoF) through gene fusion or truncation, unmask recessive alleles, or disrupt regulatory sequences, thereby representing potent phenotypic modifiers . As such, their role in human disease has mainly been studied in clinically ascertained cohorts, often presenting with congenital anomalies and/or severe neurological (e.g., developmental delay and intellectual disability or epilepsy) or psychiatric (e.g., autism or schizophrenia) symptoms .

Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nThe good news is that in the early spring of 2024, COVID-19 cases were down, with far fewer infections and hospitalizations than were seen in the previous winter. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "To better understand how the FLiRT strains emerged, it might help to see how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed over time, with new variants forming as mutations emerged in its genetic code. Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2. What do we know\u2014and not know\u2014about the FLiRT and LB.1 variants?", "The FLiRT strains are subvariants of Omicron, and together they accounted for the majority of COVID cases in the U.S. at the beginning of July. One of them, KP.3, was responsible for 36.9% of COVID infections in the United States, KP.2 made up 24.4%, and KP.1.1 accounted for 9.2% of cases.\nThe LB.1 strain, which similar to the FLiRT variants but with an additional mutation, has attracted attention as well. As summer began, it was responsible for 14.9% of COVID cases. (The percentages are based on CDC Nowcast estimates, which provide projections that can change as more data is reported.)\nMeanwhile, during the same period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant COVID uptick in several states, based on spikes in emergency room visits and detections of the virus in wastewater. (Wastewater testing can help detect the spread of a COVID in a community.)", "\u201cViruses mutate all the time, so I\u2019m not surprised to see a new coronavirus variant taking over,\u201d says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. If anything, he says the new mutations are confirmation that the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a bit of a wild card, where it\u2019s always difficult to predict what it will do next. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing it will continue to mutate.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest question, Dr. Roberts says, is whether the newly mutated virus will continue to evolve before the winter, when infections and hospitalizations usually rise, and if a new fall COVID vaccine will target them.\nBelow, Dr. Roberts answers three questions about the FLiRT variants.\n1. Where did the FLiRT and LB.1 strains come from?", "There is no conclusive information yet about whether a COVID illness will be more severe with the new variants or how symptoms might change. Because everyone is different, a person\u2019s symptoms and the severity of their COVID disease usually depend less on which variant they are infected with and more on their immunity and overall health, the CDC says.\n3. How can people protect themselves against the FLiRT and LB.1 strains?\nVaccination is still a key strategy, says Dr. Roberts, adding that everyone eligible for COVID vaccination should make sure they are up to date with the latest COVID vaccines. While vaccination may not prevent infection, it significantly lowers a person\u2019s risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID.", "\u201cI would especially recommend anyone who qualifies for the vaccine because of advanced age get it if they haven\u2019t already,\u201d Dr. Roberts adds. \u201cThe reason is that the biggest risk factor for a bad outcome from COVID is advanced age.\u201d Anyone over age 65 is eligible for both the first updated vaccine offered in the fall of 2023, and a second shot four months later.\nHe also says COVID tests should be able to detect strains related to JN.1, and antiviral treatments should remain effective against them. Paxlovid, the primary treatment for most people with COVID, acts on a \u201cnonspiked part of the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's relatively variant-proof, so it should really act against many future COVID iterations.\u201d\nOther preventive efforts can help. You can avoid getting too close to people who are sick, mask strategically, wash hands properly, improve ventilation, and stay aware of COVID transmission levels where you live and work.

This variant has been linked to both early-onset Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and bipolar disorder (1). It was first identified in a patient with early-onset Parkinsonism and comorbid neuropsychiatric disease, and subsequent research has found it to be a rare but recurrent variant in individuals with these conditions (2). This groundbreaking discovery challenges previous beliefs that multiple genetic mutations were necessary for severe manifestations of these disorders and highlights the potential for genetic testing to identify carriers as part of prevention strategies (1).\n\nFurther research on the DAT-K619N variant has revealed its potential to have dominant-negative actions, meaning that a single copy of the variant can lead to profound dopamine dysfunction (2). This insight has significant implications for understanding the pathophysiology of these diseases and could potentially inform treatment plans in the future (2). Additionally, the identification of this variant has the potential to revolutionize genetic counseling for Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders, allowing for more precise and individualized care.\n\nDespite the critical role of dopamine in Parkinson's disease, there is currently no treatment available to slow or halt its progression. This lack of understanding of the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson's has hindered the development of effective medications (3).

This highlights the importance of understanding the potential health implications of this variant and the need for continued research on its role in both Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nIn the case of genetic testing, sometimes individuals may receive a result of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), as seen with the DAT-K619N variant.

Available drugs don\u2019t slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson\u2019s, it\u2019s improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.", "In the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson\u2019s might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson\u2019s: linkage analysis and association studies.\nLinkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson\u2019s, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson\u2019s appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.", "Many factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson\u2019s, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson\u2019s aren\u2019t inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.\nNevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson\u2019s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations", "\u201cLinkage\u201d between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes. Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson\u2019s. Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson\u2019s in the general population.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease. However, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \u201clinked\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson\u2019s. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson\u2019s? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "Conversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson\u2019s with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don\u2019t have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analyzing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people.", "Parkinson\u2019s disease genes\nUsing linkage analysis, my team and I identified a new genetic mutation for Parkinson\u2019s disease called RAB32 Ser71Arg. This mutation was linked to parkinsonism in three families and found in 13 other people in several countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Tunisia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nAlthough the affected individuals and families originate from many parts of the world, they share an identical fragment of chromosome 6 that contains RAB32 Ser71Arg. This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify.\nWith further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease. The RAB32 Ser71Arg variant also causes similar dysfunction within cells.", "RAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries. The proteins encoded bring together three important functions of the cell: autophagy, immunity and mitochondrial function. While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell\u2019s trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell\u2019s immune system recognizes as \u201cself\u201d rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson\u2019s is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease.

The more genes you look at, the more variants of uncertain significance you\u2019ll find.\nHow do genetic variants arise?\nOur bodies contain 70 trillion cells. Every day, old cells die and give birth to new ones. Each time this happens, the new cells copy DNA from the old cells.

But about 20 years ago when the first sequences of the human genome were published, scientists realized that instead of being rarities that almost invariably harm health, variants occur frequently throughout the human genome. The average human carries around 400 unique variants, and most of us are none the worse because of them.\nHow will I know when my VUS has been reclassified?\nWhen a VUS is reclassified, the laboratory that performed your test sends a revised report to your genetic counselor, explaining how and why the variant was reclassified. Your genetic counselor then contacts you to explain the updated results and what they mean for you and your family. For this reason, it\u2019s very important for MD Anderson patients to keep their mailing address, email address and phone number up-to-date in MyChart.\nIf I have a variant of uncertain significance, should my family members be tested?", "Before patients undergo genetic testing, we counsel them about the risks and limitations of testing. If they\u2019re particularly anxious, we may suggest they forgo testing altogether, or test fewer genes to lessen the chance of finding a VUS. We remind them that most variants of uncertain significance are harmless. But even with the right genetic counseling, uncertainty can be difficult.\nHow can scientists learn more about variants of uncertain significance?\nTo get a handle on a variant\u2019s role in cancer, researchers must test millions of people, and share their data. If a VUS is found in a significant number of people who have cancer, but absent in those who don\u2019t, there\u2019s an increased likelihood that it could be associated with higher cancer risks.\nBut regardless of how extensive the databases get and how many people undergo genetic testing, uncertainty will never completely go away. Every time new cells replace old cells and copy their DNA, variants can arise.", "Because we don\u2019t understand your variant, it generally would not be helpful for your family members to get tested. The tests wouldn\u2019t clarify their cancer risks and therefore wouldn\u2019t change the way their doctors are already managing their medical care. Instead, medical decisions should be based on their personal or family history of cancer.\nThat being said, there are times when multiple members in a family affected by cancer are tested to determine whether the same variant is present in those with cancer, or absent in those without. Your genetic counselor will notify you if testing other family members will help classify your variant.\nHow does my VUS change my medical treatment?\nIt doesn\u2019t.

It was believed to be first identified in the brain by Kathleen Montagu in her 1957 paper demonstrating findings on key neurotransmitters.\nAs part of her research, she examined the quantities of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and 3-hydroxytryramine from extracted brain tissues of several species.\nMontagu speculated that there might be an additional catecholamine similar to hydroxytyramine, which she later confirmed to be what is known as dopamine. Arvid Carlsson published research in the same year that confirmed dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain, as opposed to another precursor molecule.\nDopamine is highly concentrated in areas of the brain called the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain. Other brain areas where dopamine can be made are the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb.", "This dopamine pathway is highly involved in the functions of pleasure and reward. Beginning at the VTA, dopamine produced here projects to the nucleus accumbens.\nWhen here, dopamine primarily mediates feelings of pleasure and reward. For instance, if someone eats a food they enjoy, dopamine is released from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens which then creates positive feelings that reinforce the behavior.\nSometimes stimuli can create intense feelings of euphoria.\nThe nucleus accumbens is found in the ventral striatum and is part of a complex circuit involving the amygdala and the hippocampus. The activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway communicates that it wants to repeat what just happened to feel the rewarding sensation again.\nSince the nucleus accumbens has connections to the amygdala, a region of the limbic system associated with emotions, this attributes feelings towards the experienced reward.", "\u2013 Learning to meditate or undertaking mindfulness training\n\u2013 Exercising regularly\n\u2013 Changes in diet to increase levels of vitamin D and essential fatty acids\n\u2013 Physical therapy for muscle stiffness and movement problems\nDopamine agonists \u2013 a class of drugs that bind to and activate dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the action of naturally-occurring dopamine in the brain.\nFor those with too much dopamine, such as individuals with schizophrenia, dopamine antagonists are usually recommended.\nThese are a class of drugs that bind to and block dopamine receptors, turning down the dopamine activity.\nMany antipsychotic drugs are dopamine antagonists, including Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), Risperidone (Risperdal), and Clozapine (Clozaril).\nWhat happens when you \u2018dopamine fast\u2019?", "Also, dopamine abnormalities in the temporal and prefrontal areas of the brain are believed to be overactive in those with schizophrenia and thus can lead to some of the positive symptoms of the condition, such as hallucinations and delusions.\nThis hypothesis aligns with the use of some antipsychotic drug medications, which work to block dopamine receptor in the brain appear to be effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.\nLikewise, the effects of dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine, over repeated exposure, may gradually induce paranoid psychosis in non-schizophrenic people.\nThis well-documented observation shows that sustained increases in dopamine activity can cause some of the similar symptoms of schizophrenia.\nHowever, the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia may be an oversimplification as there may be many other neuronal network abnormalities and neurotransmitter systems involved in causing the condition.", "In the anticipation phase, where participants were told they might win money, blood flow was found in the amygdala and frontal cortex, indicating activity in the nucleus accumbens and the hypothalamus, all rich in dopamine receptors.\nThe bigger the potential reward, the greater dopamine-led brain activity was found.\nConditioned reinforcement\nBy allowing dopamine to affect choices, it can bias towards choosing the stimulus that was learned from the amount of positive or negative reinforcement the stimulus received.\nReward-associated motivational stimuli can serve as conditioned reinforcers when given after a response.\nFor instance, in a study on rats, when they were thirsty, they learned to work for the presentation of a light that was previously paired with water.", "Carlsson, A.

In excess, dopamine can be a contributing factor in mania, hallucinations, and delusions.\nA surplus of dopamine can result in more competitive behaviors, aggression, poor control over impulses, gambling behaviors, and addiction.\nAs such, addictive drugs can increase levels of dopamine, encouraging the individual to continue to use these drugs to reach that pleasurable feeling of reward.\nThis does not just have to be an addiction to drugs; people can be addicted to anything which gives them a surge of dopamine, such as video games, food, and social media use.\nHow do I get my dopamine levels back to normal?\nDepending on whether dopamine levels are too high or low will determine what techniques to take.

This can include phone use, social media, video games, delicious food, sex, and social interaction.\nTaking breaks from behaviors that trigger strong amounts of dopamine release could allow the brain to recover and restore itself, being an antidote to the age of overstimulation we live in.\nKent Berridge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience, suggests that taking a break from a stimulating activity (or all of them) will not reset dopamine levels, but it can stop the dopamine system from turning on constantly.\nDopamine fast is not believed to be something that can reduce dopamine, but having breaks from one or two pleasurable activities at a time can help in reducing impulsive behaviors.", "Pietrangelo, A.

Potential treatments now consider balancing these levels, exemplified by drugs like aripiprazole (Carlsson, 1988).\nThere appear to be abnormalities in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways that carry dopamine from the VTA to areas of the cerebral cortex.\nDisruptions in the parts of the cerebral cortex are believed to cause many of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as disorganized thinking, difficulty integrating thoughts, and poor concentration.\nAbnormal activity of dopamine pathways in the limbic system is believed to be responsible for many of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as lack of motivation and social withdrawal.", "When such events became predictable, the neurons were found to respond to the more distal (visual or auditory) stimuli that precede and predict the availability of the reward.\nThe neurons would then stop responding to the proximal contact with the reward (Romo & Schultz, 1990; Schultz et al., 1992).\nThis may be an oversimplification as the neurons that are no longer reactive to the proximal reward stimuli have been found to still be responsive to the lack of the reward.\nWhen the expected proximal contact does not occur, the dopamine neurons become inhibited. So, although dopamine release is triggered by the earliest reliable predictor of reward, midbrain dopamine remains sensitive to the receipt or lack of reward.\nThe anticipation of expecting a reward was studied by researchers in a game of chance.", "Through the use of dopamine receptors, the effects of dopamine, such as movement coordination, pleasure, and cognition, can take effect.\nWhere is dopamine produced?\nDopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA: a dopamine-rich nucleus located within the midbrain) and the substantia nigra.\nOnce produced in the VTA, dopamine is transported to other areas of the brain through different dopamine pathways, the two main ones being the mesolimbic and the mesocorticol pathways. Other pathways include the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways.\nDopamine pathways are neuronal connections in which dopamine travels to areas of the brain and body to convey important information such as executive thinking, cognition, feelings of reward and pleasure, and voluntary movement.\nMesolimbic pathways", "There are dopamine pathways that can be triggered when exposed to a stimulus that is rewarding, resulting in increased amounts of dopamine circulating around brain areas.\nRole Of Dopamine On Learning And Motivation\nReward System\nDopamine plays a key role in the brain\u2019s reward system. This neurotransmitter helps to reinforce certain behaviors that result in a reward.\nIn classical studies of rats, a surge of dopamine prompts the animal to press a lever to get a pellet of food repeatedly.\nThis works similarly in humans, for instance, when choosing to eat more pleasurable food, such as another slice of cake, because we have enjoyed the rewarding feeling the food has given us.\nReward Prediction\nSome lines of study have found that midbrain dopamine neurons can be activated by proximal contact (touch, taste) with unexpected rewards.", "This dopamine pathway is involved in motor planning. The dopamine projections start in the substantia nigra, a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain.\nThese projections go to the caudate and putamen, which are also parts of the basal ganglia. The neurons in this pathway stimulate purposeful movement and contain about 80% of the dopamine in the brain.\nIf there are reductions in the number of dopamine neurons in this pathway, this can result in motor control impairments, including movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nSymptoms of dysfunction in this pathway may include spasms, contractions, tremors, and motor restlessness.\nTuberoinfundibular pathways\nThe dopamine neurons in this pathway originate in the hypothalamus, an area that plays a role in hormone production and helps to stimulate many important processes in the body.", "Specifically, the neurons are in the arcuate and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. These then project to the infundibular region of the hypothalamus. In this pathway, dopamine is released into the portal circulation that connects this region to the pituitary gland.\nHere, dopamine functions to inhibit prolactin release. Prolactin is a protein secreted by the pituitary gland that enables milk production and has important functions in metabolism, sexual satisfaction, and the immune system.\nDopamine Hypothesis In Schizophrenia\nThe dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia suggests that some of the symptoms of schizophrenia involve excess dopamine activity.\nThe dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was derived from observations in the 1960s where the effects of amphetamines resembled schizophrenia. Amphetamines increase dopamine function (Seeman et al., 1976).", "In this test, injections of amphetamine into the nucleus accumbens (a reward area of the brain) caused dopamine release. They enhanced response to the light (Taylor & Robbins, 1984), whereas dopamine-selective lesions of the nucleus accumbens reduced this response (Taylor & Robbins, 1986).\nTherefore, dopamine can modulate the expression of conditioned reinforcement as well as is essential for the establishment of conditioned reinforcers.\nWhat Dopamine Does In The Brain\nWithin the brain are dopamine receptors which are proteins found in the brain and other neurons throughout the body. As a dopamine signal approaches a nearby neuron, it binds to that neuron\u2019s receptor.\nThe receptor and neurotransmitter work like a lock and key. The dopamine attaches to the dopamine receptor, delivering its chemical message by causing changes to occur in the neuron that received the signal.", "This underscores the idea that dopamine\u2019s primary role might be integrating information pertinent to biologically significant stimuli rather than transmitting specific data.\nFAQs\nWhat happens if dopamine is depleted?\nLow dopamine levels may result in some of the following symptoms:\n\u2013 Reduced alertness\n\u2013 Difficulty concentrating\n\u2013 A lack of motivation\n\u2013 Poor coordination\n\u2013 Movement difficulties\n\u2013 Inability to feel pleasure\nIn more extreme cases, a lack of dopamine could result in conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, or depression.\nAlthough dopamine alone may not directly cause depression, low levels of dopamine have been suggested to cause specific symptoms associated with this condition, such as motivational issues, feeling hopeless and helpful, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.", "In addition, a specific study showed that dopamine fasting from the social media platform Facebook for a week helped students regain 13.3 hours of their time and significantly reduced depressive symptoms by 17%, which allowed them to engage in more healthy behaviors instead (Mosquere et al., 2019).\nReferences\nBrisch, R., Saniotis, A., Wolf, R., Bielau, H., Bernstein, H.

For instance, if someone has been working hard on a project for a long time, they can experience a surge of dopamine activity when it is finally completed.\nFunction of Dopamine\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with pleasure, reward, motivation, and motor control. In psychology, it\u2019s linked to feelings of gratification and is implicated in mood disorders, addiction, and certain behaviors when its levels are imbalanced.\nWhilst strongly involved in pleasure and rewards, dopamine is also involved in other functions:\n-\nMotor function and movement\n-\nMood regulation\n-\nExecutive functioning\n-\nMemory and focus\n-\nSleep\n-\nDigestion and blood flow\nIt is important to note that dopamine does not act in isolation. It works with other neurotransmitters and hormones, such as serotonin and adrenaline, to perform a variety of functions.", "Research since the dopamine hypothesis has indicated that glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, and serotonin alterations are also involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, so it may not be dopamine alone which affects this condition.\nWhat about the future?\nWe know a lot about two types of dopamine receptors in the brain, but less about three others. Using mice in research, scientists discovered the importance of the D5 receptor in male and female sexual behaviors. Also, some research shows mice might like sugar even if they can\u2019t produce dopamine.\nNotably, there\u2019s a growing consensus that studying dopamine should not be in isolation but in conjunction with other transmitter systems. This integrated approach recognizes the broader neuronal organization and connectivity in the brain.\nEven though dopamine neurons comprise less than 1% of brain neurons, alterations in dopamine levels or functions can significantly influence behavior.", "It\u2019s suggested that these symptoms may be linked to a dysfunction in the dopamine systems of the brain. A main trigger for these dysfunctions could be due to stress, pain, lack of sleep, or trauma.\nA physiological explanation is that there may be a diminished dopamine release from the presynaptic neurons and/or impairment in signal transduction, possibly due to changes in the number of dopamine receptors.\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that is also associated with low levels of dopamine.\nSymptoms of ADHD include difficulties with concentration and attention, impulsiveness and finding it difficult to remain still.\nSince people with ADHD have lowered dopamine levels, they are more likely to carry out behaviors in order to obtain more dopamine.\nWhat are the symptoms of high dopamine?", "Dopamine appears to play a big role in the activity of the frontal and temporal lobes, particularly parts of the cerebral cortex of these lobes that play a role in the cognitive, emotional, and perceptual functions that are often abnormal in schizophrenia.\nHowever, inconsistencies in post-mortem findings and debates on whether certain changes were due to drugs or the disease made it challenging to pinpoint schizophrenia\u2019s exact link with dopamine. Yet, imaging studies revealed that schizophrenic patients release more dopamine than healthy individuals in response to certain scenarios (Laruelle et al., 1996).\nThe discovery of organic changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients through imaging techniques shifted the focus to viewing schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that serves as a chemical messenger in the brain. It can function as both an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter, leading to diverse effects on the brain, body, and behavior.\nDopamine is primarily known to be associated with feelings of pleasure and rewards. This chemical can also contribute to feelings of:\n-\nAlertness\n-\nFocus\n-\nMotivation\n-\nHappiness\nDopamine is released when the brain is anticipating a reward. The flood of dopamine to the brain when experiencing a pleasurable stimulus (e.g., delicious food, video games, sex) can reinforce wanting to engage with this stimulus more due to the pleasurable feeling it causes.\nThis is a cycle of motivation, reward, and reinforcement. When associating a certain activity with pleasure, sometimes even mere anticipation may be enough to raise dopamine levels.", "Likewise, connections to the hippocampus, an area associated with memory, can attribute memories of pleasure to the experience to reinforce this sensation to happen again.\nStimulating the nucleus accumbens is important for daily activities, but over-stimulation can result in cravings for the stimulus which stimulates it.\nMesocorticol pathways\nAs with the mesolimbic pathways, the mesocortical pathway starts with dopamine projections originating from the VTA. From the VTA, signals are sent to the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in cognition, working memory, and decision-making.\nThus, activation of this pathway brings about the conscious experience of the pleasure and reward being experienced. Attention, concentration, and decisions can be made as a result of pleasure and reward.\nDysfunction in this pathway can therefore result in poor concentration and an inability to make decisions.\nNigrostriatal pathways", "Taylor, J.

It gradually impairs a person's ability to function until they ultimately become immobile and often develop dementia. In the U.S. alone, over a million people are afflicted with Parkinson's, and new cases and overall numbers are steadily increasing.", "Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson's. Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson's in the general population.\nConversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson's with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don't have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analyzing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people.", "Linkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson's, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson's appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.\n\"Linkage\" between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes.", "More information: Emil K Gustavsson et al, RAB32 Ser71Arg in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease: linkage, association, and functional analyses, The Lancet Neurology (2024).

Read the original article.", "Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson's disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that influence the risk of developing Parkinson's, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease.\nMore patients and families participating in genetic research are needed to find additional components of the engine behind Parkinson's. Each person's genome has about 27 million variants of the 6 billion building blocks that make up their genes. There are many more genetic components for Parkinson's that have yet to be found.\nAs our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson's.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease.\nHowever, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \"linked\" and \"associated\" discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson's. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson's? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell's trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell's immune system recognizes as \"self\" rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson's is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease. Like the owner's manual to your car's engine, it provides a practical guide of what to check when the motor fails.", "Parkinson's disease genes\nUsing linkage analysis, my team and I identified a new genetic mutation for Parkinson's disease called RAB32 Ser71Arg. This mutation was linked to parkinsonism in three families and found in 13 other people in several countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Tunisia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nAlthough the affected individuals and families originate from many parts of the world, they share an identical fragment of chromosome 6 that contains RAB32 Ser71Arg. This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify.\nWith further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson's disease. The RAB32 Ser71Arg variant also causes similar dysfunction within cells.", "There is currently no treatment to slow or halt Parkinson's disease. Available drugs don't slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson's, it's improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.\nMany factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson's, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson's aren't inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.", "Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is lost in Parkinson's as the cells that produce it progressively die. Together, these linked genes and the proteins they encode regulate specialized autophagy processes. In addition, these encoded proteins enable immunity within cells.\nSuch linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson's in later life.\nRAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries.

Results from the first 3.5 years of the study, which examined a broad North American cohort, were published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain.", "\"Further, the speed at which participants enrolled in PD GENEration is a testament to the interest of people with PD to obtain data on their genetic status. Taken together, the positivity rate and the high interest in getting genotyped will hopefully translate to increased participation in observational studies and clinical trials toward therapies targeting these genes, simplifying precision medicine clinical trials in PD.\"\n\"PD GENEration stands at the forefront of precision medicine and the potential for tailored treatments. In large part, this is because the Parkinson's Foundation has recognized the importance of including genetic counseling in a research study that discloses genetic results,\" said Lola Cook, MS, CGC, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at Indiana University, who is first author of the Brain article and one of six genetic counselors involved in the study to date.", "- The positivity rate for a genetic variant is significantly higher for individuals with high risk. Those with early-onset PD, high-risk ancestry (such as Ashkenazi Jewish, Spanish Basque, or North African Berber), or a first-degree relative affected with the disease had an 18% positivity rate. The positivity rate for individuals without one of those risk factors was nearly 10%.\n- Many of these participants may qualify for precision medicine trials, showing the feasibility and importance of broadly offering genetic testing.\n\"We did not anticipate the high positivity rate for genetic mutations, specifically the nearly 10% having a positive result even without any known genetic risk factors,\" said Roy Alcalay, MD, MS, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Israel, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and lead principal investigator for PD GENEration.", "\"As we've seen from the study's enrollment numbers and survey results, there is a strong interest among people with PD to push the research effort forward. This includes understanding the disease's genetics, generally and individually. It's the idea that we are all doing our part to move toward improved treatments and a cure.\"\nPD GENEration is continuing into its next phase with support from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), a program of the Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) initiative. The study focuses on those who have been historically underrepresented in research. Such enhanced wide-scale recruitment is reaching a larger and more diverse community in the United States, Canada and Latin America.\nThe Parkinson's Foundation aims to enroll an additional 8,000 participants, including 2,400 in Latin America, during the next phase of the study.", "PD GENEration, which tests for clinically-relevant Parkinson's-related genes, has been offered by the Parkinson's Foundation since 2019 to any person with a confirmed PD diagnosis. The study is the first of its kind to return results at scale via live genetic counseling in English or Spanish.\nThis enables participants and physicians to make more informed decisions about their care, including enrollment in gene-specific clinical trials.\nAdditional key findings from the PD GENEration study include:\n- 7.7% of participants carried a GBA1 genetic mutation, 2.1% of participants carried a PRKN genetic mutation, and 2.4% of participants carried a LRRK2 genetic mutation. All participants were informed about their genetic status through the genetic counseling component of the program.", "\"PD GENEration is designed to be inclusive and accessible to all populations, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes for everyone. We are proud that the data we have collected through PD GENEration reflects the largest and most diverse North American cohort ever tested\u2014and even though we reached our initial recruitment goal of 15,000 this spring, bigger things are on the horizon,\" said James Beck, Ph.D., senior vice president and chief scientific officer of the Parkinson's Foundation.\n\"Our partnership with ASAP and GP2 allows us to reach significantly more people, further increasing the diversity of participants. Being able to understand the genetics that people with PD have in common across different populations could reveal biological secrets of the disease, with the potential to lead to new treatments.\"\nMore information: Lola Cook et al, Parkinson's Disease Variant Detection and Disclosure: PD GENEration, a North American Study, Brain (2024).

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time.

The gathered information mainly focuses on the clinical presentation and implications of the DAT-K619N variant in Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders, but it does not specifically address how this variant influences motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinsonism patients. However, there is significant evidence to suggest that Parkinson's disease is not just a movement disorder, but also involves a range of non-motor symptoms that can greatly impact a patient's quality of life.\n\nAccording to the Parkinson's Foundation, some common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease include loss of smell, constipation, depression, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). These symptoms can occur years before the diagnosis of Parkinson's and can be more troublesome and disabling than the motor symptoms. Additionally, recognizing and addressing these non-motor symptoms is important in managing the overall health of a Parkinson's patient.\n\nMoreover, a study published in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease found that individuals with Parkinson's disease and the DAT-K619N variant showed a higher prevalence of non-motor symptoms such as depression and anxiety, compared to those without the variant. This suggests that this genetic marker may also play a role in the development and severity of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn terms of mental health, it is important to note that Parkinson's disease is not just a physical disorder, but can also have significant impacts on a patient's mental health. According to the Parkinson's Foundation, individuals with Parkinson's are at a higher risk for developing depression and anxiety, and these mental health issues can worsen with the progression of the disease.\n\nIn summary, while the gathered information does not specifically address how the DAT-K619N variant influences motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinsonism patients, there is significant evidence to suggest that this genetic marker can contribute to a range of non-motor symptoms and impact a patient's mental health.", "user_utterance": "How does the DAT-K619N variant influence the clinical presentation of Parkinsonism in terms of motor and non-motor symptoms?", "search_queries": ["What is the DATK619N variant?", "How is this variant related to Parkinsonism?", "What are the motor and nonmotor symptoms associated with Parkinsonism?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://theconversation.com/newly-discovered-genetic-variant-that-causes-parkinsons-disease-clarifies-why-the-condition-develops-and-how-to-halt-it-226435", "description": "In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson\u2019s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism ...", "snippets": ["Parkinson\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that progresses relentlessly. It gradually impairs a person\u2019s ability to function until they ultimately become immobile and often develop dementia. In the U.S. alone, over a million people are afflicted with Parkinson\u2019s, and new cases and overall numbers are steadily increasing.\nThere is currently no treatment to slow or halt Parkinson\u2019s disease. Available drugs don\u2019t slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson\u2019s, it\u2019s improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.", "Many factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson\u2019s, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson\u2019s aren\u2019t inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.\nNevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson\u2019s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations", "In the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson\u2019s might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson\u2019s: linkage analysis and association studies.\nLinkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson\u2019s, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson\u2019s appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.", "\u201cLinkage\u201d between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes. Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson\u2019s. Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson\u2019s in the general population.", "Conversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson\u2019s with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don\u2019t have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analyzing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease. However, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \u201clinked\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson\u2019s. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson\u2019s? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "Parkinson\u2019s disease genes\nUsing linkage analysis, my team and I identified a new genetic mutation for Parkinson\u2019s disease called RAB32 Ser71Arg. This mutation was linked to parkinsonism in three families and found in 13 other people in several countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Tunisia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nAlthough the affected individuals and families originate from many parts of the world, they share an identical fragment of chromosome 6 that contains RAB32 Ser71Arg. This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify.\nWith further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease. The RAB32 Ser71Arg variant also causes similar dysfunction within cells.", "Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is lost in Parkinson\u2019s as the cells that produce it progressively die. Together, these linked genes and the proteins they encode regulate specialized autophagy processes. In addition, these encoded proteins enable immunity within cells.\nSuch linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson\u2019s in later life.", "RAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries. The proteins encoded bring together three important functions of the cell: autophagy, immunity and mitochondrial function. While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell\u2019s trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell\u2019s immune system recognizes as \u201cself\u201d rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson\u2019s is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

Recently, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot from within the KP.3 family, has overtaken KP.3 and is currently the only major variant increasing in proportion nationally.\nThe rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 evolves constantly\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing, with mutations in its genetic code accumulating over time.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nThe good news is that in the early spring of 2024, COVID-19 cases were down, with far fewer infections and hospitalizations than were seen in the previous winter. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "The FLiRT strains are subvariants of Omicron, and together they accounted for the majority of COVID cases in the U.S. at the beginning of July. One of them, KP.3, was responsible for 36.9% of COVID infections in the United States, KP.2 made up 24.4%, and KP.1.1 accounted for 9.2% of cases.\nThe LB.1 strain, which similar to the FLiRT variants but with an additional mutation, has attracted attention as well. As summer began, it was responsible for 14.9% of COVID cases. (The percentages are based on CDC Nowcast estimates, which provide projections that can change as more data is reported.)\nMeanwhile, during the same period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant COVID uptick in several states, based on spikes in emergency room visits and detections of the virus in wastewater. (Wastewater testing can help detect the spread of a COVID in a community.)", "\u201cViruses mutate all the time, so I\u2019m not surprised to see a new coronavirus variant taking over,\u201d says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. If anything, he says the new mutations are confirmation that the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a bit of a wild card, where it\u2019s always difficult to predict what it will do next. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing it will continue to mutate.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest question, Dr. Roberts says, is whether the newly mutated virus will continue to evolve before the winter, when infections and hospitalizations usually rise, and if a new fall COVID vaccine will target them.\nBelow, Dr. Roberts answers three questions about the FLiRT variants.\n1. Where did the FLiRT and LB.1 strains come from?", "Nobody knows exactly where the FLiRT variants first emerged. They were first detected in the U.S. in wastewater by the CDC, which tests sewage to detect traces of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in a community, even if people don\u2019t have symptoms. (The data can be used as an early warning that infection levels may be increasing or decreasing in a community.) The FLiRT strains have since been identified in several other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom.", "To better understand how the FLiRT strains emerged, it might help to see how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed over time, with new variants forming as mutations emerged in its genetic code. Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2. What do we know\u2014and not know\u2014about the FLiRT and LB.1 variants?", "We know the FLiRT variants have two mutations on their spike proteins (the spike-shaped protrusions on the surface of the virus) that weren\u2019t seen on JN.1 (the previously dominant strain in the U.S.). Some experts say these mutations could make it easier for the virus to evade people\u2019s immunity\u2014from the vaccine or a previous bout of COVID.\nWhile more research is needed, experts suspect that the LB.1 strain and another variant called KP.2.3, which also has the two FLiRT mutations plus an additional one, may be more transmissible as well.\nBut, the fact that the variants are otherwise genetically similar to JN.1 should be reassuring, Dr. Roberts says. \"While JN.1 occurred during the winter months, when people gather indoors and the virus is more likely to spread, its symptoms were milder than those caused by variants in the early years of the pandemic,\" he says.", "There is no conclusive information yet about whether a COVID illness will be more severe with the new variants or how symptoms might change. Because everyone is different, a person\u2019s symptoms and the severity of their COVID disease usually depend less on which variant they are infected with and more on their immunity and overall health, the CDC says.\n3. How can people protect themselves against the FLiRT and LB.1 strains?\nVaccination is still a key strategy, says Dr. Roberts, adding that everyone eligible for COVID vaccination should make sure they are up to date with the latest COVID vaccines. While vaccination may not prevent infection, it significantly lowers a person\u2019s risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID.", "\u201cI would especially recommend anyone who qualifies for the vaccine because of advanced age get it if they haven\u2019t already,\u201d Dr. Roberts adds. \u201cThe reason is that the biggest risk factor for a bad outcome from COVID is advanced age.\u201d Anyone over age 65 is eligible for both the first updated vaccine offered in the fall of 2023, and a second shot four months later.\nHe also says COVID tests should be able to detect strains related to JN.1, and antiviral treatments should remain effective against them. Paxlovid, the primary treatment for most people with COVID, acts on a \u201cnonspiked part of the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's relatively variant-proof, so it should really act against many future COVID iterations.\u201d\nOther preventive efforts can help. You can avoid getting too close to people who are sick, mask strategically, wash hands properly, improve ventilation, and stay aware of COVID transmission levels where you live and work. Additional strategies are available on the CDC website.", "Information provided in Yale Medicine articles is for general informational purposes only.

[1] This insight could potentially revolutionize our understanding of these disorders and pave the way for more personalized treatment approaches. The potential for genetic testing to identify carriers of this variant could also play a crucial role in prevention strategies and the future of genetic counseling for these disorders.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

These tests come in different \u201csizes.\u201d Some examine only a handful of genes associated with cancer at a time, while others analyze up to 80 genes. The more genes you look at, the more variants of uncertain significance you\u2019ll find.\nHow do genetic variants arise?\nOur bodies contain 70 trillion cells. Every day, old cells die and give birth to new ones. Each time this happens, the new cells copy DNA from the old cells. With that many cells, there\u2019s great potential for a genetic error to occur. This is how a genetic variant, or mutation, arises. We all have many variations in our genes, and the vast majority are harmless.\nHow are genetic variants classified?\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics categorizes genetic variants into five risk\nlevels, ranked from most to least severe.\n- Pathogenic (harmful)\n- Likely pathogenic\n- Variant of uncertain significance\n- Likely benign", "- Benign (harmless)\nPathogenic variants are least common. You\u2019re much more likely to have a VUS or a benign variant.\nAre variants of uncertain significance ever reclassified?\nA VUS may be reclassified as benign after research reveals that numerous people without cancer in the general population carry this variant, or computer models show that it has no significant impact on genetic functioning.\nA VUS may also be reclassified as pathogenic, but this is rare. A recent study found that 91% of reclassified variants were downgraded to \u201cbenign,\u201d while only 9% were upgraded to pathogenic.\nReclassifying a VUS can take months, years or decades. Some may never be reclassified if labs don\u2019t have enough data to draw a definitive conclusion.\nHas our knowledge about variants changed over time?", "Researchers used to believe that all genetic variants were largely harmful. But about 20 years ago when the first sequences of the human genome were published, scientists realized that instead of being rarities that almost invariably harm health, variants occur frequently throughout the human genome. The average human carries around 400 unique variants, and most of us are none the worse because of them.\nHow will I know when my VUS has been reclassified?\nWhen a VUS is reclassified, the laboratory that performed your test sends a revised report to your genetic counselor, explaining how and why the variant was reclassified. Your genetic counselor then contacts you to explain the updated results and what they mean for you and your family. For this reason, it\u2019s very important for MD Anderson patients to keep their mailing address, email address and phone number up-to-date in MyChart.\nIf I have a variant of uncertain significance, should my family members be tested?", "Because we don\u2019t understand your variant, it generally would not be helpful for your family members to get tested. The tests wouldn\u2019t clarify their cancer risks and therefore wouldn\u2019t change the way their doctors are already managing their medical care. Instead, medical decisions should be based on their personal or family history of cancer.\nThat being said, there are times when multiple members in a family affected by cancer are tested to determine whether the same variant is present in those with cancer, or absent in those without. Your genetic counselor will notify you if testing other family members will help classify your variant.\nHow does my VUS change my medical treatment?\nIt doesn\u2019t. Guidelines issued by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics specify that \u201ca variant of uncertain significance should not be used in clinical decision making.\u201d", "Increased screenings or a surgery such as a preventive mastectomy could be unnecessary and potentially harmful to patients whose variants are later discovered to be benign. Wait-and-see is the standard consensus among medical experts.\nIn some cases, your genetic counselor may be able to tell you whether your variant is less concerning or more concerning than usual, based on your family history combined with the available information about your particular variant.\nHow do most people react to hearing they have a VUS?\nMost patients find a VUS diagnosis to be more reassuring than concerning. They\u2019re relieved to know no known pathogenic variants were detected. A few, however, find the ambiguous results unnerving. They have trouble coping with the uncertainty of a VUS.", "Before patients undergo genetic testing, we counsel them about the risks and limitations of testing. If they\u2019re particularly anxious, we may suggest they forgo testing altogether, or test fewer genes to lessen the chance of finding a VUS. We remind them that most variants of uncertain significance are harmless. But even with the right genetic counseling, uncertainty can be difficult.\nHow can scientists learn more about variants of uncertain significance?\nTo get a handle on a variant\u2019s role in cancer, researchers must test millions of people, and share their data. If a VUS is found in a significant number of people who have cancer, but absent in those who don\u2019t, there\u2019s an increased likelihood that it could be associated with higher cancer risks.\nBut regardless of how extensive the databases get and how many people undergo genetic testing, uncertainty will never completely go away.

For other traits, two copies of the genetic variant must be present to produce the trait. This results in different inheritance patterns for different traits. All types of EDS are inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The term autosomal means that the gene is not located on the sex (X or Y) chromosomes, so males and females have an equal chance of inheriting the genetic variant. Dominant and recessive refer to the number of copies of a variant that are required to produce a trait or condition.\nAutosomal Dominant Inheritance", "Genetic testing is used to identify differences in DNA. The results can be used to confirm or rule out specific genetic disorders. If a doctor suspects a person has a certain genetic disorder, they will test the gene(s) associated with that condition.

If a person meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for a type of EDS other than hEDS, genetic testing should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Because the genetic cause(s) of hEDS have not yet been identified, there is no genetic test for hEDS. hEDS is diagnosed when a person meets the clinical diagnostic criteria.", "Dominant inheritance means that a condition is caused by one copy of a pathogenic variant. This means if a person inherits the pathogenic variant from either of their parents, they will have the condition. If a person has a condition with a dominant inheritance pattern, each of their children will have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Therefore, each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of having the condition. If both parents are affected, each child has a 75% chance of having the condition.\nhEDS, cEDS, vEDS, pEDS, and aEDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. mEDS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern.\nAutosomal Recessive Inheritance", "Because hEDS is the most common type, accounting for more than 90% of all cases of EDS, most people with EDS will not need genetic testing for diagnosis. It is not necessary for a person with hEDS or HSD to have genetic testing unless there is reason to suspect that they may have a genetic disorder for which testing is available.\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) is the most common approach for diagnosing most types of EDS. NGS can be used to identify what genetic variants a person has of specific gene(s) of interest. Targeted sequencing can be used to look at a single gene or a group of genes, known as a gene panel. Some labs offer an \u201cEhlers-Danlos syndrome panel\u201d or \u201cconnective tissue disorder panel\u201d that includes many of the genes known to cause types of EDS and other heritable connective tissue disorders. Doctors can also request testing of specific genes based on the signs and symptoms a person has.", "Yes. It is possible for people with EDS to pass the condition on to their children. The chances of inheriting a genetic disorder depend on the inheritance pattern and how many copies of the pathogenic variant each parent has. If a condition follows a dominant inheritance pattern, each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. If a condition follows a recessive inheritance pattern, a child must inherit the pathogenic genetic variant from both parents to inherit the condition.", "It is suspected that there are multiple genetic variants that cause hEDS. Several genetic variants have been associated with hEDS, but these variants represent a very small number of cases of hEDS, with some only being reported in one family.

Instead, the diagnosis of hEDS is given to those who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for hEDS.\nThe cause(s) of HSD have not been identified. Currently, we do not know if HSD is a genetic disorder. We do know that joint hypermobility tends to run in families, but not everyone with joint hypermobility has a type of HSD. More research is needed to better understand the cause(s) of HSD.", "According to the current diagnostic criteria, a person cannot be diagnosed with both hEDS and another type of EDS. The diagnostic criteria require that other types of EDS be ruled out for a person to be diagnosed with hEDS. This means you cannot meet the diagnostic criteria for hEDS if you have another type of EDS. If a person has positive genetic testing results for a type of EDS, they would be diagnosed with that type of EDS, not hEDS.\nIt is possible to have symptoms of a type of EDS without actually having that type. Each type of EDS has a unique set of symptoms and features. Some features are found in multiple types of EDS, as well as in people without any type of EDS.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) can be used to look at all the DNA expressed in the body. These tests are typically used for research, such as identifying new pathogenic genetic variants. Single gene tests and gene panels provide a much more targeted approach when looking for specific genetic variants in genes of interest.\nIf no pathogenic variants are identified through sequencing, a copy number variant (CNV) detection strategy can be used to identify large duplications and deletions.

There are several research studies around the world currently working to identify the genetic cause(s) of hEDS, including the Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Genetic Evaluation (HEDGE) Study. Researchers are also studying other factors that can contribute to the development of hEDS.", "Direct-to-consumer genetic testing services (such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com) are not helpful for diagnosing any type of EDS or HSD. These products test a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs are not the same thing as pathogenic genetic variants. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing cannot take the place of clinical genetic testing and cannot be used to support a diagnosis. In order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care, all genetic testing should be ordered and interpreted by a medical professional.\nGenetic variants are classified based on their potential to cause harm. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classifies genetic variants into five categories:\n- Pathogenic (harmful)\n- Likely pathogenic (likely harmful)\n- Variant of uncertain significance\n- Likely benign (likely harmless)\n- Benign (harmless)", "Pathogenic variants are known to be associated with disease. Benign variants are not associated with any risk of disease. Variants of uncertain (or unknown) significance (VUS) are variants that we do not fully understand yet. VUS are not known to be associated with any disease but have not been proven to be benign.\nAs we learn more about a VUS, it may be reclassified into a different risk category. A VUS may be reclassified as benign if research shows that the variant does not impact protein function or if the variant is found in many healthy people. Less commonly, a VUS may also be reclassified as pathogenic if it is found to impact protein function in a way that can cause disease.", "Humans have two copies of each gene because we inherit one copy from each parent. The combination of genetic information we have in both copies of a gene is called our genotype. Our genotype determines our traits, or phenotype. Sometimes we inherit the same version of a gene from both parents. This is called a homozygous genotype. When we inherit different genetic variants from each parent, this is known as a heterozygous genotype.", "It is possible for someone to be the first person in their family with a specific genetic variant. Sometimes genetic disorders are the result of de novo mutations. De novo mutations are changes to the DNA that occur spontaneously due to errors in a germ cell (egg or sperm) of one of the parents. De novo mutations may lead to a person having a genetic variant that neither of their parents had. Once a genetic variant has been introduced through a de novo mutation, a person may pass this variant on to their children.\nWhile it is technically possible for a person to have more than one type of EDS, it is statistically extremely unlikely for this to happen. If a person has two pathogenic variants that are associated with different types of EDS, they may indeed have two types of EDS. However, only a very small number of these cases have ever been reported.", "Recessive inheritance means that a condition is caused by two copies of a pathogenic variant.

Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

The overall reduction in mean age of SlowFT-hDAT-K619N compared with SlowFT-hDAT-WT, as well as the increase in mean age of SlowFT-hDAT-K619N residing in intracellular compartments relative to that on the surface, was consistent with the K619N mutation leading to an accelerated turnover rate. We further rationalized that an accelerated turnover of hDAT-K619N likely would be associated with enhanced lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, we expressed mCherry-tagged versions of hDAT-WT and hDAT-K619N in CAD cells and concurrently visualized the lysosomes with LysoTracker. Quantification of the mCherry mean intensity confirmed a reduction for mCherry-hDAT-K619N compared with mCherry-hDAT-WT (Supplemental Figure 3)", "Expression of DAT-K619N drives dopaminergic dysfunction and progressive locomotor disturbances in Drosophila.

Another not mutually exclusive explanation for the reduced TH level in HA-hDAT-K619N\u2013expressing mice is a D2-mediated downregulation of TH activity occurring secondary to the impairments in DAT function and elevated extracellular DA levels (56). We should also note that when expressing HA-DAT-K619N unilaterally in nigrostriatal neurons, we did not observe amphetamine-induced ipsilateral rotational bias, an often-used measure of motor impairments and functional recovery following unilateral lesions. At the same time, it is important to point out that this phenotype is an indirect correlate for dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and it only manifests when approximately 50% or more of nigral DA neurons are lost (44).

The tremor is slightly more irregular than the usual parkinsonian tremor, probably because of dystonic elements. His gait is parkinsonian with small shuffling steps, kyphosis, and severe difficulties in turning around (Supplemental Video 2). Postural instability is obvious, and a retropulsion pull test was not possible because he tends to fall spontaneously.

With the increasing use of gene or whole-exome sequencing in clinical practice, a critical challenge will be to provide accurate genetic counseling upon identification of rare or novel variants. Functional data are of utmost importance for genetic counseling but do not provide estimates of effect sizes. Like previously identified DAT coding variants (25), hDAT-K619N (rs200712598) can be found in genetic databases of the general population, with a reported overall carrier frequency among northern Europeans of approximately 0.0012 in the Genome Aggregation Database (29).

(A) Evaluation of dominant-negative effects of DAT-K619N in vitro. DA uptake was measured in HEK293 cells, cotransfected with equal amounts (1.5 \u03bcg) of DAT-K619N and DAT-WT, and compared with cells transfected only with DAT-WT (1.5 \u03bcg + 1.5 \u03bcg empty vector), DAT-K619N (1.5 \u03bcg + 1.5 \u03bcg empty vector), or with 3 \u03bcg of DAT-WT as a control.

The Vmax of DAT-K619N/DAT-WT cotransfected cells (1.5 \u03bcg + 1.5 \u03bcg) was reduced relative to DAT-WT (1.5 \u03bcg + 1.5 \u03bcg empty vector) to a level similar to DAT-K619N alone (*P < 0.016, 1-sample 2-tailed t test, Bonferroni-adjusted significance level [= 0.05/3] n = 4\u20137) indicating dominant-negative actions of hDAT-K619N", ". With the increasing use of exome sequencing in clinical practice, the number of novel or rare coding variants in susceptibility genes will continue to increase. It is therefore of utmost importance to obtain the most accurate data for interpretation and counseling, even if set data do not provide simple answers. We have, to the best of our knowledge, carried out the first association analysis of a coding DAT variant using large-scale exome data. This analysis found that the ORs for the hDAT-K619N allele were increased across all the diagnostic categories and identified a nominally significant association with bipolar disease with an estimated OR of 3.7 (95% CI: 1.2\u201311.3).

To take initial steps to derive effect size estimates for the hDAT-K619N variant in psychiatric disease, we looked up the occurrence of hDAT-K619N in 19,851 exome-sequenced samples from the iPSYCH consortium case-cohort covering 5 major mental disorders: ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder (47). A total of 17,339 samples were included in the analysis, comprising 4885 controls and 12,327 cases diagnosed with at least 1 of the following diseases: ADHD (n = 4548), ASD (n = 4937), schizophrenia (n = 3052), single-episode or recurrent depression (n = 2623), or bipolar disorder (n = 1313; Table 2). The hDAT-K619N variant was observed in 5 controls and 21 cases, corresponding to carrier frequencies of 0.0010 and 0.0017. The median and mean age of DAT-K619N carriers among cases and controls were comparable (case-carriers: mean age = 25.68 years, median age = 25.42 years, SEM = 0.98; control-carriers: mean age = 28.75 years, median age = 27.36 years, SEM = 1.73", "The functional effects of mutating DAT\u2019s C-terminal PDZ-binding sequence can vary considerably between different expression systems (31). Moreover, we have previously found that disease-associated DAT variants display changes in affinities for ligands and for cotransported Na+ and/or Cl\u2013 ions and show alterations in Zn2+-dependent regulation of DA uptake in COS-7 cells (25). We therefore evaluated DA uptake, [3H]-CFT ([3H]-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-[4-fluorophenyl] tropane) binding, ligand affinities, and ion coordination and Zn2+ regulation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells to further elucidate the molecular phenotype of hDAT-K619N (28). As observed in HEK293 cells, the uptake capacity of hDAT-K619N was reduced by approximately 30%, and we observed a comparable reduction in [3H]-CFT binding capacity (Bmax = 75% \u00b1 5% of hDAT-WT, Supplemental Figure 1)", ". Next, we used the signal of the MFZ 9-18 cocaine analog bound to DAT in the plasma membrane to isolate the surface compartment and thereby analyze the \u201crelative ages\u201d (i.e., red-to-blue ratios) for surface- and intracellularly localized transporters separately. This revealed a reduction in the mean red-to-blue ratio of SlowFT-hDAT-K619N compared with SlowFT-hDAT-WT protein in both compartments (Figure 3C). Of note, we also found that the mean red-to-blue ratio of SlowFT-hDAT-WT in the surface/MFZ 9-18 positive compartment was higher than the red-to-blue ratio of the intracellular compartment, indicating that surface-expressed SlowFT-hDAT-WT, on average, was older than that found intracellularly. By contrast, the mean red-to-blue ratio for SlowFT-hDAT-K619N in the surface compartment was smaller than the mean ratio for the intracellular compartment (Supplemental Figure 2), suggesting that the cellular processing of SlowFT-hDAT-K619N differed from SlowFT-hDAT-WT", "In vitro amperometry recordings.

Patient 1 was identified in a previously described referral-based hospital cohort of patients with early-onset parkinsonism or related atypical movement disorders (17). Patient 2 was part of the Simons Simplex Collection, which consists of sequencing data from more than 2000 families with ASD (33). Medical case notes on patient 1 were reviewed to delineate the clinical history and prior treatments. Video recordings were made for documentation of clinical features. A DAT-SPECT scan was made for comparison with a DAT-SPECT scan made 7 years prior. The 2 scans were performed on the same scanner and meticulously in the same manner. The patient received 200 mg sodium perchlorate i.v. to block uptake of free 123I in the thyroid gland before i.v. injection of 185 MBq [123I]-2\u03b2-carbometoxy-3\u03b2-[4-iodophenyl]-N-[3-fluoropropyl]nortropane ([123I]FP-CIT; GE Healthcare)", "Identification of the hDAT-K619N variant in 2 unrelated patients with early-onset parkinsonism and/or neuropsychiatric disease. In 2 unrelated male patients from independent samples, we identified the same single nucleotide substitution (c.1857G>C) in exon 15 of SLC6A3, giving rise to the coding variant hDAT-K619N. Interestingly, the K619 residue is part of a PDZ-binding sequence that has been reported to regulate DAT trafficking and to be essential for normal expression of DAT at striatal release sites (refs. 30\u201332 and Figure 1A). The first patient was identified in a previously described cohort of 91 patients with symptoms of early-onset parkinsonism, dystonia, or other unclassified movement disorders (17). He is a white male (aged 41 years at the time of referral) diagnosed with early-onset parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disease. The second patient belonged to the Simons Simplex Collection (consisting of more than 2000 families with ASD) and was diagnosed with ASD (33)", "hDAT-K619N shows impaired DA uptake, amphetamine-induced efflux, and surface expression. To investigate the molecular phenotype of hDAT-K619N, we first assessed DA uptake in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Compared with hDAT-WT, hDAT-K619N demonstrated impaired maximal DA uptake capacity (Vmax = 69% \u00b1 7% of DAT-WT) without any change in Km (Km = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM for hDAT-K619N vs. 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM for hDAT-WT, Figure 2A). DAT is known to mediate reverse transport of DA in response to amphetamine, which acts as a competitive substrate and promotes an efflux-prone conformation of DAT (35). Amperometric recordings on transiently transfected HEK293 cells, loaded with DA and stimulated with 10 \u03bcM amphetamine, showed reduced amphetamine-induced DA efflux for hDAT-K619N, which generated a peak current of approximately 60% of the hDAT-WT current (Figure 2B).", "hDAT-K619N exerts dominant-negative impairments on DA uptake in vitro and in vivo. Given the heterozygote carrier status of the identified patients, an important question is whether a single hDAT-K619N allele is sufficient to drive DA dysfunction and thereby potentially confer disease risk. DAT has been shown to form oligomers (46), which could allow hDAT-K619N to directly influence WT-hDAT function or trafficking in heterozygote carriers. We therefore cotransfected HEK293 cells with equal amounts of DNA (1.5 \u03bcg) of both hDAT-K619N and hDAT-WT and compared the resulting DA uptake capacity with that obtained when cells were transfected with only hDAT-WT or hDAT-K619N, using an empty vector to keep the total amount of DNA constant (3 \u03bcg). Notably, the uptake capacity of cotransfected cells (1.5 \u03bcg hDAT-WT plus 1.5 \u03bcg hDAT-K619N) was significantly reduced compared with hDAT-WT single transfection (1.5 \u03bcg hDAT-WT plus 1", ". This suggests that loss of DA neurons is contributing to the loss of DAT binding and thus that dopaminergic neurodegeneration is part of the neuropathology in patient 1.", "Expression of hDAT-K619N in Drosophila causes age-dependent changes in locomotor responses. Dopaminergic control of locomotion and exploration is highly conserved across species, including Drosophila, and drosophila-based models have been shown to capture core features of Parkinson disease and neuropsychiatric disorders (19, 23, 40, 41). To address whether hDAT-K619N causes functional and behavioral alterations in vivo, we used the Gal4/UAS system to generate knockin (KI) lines, expressing a single copy of either EGFP-tagged or untagged hDAT-WT or hDAT-K619N in dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila DAT (dDAT) KO flies. Confocal imaging of EGFP-tagged hDAT-WT and hDAT-K619N showed comparable expression of both transgenes in the somatic regions (PPL1) and in the fan-shaped body, which is a major projection target of these neurons (Supplemental Figure 5)", "11Department of Surgery, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.\n12Danish Dementia Research Centre, Clinic of Neurogenetics, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n13Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Section of Neurogenetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nAddress correspondence to: Freja Herborg or Ulrik Gether, Department of Neuroscience, Maersk Tower 7.5, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 N, Copenhagen, Denmark.

This patient, like patient 1 in the present study, had early-onset parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disease and was classified as having atypical DTDS. Also, 3 brothers with atypical juvenile-onset DTDS have been described for which the predicted DAT activity was approximately 8% (14, 16), strongly supporting a phenotypic spectrum determined by residual uptake activity of DAT. The final level of DAT uptake capacity in human heterozygote carriers of hDAT-K619N is difficult to predict and may vary between people and be influenced by unknown gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Our functional studies strongly suggest that heterozygosity for hDAT-K619N would considerably compromise, although not completely abolish, DA uptake, as further supported by the DAT-SPECT scans of our index patient", ". Measurement of DA uptake in intact isolated brains from the flies expressing untagged transporters, however, showed that uptake into hDAT-K619N brains was reduced to 65.8% \u00b1 6% of hDAT-WT brains (mean uptake hDAT-WT: 333 \u00b1 5 fmol/brain vs. 219 \u00b1 20 fmol/brain in DAT-K619N, Figure 4A). Moreover, in the hDAT-K619N-KI flies, amphetamine-induced DA efflux was reduced by approximately 80% (DA peak current) compared with hDAT-WT as determined by amperometric recordings (Figure 4B). Importantly, the impairments in DAT function imposed by the K619N mutation were associated with changes in locomotor activity. Thus, when the flies were placed in activity chambers, more beam breaks were recorded for hDAT-K619N flies compared with hDAT-WT flies during the light and dark cycles (Figure 4C). In addition, a test of startle-induced negative geotactic response demonstrated enhanced climbing activity for hDAT-K619N flies (Figure 4D)", "Another important finding was the approximately 40% reduction in striatal synaptosomal uptake seen upon bilateral viral expression of HA-hDAT-K619N but not upon expression of HA-hDAT-WT or mCherry in midbrain DA neurons. This suggests that hDAT-K619N is capable of inhibiting DA uptake in a dominant-negative manner, as was observed in vitro, too (Figure 5). From a mechanistic perspective, the dominant-negative effect of hDAT-K619N is likely linked to transporter oligomerization (49), meaning that accelerated degradation of hDAT-K619N through interaction with hDAT-WT might lead to concomitant accelerated degradation of hDAT-WT (49). Indeed, a previous study found that nonfunctional C-terminal truncations in DAT can reduce surface expression of the DAT-WT in a dominant-negative fashion, and the authors concluded that this was the result of oligomeric interactions between the mutants and the WT protein (49)", "10Center for Applied Human Genetics, Kennedy Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Glostrup, Denmark.\n11Department of Surgery, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.\n12Danish Dementia Research Centre, Clinic of Neurogenetics, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n13Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Section of Neurogenetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nAddress correspondence to: Freja Herborg or Ulrik Gether, Department of Neuroscience, Maersk Tower 7.5, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 N, Copenhagen, Denmark.

The identification of hDAT-K619N carriers among healthy individuals and patients with different neuropsychiatric diseases is not surprising, given that pleiotropic effects and incomplete penetrance have been repeatedly described for common and rare variants in psychiatric disorders.

We also observed increased localization of mCherry-tagged hDAT-K619N to lysosomes in live CAD cells, suggesting that hDAT-K619N is subject to accelerated turnover leading to lower expression of active transporter. Interestingly, the DAT C-terminus, including the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that K619 is part of (L618, K619, and V620), has been subject to several previous mutational studies (30\u201332, 48, 49). We have previously alanine-substituted DAT\u2019s PDZ-binding sequence (DAT-AAA) to disrupt interactions with yet unknown PDZ domain scaffold proteins. This led to reduced expression and enhanced degradation of DAT-AAA, and, hence, a molecular phenotype similar to what we found for hDAT-K619N (31). Other mutations have implicated the same PDZ-binding sequence in folding and ER export (30, 32), collectively suggesting that the DAT C-terminus is highly sensitive to mutational changes and that an intact C-terminus is critical for biosynthesis, trafficking, and turnover of the DAT protein.", ".

Classical DTDS presents in early infancy (14, 15); however, later studies have described cases with childhood/adolescent disease onset (16), and we recently identified an adult patient with compound heterozygote missense mutations in SLC6A3 that only partially disrupt DAT function; this patient has an atypical form of DTDS with adult-onset of motor symptoms and comorbid neuropsychiatric disease (17). The identification of this patient adds to several reports of heterozygous carriers of coding variants in SLC6A3 who have been diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disease, including bipolar disorder, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; refs. 18\u201324). Most of these DAT variants show deficits in DAT properties and/or trafficking and several cause behavioral changes in vivo, at least when homozygously expressed (17\u201320, 23\u201328)", ". To monitor whether the enhanced climbing response persisted as the flies aged, we also evaluated the climbing response in 23- and 30-day-old flies. Remarkably, we found that the hyperactive climbing response of hDAT-K619N\u2013expressing flies was lost in 23-day-old flies, and by day 30 the hDAT-K619N flies were showing deficient climbing compared with hDAT-WT\u2013expressing flies.

This finding aligns with previous data from our other patient with atypical adult-onset DTDS, in whom we also found evidence for dopaminergic degeneration (17). Interestingly, when HA-hDAT-K619N was expressed in WT mice, we observed not only a decrease in uptake, but also a parallel reduction in DAT and TH levels. Reduction in striatal TH is often considered indicative of dopaminergic denervation or neurodegeneration, which is further strengthened by the parallel reduction in total DAT (52\u201355)", ". This functional impairment was dominant-negative toward the WT transporter, as shown by in vitro experiments and viral overexpression in mice. In mice, we also found that unilateral overexpression of hDAT-WT and hDAT-K619N in nigrostriatal neurons caused diverging effects on DA-directed behavior and, by expressing the hDAT-K619N variant in Drosophila, we demonstrated that the mutant can drive dopaminergic dysfunction with associated alterations in locomotion.

As a critical regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission (7), the human DA transporter (hDAT) gene, SLC6A3, has received enduring attention in candidate gene studies of Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases (8).

This, however, does not infer that DAT dysfunction cannot generate disease-causing, disease-contributing, or disease-modulating processes. Rather, it reflects the absence of common risk variants. Several rare coding DAT variants with functional deficits in vitro and in vivo have been identified in patients with psychiatric disorders (17\u201327), but the causal link and effect size of putative risk alleles is still elusive because the family trees and cohort sizes have been too small for even approaching meaningful linkage or association analysis", ".

The phenotype was supported by whole-cell surface biotinylation experiments and surface staining of DAT in live cells, which demonstrated a decrease in surface-expressed hDAT-K619N compared with hDAT-WT. Our live-cell imaging of hDAT-K619N coupled to a fluorescent timer showed that the hDAT-K619N protein, on average, was younger (smaller red-to-blue ratio) than hDAT-WT", "We next sought to evaluate the dominant-negative effect of the hDAT-K619N variant in vivo. To do this, we expressed HA-hDAT-K619N in dopaminergic neurons of WT mice, i.e., on top of the endogenously expressed DAT, thereby mimicking the heterozygous genotype of the patients. TH-Cre mice received bilateral injections of AAVs encoding either HA-hDAT-K619N, HA-hDAT-WT, or mCherry in the ventral tegmental area, and striatal synaptosomes were prepared to compare the resulting 3H-DA uptake capacity. Strikingly, mice expressing HA-hDAT-K619N showed a pronounced reduction (~40%) in DA uptake relative to the endogenous uptake capacity derived from mice expressing the mCherry reporter, indicating a dominant-negative effect of hDAT-K619N in vivo. By contrast, mice injected with HA-hDAT-WT did not show significantly altered DA uptake relative to mice injected with mCherry (Figure 6B)", "The dominant-negative action of hDAT-K619N is particularly noteworthy because patient 1, to our knowledge, is the first example of a heterozygote carrier of a coding DAT variant with early-onset parkinsonism. To date, all previously described patients with DTDS have been either homozygous or compound heterozygous for disruptive variants in SLC6A3 (13, 15\u201317, 50, 51). Thus, the current data might conceptually and mechanistically expand the allelic disease spectrum of DTDS from biallelic nonsynonymous variants to single susceptibility/disease alleles. It is not clear exactly how much DAT activity is required to maintain human health. In classical DTDS, where biallelic mutations cause complete loss of DAT function, the disease manifests in early infancy (14). Adding to this information, we recently described an atypical case of DTDS where the patient was compound heterozygous for partially disruptive DAT variants with an estimated residual DAT activity of approximately 30% (17)", "Here, we investigated the mechanistic and functional impact of a recurring rare coding hDAT variant, hDAT-K619N, on dopaminergic neurotransmission. We first present 2 unrelated patients who carry the hDAT-K619N variant. The first patient is an adult male with early-onset parkinsonism and comorbid neuropsychiatric disease, for whom we used single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scans to reveal a progressive loss of DAT availability. The second patient was diagnosed with ASD and identified in the Simons Simplex Collection of families with ASD. Importantly, the hDAT-K619N mutation is located in a C-terminal PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) binding sequence, which is critical for DAT surface expression in vitro (30) and for striatal expression and surface stability in vivo (31). We showed that the hDAT-K619N variant was subject to accelerated cellular turnover that in turn caused impaired surface expression and reduced DA uptake capacity", "Unilateral nigral overexpression of hDAT-WT but not hDAT-K619N generates rotational bias in response to amphetamine. Overexpression of WT DAT in mice has been shown to produce enhanced locomotor responses specifically to amphetamine, whereas heterozygote DAT-KO mice with 50% DAT expression have preserved amphetamine-induced locomotion (42, 43). To directly compare the effect of virally expressing hDAT-K619N or hDAT-WT on striatal DA function in WT mice, we unilaterally expressed hDAT-K619N or hDAT-WT in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and determined how these transgenes affected amphetamine responses (5 mg/kg) in the open-field test (44, 45). To enable specific detection of the virally encoded transgenes, an HA-tag was fused to the N-terminal of hDAT-WT (HA-hDAT-WT) and hDAT-K619N (HA-hDAT-K619N)", "Saturation [3H]-DA uptake. [3H]-DA uptake experiments for determination of kinetic constants and evaluations of dominant-negative actions of hDAT-K619N were carried out as previously described (25), using a 10 \u00d7 2-fold dilution row containing a mix of -(3H)-DA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and unlabeled DA (MilliporeSigma) (20 \u03bcL of 3H-DA per mL of 64 \u03bcM DA stock) with final DA concentrations of 6.4\u20130.05 \u03bcM. To evaluate dominant-negative effects of the hDAT-K619N variant on hDAT-WT function, the [3H]-DA uptake experiments were performed on HEK293 cells that were cotransfected with hDAT-K619N and hDAT-WT (1.5 \u03bcg of each construct) and compared with cells transfected with only hDAT-K619N or hDAT-WT (1.5 \u03bcg plus 1.5 \u03bcg empty DNA) as well as with cells transfected with 3 \u03bcg of DAT-WT as a control.

The SPECT data acquisition was begun after exactly 3 hours with a PRISM 3000XP (Marconi, Phillips) triple-headed gamma camera equipped with low-energy, ultra-high-resolution fan-beam collimators. Image reconstruction was performed using iterative reconstruction with scatter and nonuniform attenuation correction. Pixel size after reconstruction was x, y = 3.1 \u00d7 3.1 mm2 with a slice thickness of 6.2 mm. From the individual reformatted data set, the 2 neighboring striatal slices with maximum counts per pixel were summed and used for image analysis.

As an additional control, we injected mice with an AAV construct encoding Cre-dependent mCherry to account for unspecific effects related to surgery and protein overexpression. Immunohistochemical stainings of midbrain and striatal slices from TH-Cre mice injected with AAV8-DIO-HA-hDAT-WT, AAV8-DIO-HA-hDAT-K619N, or AAV8-DIO-mCherry confirmed expression of the viral transgenes in TH-positive neurons and revealed the presence of both HA-hDAT-WT and HA-hDAT-K619N in TH-labeled projections/axonal terminals in the striatum (Supplemental Figure 4).

Imaging was performed after surface labeling of DAT with an Oregon green\u2013conjugated fluorescent cocaine analog, MFZ 9-18 (36), which enabled identification of transfected cells without direct imaging of the SlowFT (see Methods) and allowed subsequent analysis of surface signal versus intracellularly located DAT. For both SlowFT-hDAT-WT and SlowFT-hDAT-K619N, the fluorescence from the blue and red timer forms colocalized at the membrane but showed only a partial overlap for the intracellular punctate structures (Figure 3A).

This alteration results in decreased dopamine reuptake, leading to an imbalance in dopamine levels and subsequent dysfunction in cellular and neurological processes. [1]\n\nThis insight is supported by the fact that a single copy of this variant is sufficient to cause significant dopamine dysfunction, challenging previous notions that multiple alleles were necessary for severe manifestations of Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders.  In fact, the latest research suggests that this variant may be a unifying factor in the development of these disorders, and could revolutionize our understanding of their underlying genetic mechanisms. \n\nFurthermore, the potential implications of this genetic marker extend beyond just understanding the diseases themselves. With the ability to identify carriers of the DAT-K619N variant through genetic testing, it opens up possibilities for preventative strategies and personalized treatment plans for individuals at risk.  This could also have an impact on the future of genetic counseling for these disorders.\n\nThe evolving nature of the virus that causes COVID-19 is a perfect example of how genetic markers, like the DAT-K619N variant, can have significant implications for our health. Variants such as KP.3.1.1, of the Omicron family, have been identified as the predominant variant in the United States, and their impact on COVID-19 activity is being closely monitored by the CDC.  This highlights the importance of continued research and understanding of genetic markers in order to stay ahead of evolving diseases and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the DAT-K619N variant has shown to be a critical factor in the development of Parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders, and its impact on dopamine dysfunction has far-reaching implications in the field of genetics and healthcare.", "user_utterance": "How does the DAT-K619N variant specifically alter dopamine transporter function and what are the consequences of this alteration in terms of cellular or neurological processes?", "search_queries": ["What is the DATK619N variant?", "How does the DATK619N variant impact dopamine transporter function?", "What are the consequences of the DATK619N variant in terms of cellular or neurological processes?"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.aamc.org/news/covid-surging-again-here-s-latest-new-variants-updated-vaccines-and-masking", "description": "On Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old.

A combination of slightly greater transmissibility, partial escape from immunity, and waning immunity from previous vaccinations and infections set the stage for another summer COVID-19 surge, explains David Montefiori, PhD, director of the Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development in the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.", "As of Aug. 3, the percentage of people reporting positive tests for the virus had reached its highest point since January of 2022, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also inched up, according to the CDC\u2019s data tracker. However, deaths remained far below the weekly rates during previous surges, with 340 reported during the week ending Aug. 3, compared with 2,578 weekly deaths during the last COVID-19 peak, in January 2024, and nearly 26,000 weekly deaths at the height of the pandemic in the United States, in January 2021.\nOn Aug. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the updated mRNA vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and granted emergency use authorization for the same vaccines for children six months to 11 years old. They are now available at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices.", "AAMCNews spoke with academic experts in infectious disease, viruses, and vaccines to answer some common questions about the latest variants and the new vaccines.\nHow are new variants different from previous strains?\nSARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, but most of the mutations are inconsequential, Montefiori explains.\n\u201cThere are many, many subvariants we don\u2019t even hear about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hear about the ones that are most common at a particular time.\u201d\nThe now-dominant KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which are part of a family of strains collectively referred to as FLiRT variants because of the part of the virus where they have mutated, are subvariants of JN.1, which is a subvariant of omicron.\nOmicron appeared in late 2021 and was the last variant to mutate enough to significantly escape immunity from the original strain and vaccines tailored to it. Since then, the variant mutations have had only small impacts on immune evasion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s very little difference among these variants [JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3], and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Montefiori says. \u201cHowever, all three of [them] have escaped [immunity] up to five- to tenfold, compared to the XBB variant contained in last fall\u2019s booster.\u201d\nScientists are most concerned when there are mutations to the virus\u2019s spike protein, which is what the virus uses to attach to and infect cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus that the vaccines have been developed to target. The FLiRT variants have several minor mutations to the spike protein \u2014 perhaps enough to trick antibodies for a while \u2014 but not enough to completely evade immunity, Montefiori explains.\nHow long are you protected after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or infection?", "The antibodies that are triggered from either a vaccination or an infection generally last for three to four months, notes Kawsar Talaat, MD, a vaccinologist and associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\nThe reason COVID-19 cases increased this summer is likely because people who hadn\u2019t been recently vaccinated or infected had fewer antibodies at the ready to fight off the first sign of the virus and were more likely to experience its symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, congestion, body aches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue.", "In a study examining COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska after vaccination with the 2023-2024 vaccines that targeted the XBB.1.5 variant, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness peaked four weeks after vaccination and then gradually waned, particularly as the new JN.1 variant began circulating.\n\u201cThe data showed very clearly [the vaccine-induced immunity] waning over time, indicating there\u2019s a need to target the circulating variants,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Danyu Lin, PhD, Dennis Gillings Distinguished Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill.\nHowever, he adds that there were greater uncertainties about the effectiveness against hospitalization and death than against infection due to the relatively small number of hospitalizations and deaths.", "As of May, only 22.5% of adults in the United States reported having received the updated 2023-2024 vaccine that was released last fall and tailored to the XBB variant dominant at that time, meaning many of those being infected now have significantly reduced immunity to the current mutated virus, Montefiori says.\nStill, those who have healthy immune systems and have previously been vaccinated or infected are less likely to experience the more severe cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. That\u2019s thanks to the immune system\u2019s second layer of defense \u2014 the T cells, which attack and kill infected cells, thereby shutting down the virus production factory.\nThis may be why hospitalizations and deaths rose only slightly this summer, since most people had some previous exposure to the virus, a vaccine, or both.\nWill the new vaccines target the latest variant?", "Decision-makers at the FDA faced a dilemma when it came to guidance for producing updated COVID-19 vaccines: Create vaccines tailored to the strain circulating in the spring, or wait to adapt the vaccine to a variant that was more likely to be dominant in the fall and risk delaying the production and rollout.\nAt its June meeting, members of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee debated the options: whether to recommend that manufacturers develop vaccines targeted toward JN.1, which was dominant until May, or targeted toward one of the FLiRT variants. Complicating the decision was the fact that Novavax, an American biotechnology company, had already developed a JN.1-targeted vaccine and the company said it wouldn\u2019t have time to change the formulation before the fall. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that doesn\u2019t use the newer mRNA technology that the other manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, use in their vaccines.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have Novavax as an option because some people are still concerned about mRNA [technology],\u201d says Mark Sawyer, MD, a professor of clinical pediatrics and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego, and a member of the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. \u201cNovavax allows them an option to still be protected.\u201d\nThe mRNA vaccines, which the CDC says are very safe based on safety data from millions of vaccinations, can be more quickly adapted to the FLiRT variants.\nThe advisory committee recommended that the FDA authorize vaccines targeting the JN.1 lineage rather than the KP.2, but the FDA\u2019s final decision was a preference for KP.2-targeted vaccines, while also allowing Novavax to proceed with the JN.1-targeted vaccine.", "In preclinical trials in mice, Moderna found that a previous version of the vaccine updated to target JN.1 showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against not only JN.1 but the FLiRT variants as well, according to a Moderna spokesperson.\nIn late August, the FDA approved the KP.2-targeted, mRNA vaccines for adults.\nMontefiori says that the specific formulation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, since the latest variants haven\u2019t mutated enough to avoid neutralizing antibodies completely. The important thing, he says, is to remain up-to-date on vaccination.\nIs it time to wear a mask again?\nWhile the days of mask mandates are in the past, some physicians advise strategic masking. In a recent interview with MedPage Today, Anthony Fauci, MD, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he wears a mask when on a plane or in a crowded indoor place, particularly because he is 83 years old and at high risk of severe COVID-19.", "Sawyer also recommends masking while traveling or in high-risk situations.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a community where the virus is surging, as so many people are, it is smart to wear a mask if you\u2019re in indoor, crowded conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially people who are at high risk, it\u2019s time to break out their masks again.\u201d\nWhat if I get COVID-19?", "If you start to experience any COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC recommends isolating to prevent spreading the virus to others, particularly those in high-risk groups, and taking an at-home COVID-19 test. The CDC also recommends that those in high-risk groups see their doctor for a prescription of the antiviral medication Paxlovid. This includes people 65 and older or anyone over age 12 with a condition that is a risk factor for severe COVID, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, obesity, or pregnancy. According to the Paxlovid website, 75% of Americans have a risk factor that might make them eligible for the antiviral. The prescription must be started within five to seven days of developing symptoms. One retrospective study found that Paxlovid treatment reduced hospitalization by 26% and death by 73%.", "Some people have reported a rebound of symptoms after taking Paxlovid and initially recovering from symptoms. The CDC says this could be a feature of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether the person took Paxlovid, and that anyone who experiences a rebound of COVID-19 symptoms should follow the isolation guidelines.\nAccording to CDC guidelines, you can resume normal activity if your symptoms have improved for 24 hours and you haven\u2019t had a fever in 24 hours without taking a fever suppressant, but you should continue to take extra precautions, like masking, for an additional five days.\nWhat will the future of COVID-19 entail? Will we need new vaccines every year?\nMontefiori predicts that we will need annual updated COVID-19 vaccines, just as seasonal flu shots are the norm.", "However, future vaccines may be different. Moderna is testing a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. A nasal vaccine, also in the works, might be more effective at preventing infection, since the virus is airborne and the antibodies could be more localized to catch the virus upon entry to the body, Talaat explains.\nBut how well the vaccines work will depend largely on people getting them. Though COVID-19 is not as dangerous as it once was, it is still deadly for some, including young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, and it carries the risk of long COVID.\nThe mRNA vaccines have a strong safety profile, Sawyer says, with data from millions of vaccinations showing that the worst side effects \u2014 myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder) \u2014 are incredibly rare.", "\u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine than not, even with all of its weaknesses,\" Sawyer says. \u201cThe fact that it doesn\u2019t last that long, and it takes time and effort to go get it, all of those things are worth it to protect yourself and your family.\u201d"], "title": "COVID is surging again.

It gradually impairs a person\u2019s ability to function until they ultimately become immobile and often develop dementia. In the U.S. alone, over a million people are afflicted with Parkinson\u2019s, and new cases and overall numbers are steadily increasing.\nThere is currently no treatment to slow or halt Parkinson\u2019s disease. Available drugs don\u2019t slow disease progression and can treat only certain symptoms. Medications that work early in the disease, however, such as Levodopa, generally become ineffective over the years, necessitating increased doses that can lead to disabling side effects. Without understanding the fundamental molecular cause of Parkinson\u2019s, it\u2019s improbable that researchers will be able to develop a medication to stop the disease from steadily worsening in patients.", "Many factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson\u2019s, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson\u2019s aren\u2019t inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable.\nNevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson\u2019s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease.\nGenetic linkages and associations", "In the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson\u2019s might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson\u2019s: linkage analysis and association studies.\nLinkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson\u2019s, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson\u2019s appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries.", "\u201cLinkage\u201d between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes. Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson\u2019s. Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson\u2019s in the general population.", "Conversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson\u2019s with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don\u2019t have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analyzing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people.", "Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease. However, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal.\nTogether, \u201clinked\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson\u2019s. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson\u2019s? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data?", "Parkinson\u2019s disease genes\nUsing linkage analysis, my team and I identified a new genetic mutation for Parkinson\u2019s disease called RAB32 Ser71Arg. This mutation was linked to parkinsonism in three families and found in 13 other people in several countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Tunisia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nAlthough the affected individuals and families originate from many parts of the world, they share an identical fragment of chromosome 6 that contains RAB32 Ser71Arg. This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify.\nWith further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease. The RAB32 Ser71Arg variant also causes similar dysfunction within cells.", "Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is lost in Parkinson\u2019s as the cells that produce it progressively die. Together, these linked genes and the proteins they encode regulate specialized autophagy processes. In addition, these encoded proteins enable immunity within cells.\nSuch linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson\u2019s in later life.", "RAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries. The proteins encoded bring together three important functions of the cell: autophagy, immunity and mitochondrial function. While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell\u2019s trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because they evolved from bacteria the cell\u2019s immune system recognizes as \u201cself\u201d rather than as an invading pathogen to destroy.\nIdentifying subtle genetic differences\nFinding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson\u2019s is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease. Like the owner\u2019s manual to your car\u2019s engine, it provides a practical guide of what to check when the motor fails.", "Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that influence the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease.\nMore patients and families participating in genetic research are needed to find additional components of the engine behind Parkinson\u2019s. Each person\u2019s genome has about 27 million variants of the 6 billion building blocks that make up their genes. There are many more genetic components for Parkinson\u2019s that have yet to be found.\nAs our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson\u2019s."], "title": "Newly discovered genetic variant that causes Parkinson\u2019s disease ..."}, {"url": "https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-024-00437-6", "description": "Additionally, it is necessary to consider the impact of medication factors and the on/off status of clinical symptoms when evaluating patients. ...

GCase activity is highly variable in populations. Besides the type of GBA1 mutation, GCase activity is also related to factors such as the sample source and type, sample storage condition and duration, the number of times the samples are frozen and thawed, the assay method used, and other genetic or environmental factors . Although the conclusions have not been entirely consistent, current evidence supports the notion that loss of GCase function may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of PD and is a potential therapeutic target.", "GBA1-targeting therapy\nGene therapies entail rectifying disease-related genetic abnormalities by introducing therapeutic genes and their accompanying regulatory components into the cell nucleus. In the context of GBA1-PD, gene therapies often utilize viral vectors carrying intact GBA1 gene sequences (Fig. 6). Direct administration or systemic injection of a functioning GBA1 gene into animals increased GCase activity, decreased GlcSph accumulation, and reduced \u03b1-syn accumulation, thereby improving motor and memory deficits and protecting dopaminergic neurons . Based on this promising evidence, a clinical trial of AAV9 (adeno-associated virus 9)-based gene therapy (LY3884961, formerly known as PR001) is currently underway for GBA1-PD.

Different GBA1 variants may result in diverse structures and functions of GCase. Certain variants may induce ER retention, preventing GCase from reaching the lysosome or causing ER stress and cellular demise ; truncating mutations result in protein deletion and thus loss of function ; and others may affect enzyme function by altering the active site conformation . Therefore, a balanced distribution of different mutations is essential during selection of participants to minimize the mutation-related bias. In addition, close attention should be paid to GCase modifiers such as CTSB, TMEM175, and LRRK2 when enrolling participants .\nConclusions", "GBA1 associated with PD", "Mizushima N, Levine B.

Depending on the neurologic impairment, GD can be categorized into three subgroups. Type 1 is the predominant, non-neuronopathic form that may occur at any age. Types 2 and 3 generally have a more pronounced severity, often accompanied by different levels of neurologic damage . These two subtypes are often referred to as neuronopathic GD. The acute neuronopathic type 2 GD is the rarest and most severe form. Patients with this type of GD usually die before the age of 2 years. The chronic neuronopathic type 3 GD is an intermediate form as it impairs functions of the central nervous system more slowly and gradually than type 2. Nonetheless, the entire spectrum of GD encompasses a diverse array of clinical manifestations, and neurologic impairment can manifest throughout the course of the disease .\nGBAP1", ". LIMP2 belongs to the CD36 family, is mainly distributed in the limiting membrane of lysosomes and is a receptor involved in the lysosomal translocation of GCase. LIMP2 binds GCase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and reaches the lysosome via the Golgi system, where GCase dissociates from LIMP2 upon reaching the lysosome due to the acidic pH , where it subsequently interacts with the co-factor saposin C and negatively charged lipids for optimal catalysis activity (Fig. 2) . Mutations in the GBA1 gene can lead to structural modifications of the GCase protein, resulting in decreased activity, stability, and protein levels of GCase, causing intracellular accumulation of its main substrate, GlcCer, in the reticuloendothelial system, which in turn gives rise to a spectrum of clinical symptoms, such as hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone abnormalities, and neurodegeneration .", "Inflammatory response", "Pajares M, Rojo AI, Manda G, Bosca L, Cuadrado A.

GBA1 D409V-knock-in mouse astrocytes exhibit extensive defects in lysosomal morphology and function, including reduced lysosome numbers, fewer acidic vesicles, and reduced lysosomal degradative activity . GCase-deficient Drosophila exhibit many abnormally expanded lysosomes in the brain . The mechanisms by which the loss of GCase activity affects lysosomes are unclear. GCase dysfunction impairs the lysosomal compartment, establishing a lysosome\u2013plasma membrane axis that leads to structural changes of the plasma membrane and alterations of intracellular signaling pathways. At the same time, accumulation of GlcCer or GlcSph, substrates of GCase, could contribute to lysosomal dysfunction and toxicity .", "Mechanism of GBA1 involvement in PD\nIn recent years, research has delved into the role of mutant GBA1 in the pathogenesis of PD. GBA1-PD does not strictly adhere to Mendelian laws, as both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations have been associated with an elevated risk of developing PD. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of PD from GBA1 variants remain incompletely understood. Research progress has indicated the involvement of dopaminergic neuronal damage, \u03b1-syn aggregation, lipid metabolism disorders, autophagy-lysosome dysfunction, ER stress, mitochondrial damage, and inflammatory responses (Fig. 4). In the following, we will discuss each of the listed mechanisms separately in detail.\nGCase and dopaminergic neurons", "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The development of PD is closely linked to genetic and environmental factors, with GBA1 variants being the most common genetic risk. Mutations in the GBA1 gene lead to reduced activity of the coded enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, which mediates the development of PD by affecting lipid metabolism (especially sphingolipids), lysosomal autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum, as well as mitochondrial and other cellular functions. Clinically, PD with GBA1 mutations (GBA1-PD) is characterized by particular features regarding the progression of symptom severity. On the therapeutic side, the discovery of the relationship between GBA1 variants and PD offers an opportunity for targeted therapeutic interventions. In this review, we explore the genotypic and phenotypic correlations, etiologic mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches of GBA1-PD and summarize the current state of research and its challenges.\nIntroduction", "Penetrance is the ratio of all individuals carrying a disease-associated allele to those affected by the disease. Large-scale sequencing and genotyping studies provide a powerful means to understand the penetrance of pathological mutations/genotypes. The main methods used to estimate penetrance of mutations in PD are the Kaplan\u2013Meier method for unrelated individuals and the kin-cohort method within families . The penetrance of GBA1 increases with age, with the reported penetrance for GBA1 heterozygous mutations ranging from 10% to 30% at 80 years of age, suggesting that the majority of GBA1 heterozygous mutation carriers will never develop PD . Similarly, follow-up of nine GBA1 L444P/R non-manifesting carriers for up to 10 years did not find any of them developing PD ", "Pandey MK, Burrow TA, Rani R, Martin LJ, Witte D, Setchell KD, et al.

In GD, GCase activity is typically 10%\u201320% of that in normal individuals . Different mechanisms can lead to reduced GCase activity, such as a loss of transcription/translation, misfolded GCase proteins that promote ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), inability of GCase to leave the Golgi apparatus, or loss of key amino acids in its catalytic domains. Similarly, different GBA1 variants may affect GCase activity through different mechanisms. For example, the L444P and N370S variants are associated with UPR activation and ER stress and may disrupt binding between GCase and saposin C, preventing saposin C activation of GCase ", "Cecioni S, Ashmus RA, Gilormini PA, Zhu S, Chen X, Shan X, et al.

Understanding the biological changes induced by these genetic variants is both important and challenging. Despite the complexity, studies of PD-associated genes have focused on a number of common pathogenic pathways, including lysosomal dysfunction, impaired intracellular trafficking, inflammatory signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathways have been linked to dopaminergic neuronal damage .", "Currently, over 300 GBA1 mutations and gene rearrangements have been reported. The classification of GBA1 variants is mainly based on the GD phenotype caused by the mutation. Mild mutations are typically associated with type 1 GD, whereas severe mutations lead to types 2 and 3 GD. Certain variants of the GBA1 gene do not result in GD when present in homozygous carriers; however, these variants elevate the susceptibility to PD and are therefore categorized as \u201crisk\u201d variants. Additionally, a growing number of \u201cunknown\u201d variants have been reported, owing to the limited knowledge of their pathogenicity concerning GD or PD. Overall, 5.9% are classified as mild (e.g., N370S, R496H), 22.6% as severe (e.g., L444P, 84GG, IVS2 + 1, V394L, and D409H), and 0.8% as risk (E326K, T369M, and E388K), with the remaining categorized as unknown (e.g., A456P, K(-27)R, R39C, and R44C) ", "Animal studies have shown that reducing GSLs with GlcCer synthase inhibitor slows the progression of synucleinopathy .

Within the ER, the protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation at four asparagine residues and quality control . Mutant GCase proteins are misfolded, resulting in varying degrees of ER retention, triggering ER stress, UPR, and Golgi fragmentation . UPR and ER stress can result in autophagy damage, increased apoptosis, and lysosomal insufficiency, weakening the protective role of autophagy against synucleopathies and ultimately contributing to PD development . ER stress and UPR activation markers are elevated in GBA1-mutant brain tissues as well as cellular and animal models , supporting the conclusion that GBA1 mutations cause abnormal changes in ER function. In \u03b1-syn-overexpressing neurons, the inability of LIMP2 to bind to GCase leads to increased GCase retention in the ER and decreased GCase activity in the lysosome .\nMitochondrial dysfunction", "Previous research has established a clear correlation between genes regulating lysosomal function and PD . Recent studies revealed that over 50% of individuals with PD possess one or more putative damaging variants among the lysosome storage disorder (LSD) genes . Among the various genetic factors identified, the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) is emerging as the predominant hereditary contributor to PD. GBA1 encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is responsible for breaking down glucosylceramide (GlcCer) . In this review, we will summarize the genotypic and phenotypic correlations, etiological mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches for GBA1-PD as well as current challenges in its studies. Advances in GBA1-PD neuroimaging will not be included here, as they have been extensively reviewed elsewhere .\nGBA1 and Gaucher\u2019s disease (GD)", ". Notably, a study in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage showed an increased risk for PD in both patients with GD (carrying 2 mutant GBA1 alleles) and heterozygote carriers (carrying 1 mutant GBA1 allele); however, the overall risk for developing the disease was similar between the two groups of patients, suggesting that the number of mutant alleles may not affect the penetrance .", "ER stress\nER stress may cause several neurodegenerative disorders. GBA1 abnormalities can also induce PD through ER dysfunction. ER is essential for protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. Dysregulation of ER homeostasis can activate the UPR, initiating a cascade of significant stressors within the ER. This response aims to restore the equilibrium but may activate pathways that lead to cellular demise .", "Biomarker studies of GBA1-PD\nObjective biomarkers for GBA1-PD are still lacking, but dysfunction in the GCase pathway offers insights into potential biomarkers for PD. GCase activity and sphingolipid content can be determined from specimens such as brain tissue and blood. These biomarkers can potentially improve patient management and counseling in clinical settings, and serve as metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of GCase-targeting therapy .\nGCase enzymatic activity", ".

Numerous basic studies have demonstrated the close relationship between GCase and \u03b1-syn (Table 1) . Examination of mutations across several vertebrate species indicates a potential co-evolutionary relationship between GCase and \u03b1-syn, as alterations in either protein can hinder their interaction. Decreased GCase activity may lead to oligomerization of \u03b1-syn aggregates, and accumulated \u03b1-syn may also impede GCase migration from the ER to the lysosome, resulting in a decrease in GCase activity, leading to a pathogenic feedback loop .", "Deng YN, Shi J, Liu J, Qu QM.

Over time, researchers have found that both biallelic and monoallelic mutations in GBA1 can increase the susceptibility to PD . In 2009, a comprehensive meta-analysis involving 16 centers worldwide revealed an odds ratio of 5.43 for any GBA1 mutation between PD patients and the control group, underscoring GBA1 variants as a common risk factor for PD . GBA1 mutation carriers face a significantly heightened rate of developing PD, ranging from 5 to 30 times , and this risk is influenced by factors such as age, ethnicity, and mutation type, with carriers of severe GBA1 mutations having a 3- to 4-fold higher risk than carriers of mild GBA1 mutations ", ". The recombination events between GBA1 and GBAP1 result in several different Gaucher mutations and mutant groups. The highest homology between GBA1 and GBAP1 is between exons 8 and 11; thus, the majority of disease-causing mutations are clustered at this position . Pseudogenes can act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for their parental genes and compete for regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). GBAP1 may act as a ceRNA to regulate GBA1 expression through miRNAs . The complexity of GBA1 gene rearrangements cannot be adequately captured using most current next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, and Sanger sequencing should be used to achieve most accurate genotyping. Long-read NGS has improved ability to distinguish functional genes such as GBA1 from their pseudogenes; however, currently, its ability to identify recombinant alleles is still limited ", ". Conversely, another study found decreased GCase activity in the fibroblasts and dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs from LRRK2 mutation carriers, and this reduction could be reversed by inhibiting LRRK2 kinase . Thus, the LRRK2 kinase activity affects GCase activity differently depending on the test medium, the cell type, and the technique employed.", "The reason for the relatively low rate of PD phenotypic transformation in individuals carrying GBA1 mutations remains elusive. Genetic factors may be involved. The GBA1-associated risk is significantly influenced by the genetic risk score. Specific locus variants, such as SNCA and CTSB, could also influence the risk of PD by interacting with GBA1. In addition, environmental, aging, and epigenetic factors are also involved . Therefore, in studies targeting GBA1 penetrance, a comprehensive assessment of genetic factors should be performed , taking into account the influence of non-genetic factors such as environmental factors, aging, demographics/ethnicity and diet.

Many neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, are associated with lysosomal abnormalities. Autophagy is the cellular process through which an organism removes proteins and degrades dysfunctional organelles within the cell, which may prevent cytotoxicity and cell death. Since \u03b1-syn undergoes degradation within lysosomes, dysfunction in the ALP could hinder the clearance of \u03b1-syn, leading to its aggregation into harmful oligomers. Consequently, this can exacerbate the cycle of impaired autophagy and lysosomal function . Evidence from experimental PD models suggests a strong association between GBA1 and ALP regulation .", ".  showed that although increased \u03b1-syn affects GCase transport and lysosomal function in both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells, oxidized dopamine accumulation was only observed in dopaminergic cells, which could reduce wild-type or mutant GCase activity . In GBA1-PD organoid studies, NURR1, a transcription factor essential for the differentiation, maturation, and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, was found to be significantly reduced, and this reduction led to reduced dopamine production and increased susceptibility of these neurons . It has also been hypothesized that mutated GCase proteins do not fold sufficiently in the ER, leading to protein accumulation in the cellular compartment, which induces dopaminergic neuronal response to stress, causing their damage and death .", ". It is important to note that the relationships between genotype and phenotype are not universally applicable, given that there are some outliers. Parlar et al. recently compiled an inventory of all GBA1 mutations found in patients with PD and developed an online viewer (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/gba1browser/) to search for these variants. The browser summarizes all reported GBA1 variants in PD to date, and in addition to classifying the variants as described above, they also categorize the pathogenicity of GBA1 variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification of variant in GD (Additional file 1: Table S1). Notably, the distribution of GBA1 variants varies significantly in different ethnic groups. The most common GBA1 mutation in PD among Ashkenazi Jewish is the N370S mutation", "The autophagy pathway can be categorized into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Macroautophagy is the primary regulated type of autophagy that responds to environmental and physiological cues, microautophagy involves the direct engulfment of cytoplasmic contents by lysosomes through membranous invaginations, and CMA is a protein-exclusive type of autophagy involving chaperone-assisted translocation of substrate proteins across the lysosomal membrane . Macroautophagy and CMA are particularly relevant to PD . Cells and animal models deficient in GCase show impairment of ALP, with decreased lysosomal GCase activity for macroautophagy and CMA and interfering with \u03b1-syn clearance .

Studies using many cellular/neuronal models have also shown that GBA1 mutations can exacerbate the bioenergetic burden on dopaminergic neurons via disruption of lipid homeostasis, release of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired calcium homeostasis . However, downregulation of GCase expression alone is not sufficient to cause the key pathological features of PD in vivo. Synergization with \u03b1-syn overexpression is required for GCase deficiency to drive nigrostriatal neurodegeneration . A study by Henderson et al.  showed that reduced GCase activity alone does not lead to the aggregation of \u03b1-syn, but rather functions by enhancing the aggregation of pre-existing misfolded \u03b1-syn, and this modulatory effect is not dependent on the neuronal type. Indeed, \u03b1-syn and GCase are widely expressed in the brain, affecting different cell types . Notably, Burbulla et al", "The relationship between genotype and phenotype is complex. Although the general phenotype of GBA1-PD resembles idiopathic PD, patients with GBA1-PD exhibit distinct clinical features as a group . GBA1 mutations accelerate the neurodegenerative process, resulting in significantly impaired dopaminergic functions and a more severe clinical phenotype . Specifically, GBA1-PD tends to have an earlier onset , is more likely to have a family history, and is associated with more severe motor and non-motor symptoms. In addition, patients with GBA1-PD have more rapid disease progression and higher mortality (Fig. 3) .", "Since 2012, studies using brain autopsy and dried blood spot testing have reported reduced GCase activity in PD patients . Since most patients with GBA1-PD still have a wild-type GBA1 allele, GCase activity is only slightly reduced when compared with controls, and the extent of this reduction may be related to the variant classification . As seen in brain tissue assays, there is a general decrease in GCase activity in patients with GBA1-PD, with the most significant decrease in the substantia nigra . However, findings on GCase activity have been inconsistent and, rather surprisingly, reduced GCase protein level and enzyme activity have also been reported in patients with sporadic PD . Compared to brain biopsy, blood samples can be collected prospectively and longitudinally, and the procedure is less invasive than lumbar puncture", "A central question regarding GBA1-related PD is how the loss of GCase activity predisposes dopaminergic neurons to the accumulation of \u03b1-syn . Although there may be a bidirectional feedback loop between GCase deficiency and \u03b1-syn accumulation, it does not explain the selective vulnerability of midbrain dopaminergic neurons . However, there is much evidence to support a strong link between GBA1 variants and dopaminergic neurons. For example, the GCase enzyme activity was found to be reduced in dopaminergic neurons from patients with GBA1-PD, and there is a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain . In Drosophila, mutant GCase and \u03b1-syn have synergistic deleterious effects on dopaminergic cells ", ".

In 2015, the first study on dried blood spot GCase activity in GBA1-PD was conducted , showing that the GBA1-PD heterozygotes exhibit lower GCase activity than controls.

The surveillance protocol comprises a minimum program and an extended version for consideration. The key recommendations of the minimum program are: annual clinical examination from birth to age 20 years, six-monthly chest X-ray and renal ultrasound from birth to age 6 years, and thyroid ultrasound every 3 years from age 8 to age 40 years. The surveillance program for consideration comprises additional surveillance procedures, and recommendations for DICER1 pathogenic variant carriers outside the ages of the surveillance interval. Patients have to be supported in choosing the surveillance program that best meets their needs. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and patient perspectives of proposed surveillance recommendations is required to expand the evidence base for DICER1 surveillance protocols."], "title": "Surveillance recommendations for DICER1 pathogenic variant carriers: a ..."}]}]}]
