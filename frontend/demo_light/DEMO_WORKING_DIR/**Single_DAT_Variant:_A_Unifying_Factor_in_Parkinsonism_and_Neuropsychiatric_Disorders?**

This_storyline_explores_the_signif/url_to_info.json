Disturbances in dopaminergic neurotransmission are widely implicated in neurological diseases, such as Parkinson disease, and in psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression (1, 3\u20136). As a critical regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission (7), the human DA transporter (hDAT) gene, SLC6A3, has received enduring attention in candidate gene studies of Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases (8). DAT mediates high-affinity reuptake of DA and thereby regulates the spatiotemporal propagation of DA transients and ensures a synthesis-independent DA source to dopaminergic terminals (9)", "Our subsequent in vivo and ex vivo experiments indicated that the hDAT-K619N variant can give rise to changes in DA function of potential pathological importance. The experiments also affirmed that the molecular phenotype is markedly more pronounced in vivo, consistent with a previous finding for the DAT-AAA mutation (31). Thus, we found that whole-brain DA uptake was reduced by approximately 35% and amphetamine-induced DA efflux was reduced by more than 80% in flies expressing the hDAT-K619N variant compared with hDAT-WT. Moreover, young flies expressing hDAT-K619N demonstrated hyperlocomotion and an enhanced negative geotactic response compared with hDAT-WT\u2013expressing flies.

Arvid Carlsson published research in the same year that confirmed dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain, as opposed to another precursor molecule.\nDopamine is highly concentrated in areas of the brain called the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain. Other brain areas where dopamine can be made are the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb.", "This suggested that schizophrenia might stem from reduced dopamine function in the prefrontal cortex, leading to increased dopamine in other areas (mesolimbic).

Yet, imaging studies revealed that schizophrenic patients release more dopamine than healthy individuals in response to certain scenarios (Laruelle et al., 1996).\nThe discovery of organic changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients through imaging techniques shifted the focus to viewing schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "Also, dopamine abnormalities in the temporal and prefrontal areas of the brain are believed to be overactive in those with schizophrenia and thus can lead to some of the positive symptoms of the condition, such as hallucinations and delusions.\nThis hypothesis aligns with the use of some antipsychotic drug medications, which work to block dopamine receptor in the brain appear to be effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.\nLikewise, the effects of dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine, over repeated exposure, may gradually induce paranoid psychosis in non-schizophrenic people.\nThis well-documented observation shows that sustained increases in dopamine activity can cause some of the similar symptoms of schizophrenia.\nHowever, the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia may be an oversimplification as there may be many other neuronal network abnormalities and neurotransmitter systems involved in causing the condition.", "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that serves as a chemical messenger in the brain.

The flood of dopamine to the brain when experiencing a pleasurable stimulus (e.g., delicious food, video games, sex) can reinforce wanting to engage with this stimulus more due to the pleasurable feeling it causes.\nThis is a cycle of motivation, reward, and reinforcement. When associating a certain activity with pleasure, sometimes even mere anticipation may be enough to raise dopamine levels.", "Research since the dopamine hypothesis has indicated that glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, and serotonin alterations are also involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, so it may not be dopamine alone which affects this condition.\nWhat about the future?\nWe know a lot about two types of dopamine receptors in the brain, but less about three others.

Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes. Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson\u2019s. Nevertheless, what causes inherited parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson\u2019s in the general population."], "title": "Newly discovered genetic variant that causes Parkinson\u2019s disease ..."}, "https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/variant-that-causes-parkinsons-disease-clarifies-why-the-condition-develops": {"url": "https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/variant-that-causes-parkinsons-disease-clarifies-why-the-condition-develops", "description": "Many factors may contribute to the development of Parkinson\u2019s, both environmental and genetic. Until recently, underlying genetic causes of the disease were unknown. Most cases of Parkinson\u2019s aren\u2019t inherited but sporadic, and early studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable. Nevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation.", "snippets": ["Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson\u2019s disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that influence the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease.\nMore patients and families participating in genetic research are needed to find additional components of the engine behind Parkinson\u2019s. Each person\u2019s genome has about 27 million variants of the 6 billion building blocks that make up their genes. There are many more genetic components for Parkinson\u2019s that have yet to be found.\nAs our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson\u2019s."], "title": "Variant That Causes Parkinson\u2019s Disease Clarifies Why The Condition ..."}}}
