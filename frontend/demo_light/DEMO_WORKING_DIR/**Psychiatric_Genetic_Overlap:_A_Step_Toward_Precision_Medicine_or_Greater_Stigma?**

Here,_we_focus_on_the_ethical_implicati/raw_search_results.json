The research received primary funding from NIH\u2019s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), along with other NIH components.\nAs reported online in the Lancet on February 28, 2013, the scientists screened for evidence of illness-associated genetic variation among over 33,000 patients.

A comparison group included about 28,000 people who had no major psychiatric diagnosis.", "You are here\nMarch 18, 2013\nCommon Genetic Factors Found in 5 Mental Disorders\nMajor mental disorders traditionally thought to be distinct share certain genetic glitches, according to a new study. The finding may point to better ways to diagnose and treat these conditions.\nScientists have long recognized that many psychiatric disorders tend to run in families, suggesting potential genetic roots. Such disorders include autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia. Symptoms can overlap and so distinguishing among these 5 major psychiatric syndromes can be difficult. Their shared symptoms suggest they may also share similarities at the biological level. In fact, recent studies have turned up limited evidence of shared genetic risk factors, such as for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, autism and schizophrenia, and depression and bipolar disorder.", "The analysis revealed variations significantly associated with all 5 disorders. These included variations in 2 genes that code for the cellular machinery that helps regulate the flow of calcium into neurons. Variation in one of these, called CACNA1C, had previously been linked to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and major depression. CACNA1C is known to affect brain circuitry involved in emotion, thinking, attention and memory \u2014 functions that can be disrupted in mental illnesses. Variation in another calcium channel gene, called CACNB2, was also linked to the 5 disorders.\nIn addition, the researchers discovered illness-linked variation for all 5 disorders in certain regions of chromosomes 3 and 10. Each of these sites spans several genes, and causal factors haven\u2019t yet been pinpointed. The suspect region along chromosome 3 had the strongest links to the disorders. This region also harbors certain variations previously linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.", "\u201cAlthough statistically significant, each of these genetic associations individually can account for only a small amount of risk for mental illness,\u201d says study co-author Dr. Jordan Smoller of Massachusetts General Hospital. Because of this, the variations couldn\u2019t yet be used to predict or diagnose specific conditions. But these results may help researchers move closer to making more accurate diagnoses. They may also help lead to a better understanding of the factors that cause these major mental disorders.\nRelated Links\n- Video: NIH\u2019s Dr. Bruce Cuthbert discusses the findings\n- Schizophrenia\n- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n- Autism Spectrum Disorders\n- Depression\n- Genome-Wide Association Studies\nReferences: Lancet. 2013 Feb 27. pii: S0140-6736(12)62129-1. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62129-1.

A meta-analysis of eight mental disorders identified 109 independent genetic loci associated with two or more disorders (\n8). Interestingly, 11 of these had \u201cdiscordant\u201d effects, that is, they increased the risk of one disorder but decreased the risk of a second (\n8). This is supported by findings from pairwise analyses (\n9,\n10) that have identified hundreds of shared loci between mental disorders and related traits such as intelligence (\n11,\n12) and personality traits (\n13), with a mixture of concordant and discordant effects (\nFigure 1A). Such extensive \u201cpleiotropy\u201d calls into question the traditional conceptualization of genetic risk, in which a specific set of genes is implicated for a specific disorder (\n14).\nAlthough r\ng is an informative measure of the genetic similarity between two phenotypes, it does not capture all dimensions of genetic overlap. Shared genetic variants can have either concordant or discordant effects (\n12,\n17,\n18). However, since r", "17). Together, this indicates that most common variants that influence the genetic risk for diverse mental phenotypes are highly pleiotropic and may have both risk-enhancing and risk-reducing effects on different disorders and traits. Consequently, it may be the specific distribution of effect sizes of highly pleiotropic variants that predominantly contributes to the development of a given mental disorder rather than a set of phenotype-specific variants.\nThis conceptual insight extends the current theories of genetic susceptibility for mental traits and disorders. These are traditionally based on the assumption that a specific set of genes is implicated for a given mental disorder, with varying degrees of genetic overlap across disorders, reflected by their genetic correlations (\n8,\n16,", "17). Building on previous work highlighting extensive overlap across mental disorders (\n13,\n17), this represents a conceptual advance in our understanding of the genetic architecture of mental disorders, which may inform strategies for genetic discovery, biological characterization, and psychiatric nosology, providing the foundations for the development of precision psychiatry and treatment stratification across diagnostic boundaries.\nFirst, we used univariate MiXeR to show that the genetic architectures of mental traits exhibit fundamental differences beyond heritability, with differences in polygenicity across the eight included traits. Among mental disorders, this was most pronounced between ADHD and depression, although lower polygenicities have recently been reported for migraine (\n23), cortical MRI measures, and other somatic traits (\n23\u2013", "gs), in addition to r\ng (\nFigure 1B). Using MiXeR, we have demonstrated extensive genetic overlap across several mental disorders and related traits with mixed effect directions (\n13,\n18,\n21). The relevance of mixed effects has been further emphasized by LAVA, which calculates local genetic correlations across the genome (\n20). Despite employing a distinct statistical framework, LAVA revealed widespread local genetic correlations across somatic and mental traits with mixed effect directions, even in the presence of minimal r\ng (\n20). However, neither MiXeR nor LAVA has been systematically applied across mental disorders and cognitive and personality traits using the largest-to-date GWASs.", ". These findings place greater emphasis on efforts to improve the specificity of psychiatric diagnostic categories, potentially offering a means to test the genetic heterogeneity of hypothesized subgroups through estimates of polygenicity. This may aid efforts to refine the current nosological system, with potential for improved translation of genetic findings into clinically meaningful prediction and stratification tools, and improved drug target identification.", "25). While the neurobiological and clinical implications of these findings are currently speculative, it is possible that polygenicity is a marker of heterogeneity at the neurobiological and/or clinical level. For example, ADHD may represent a more neurobiologically and/or clinically homogeneous population than depression. By extension, polygenicity may be a useful marker of genetic heterogeneity, which could be used to test the effect of biomarkers or clinically defined subgroups on the genetic makeup of a given disorder. Differences in polygenicity may also be due to differences in biological complexity or negative selection (\n26,\n27). More deeply phenotyped samples and improved functional characterization of genetic loci are required to provide further insights.", "28). However, this is inconsistent with the extent of genetic overlap observed when accounting for mixed effect directions, which may provide a better conceptual framework for the neurobiology of mental traits and disorders. The brain is a complex organ with abundant pleiotropy across different brain regions (\n29), brain functions (\n30), and mental traits (\n31). Thus, it is likely that differences in activity in the same neurobiological systems alter diverse mental traits and disorders, but the magnitude and direction of effect may differ across and within diagnostic categories, exemplified by evidence of increased glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia (\n32) but decreased transmission in depression (\n33). This is also consistent with the fact that most genetic variants associated with mental disorders reside within regulatory elements rather than coding regions (", "38). This may also help to explain the large degree of comorbidity and the prominence of overlapping clinical characteristics observed across mental disorders. Alternatively, once greater proportions of the SNP-based heritability of mental disorders have been characterized, it may be possible to parse the heritable component into constituent biological processes. This may enable construction of a personalized, biologically informed diagnostic system, similar to the \u201cpalette model\u201d proposed for diabetes (\n39). As the era of large-scale case-control GWASs transitions toward deeply phenotyped clinical and population samples (\n40), it will be of great interest whether subphenotyping results in more specific genetic signals. This will also be highly relevant for the clinical application of polygenic risk scores, which require not only improved explained variance but also the ability to discriminate across diagnostic groups or clinically relevant decisions.", "8). This may indicate distinct clinical subgroups with higher rates of comorbidity, or shared involvement of specific molecular mechanisms with similar effects on both disorders. Further investigation of the shared genetic architecture of ADHD and depression may prove fruitful for the identification of underlying biological mechanisms and new treatment targets (\n41\u2013\n43).\nThere was substantially less genetic overlap between mental disorders and height, with approximately 1,000 shared \u201ccausal\u201d variants across all pairwise analyses. This may represent nonspecific \u201cbackground\u201d genetic overlap observed across all polygenic traits, or, alternatively, it may capture highly pleiotropic transcription factors or regulatory elements that influence diverse traits across distinct tissues and systems. (See the Supplementary Discussion section in the\nonline supplement for additional discussion of the relevance of our findings to the\np factor hypothesis.)", "Mental disorders are among the most heritable complex human disorders. For schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), twin studies have estimated broad sense heritabilities of 40%\u201380% (\n1\u2013\n4). Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have since shown that approximately one-third is driven by thousands of common genetic variants, each with individually small effect (\n5). As ever-expanding GWAS sample sizes bring genetic prediction and stratification tools closer to the clinic (\n6), a better understanding of the complex genetic architecture of mental disorders is needed to address questions regarding disease classification and the potential for precision medicine in psychiatry.\nLarger GWAS sample sizes have also revealed extensive shared genetic risk variants across diagnostic categories, mirroring their overlapping clinical characteristics (", "Despite the pervasive overlap, the number of shared and unique \u201ccausal\u201d variants varied across phenotypic pairs, sometimes revealing the presence of strongly correlated shared variants despite moderate genome-wide genetic correlation. This pattern was most evident between ADHD and depression, a finding supported by LAVA. This suggests that although a large proportion of depression-associated variants are not associated with ADHD, those that are shared have highly similar effects. This mirrors recent findings from a genomic structural equation modeling approach that clustered depression with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD (", "We applied MiXeR and LAVA to large-scale GWASs of ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, and cognitive and personality traits to characterize their genetic overlap beyond rg. We aimed to map 1) polygenicity, 2) genetic overlap allowing mixed effect directions, 3) rgs, and 4) local genetic correlations, using height as a comparator. We compared MiXeR estimates of mixed effect directions to LAVA local correlations to validate our findings across two distinct statistical frameworks. By charting the landscape of genetic overlap beyond rg, we provide insights into the unique and shared genetic architectures underlying psychiatric disorders, with implications for how we conceptualize genetic risk for mental disorders and related traits.\nDiscussion", "In this cross-trait genetic analysis of ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, and cognitive and personality traits, we systematically quantified genetic architecture beyond genome-wide genetic correlations. We found marked differences in polygenicity but extensive genetic overlap across all mental disorders and cognitive and personality traits, with few disorder-specific variants. These findings were supported by LAVA local correlations, which also revealed patterns of mixed effect directions concealed by estimates of genome-wide genetic correlations. This indicates that, rather than a predominance of disorder-specific risk variants, there may be a set of highly pleiotropic variants that influence the risk of diverse mental disorders and related traits. By extension, phenotypic specificity may be largely driven by the distribution of effect sizes and effect directions across this pool of pleiotropic variants rather than variants unique to each phenotype (", ". This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement nos. 847776, 964874, and 801133 (Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement).", "34). Allelic variation may therefore \u201ctune\u201d neurobiological pathways in different directions, resulting in phenotypic differences mediated by the same pathways (\n35). By applying statistical tools that allow for mixed effect directions and estimation of effect sizes, new insight into neurobiological substrates for mental disorders is possible.\nThese findings also have clinical implications. First, evidence of extensive genetic overlap with limited trait specificity underscores the limited extent to which our current categorical diagnostic system maps onto underlying biological processes (\n36). These findings may therefore be more consistent with dimensional approaches to psychiatric nosology, which allow for specific combinations of symptoms as well as interactions with other mental traits, as proposed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) or Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) frameworks (\n37,", "Acknowledgments", "Using bivariate MiXeR, we found extensive genetic overlap across mental disorders and cognitive and personality traits. This pattern was present in scenarios of weak genome-wide genetic correlation, such as depression and cognition, as well as strong genome-wide correlations, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The former is indicative of a balance of shared variants with concordant and discordant effect directions on each trait, a pattern we replicate using LAVA. These findings build on previous evidence demonstrating extensive genetic overlap between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and intelligence, with widespread mixed effect directions (\n11,", ". This indicates that MiXeR-modeled estimates of genetic overlap are indistinguishable from maximum overlap as measured by AIC, and so must be interpreted with caution. It is important to note, however, that the overlaps presented are still the best-fitting estimates as determined by maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, given the need to maximize sample sizes, it was not possible to perform replication analyses in independent samples. Nonetheless, we used both MiXeR and LAVA to triangulate our findings using different statistical frameworks. Our univariate measures are further supported by recent findings using Fourier mixture regression (", "g is a genome-wide summary measure, it does not differentiate genetic overlap with a mixture of concordant and discordant effects from an absence of genetic overlap, returning an estimate close to 0 in both scenarios (\nFigure 1A). It is necessary to capture this \u201cmissing dimension\u201d of genetic overlap to comprehensively describe the shared genetic underpinnings of polygenic mental disorders (\n17). Overlap despite minimal genetic correlation may indicate shared molecular mechanisms, with implications for how we conceptualize genetic risk for mental disorders.\nThe bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) (\n19) and LAVA (\n20) can shed light on this \u201cmissing dimension.\u201d MiXeR circumvents the need to identify all \u201ccausal\u201d variants by inferring the total number of \u201ccausal\u201d variants for each trait (univariate) and the total number of shared and unique \u201ccausal\u201d variants for a pair of traits (bivariate) (\n19). MiXeR also estimates the genetic correlation of shared variants (r", "In summary, we have used advanced statistical modeling to demonstrate both considerable similarities yet also fundamental differences in the genetic architecture of ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression, alongside cognitive and personality traits. Despite extensive genetic overlap and few trait-specific variants, there were distinct patterns of genetic correlations with widespread mixed effect directions. This suggests that it is the specific distribution of effect sizes of highly pleiotropic variants that predominantly contribute to the development of mental disorders and related traits, rather than a set of disorder-specific variants.

Approximately 107,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2021, and 37% of these deaths involved simultaneous exposure to both opioids and stimulant drugs. Drug use and addiction represent a public health crisis, characterized by high social, emotional, and financial costs to families, communities, and society.", "While Hatoum and colleagues have identified a genetic pattern indicating broad addiction risk, they note that substance use-specific diagnoses still have meaning. \u201cThe current study validates previous findings of alcohol-specific risk variants, and, importantly, makes this finding in a very large and more diverse study population,\u201d said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. \u201cThe finding of shared genetic risk variants across different substance use disorders provides insight into some of the mechanisms that underlie these disorders and the relationships with other mental health conditions. Together the findings of alcohol-specific risk variants and common addiction-related variants provide powerful support for individualized prevention and treatment.\u201d\nFor more information on substance and mental health treatment programs in your area, call the free and confidential National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or visit www.FindTreatment.gov .\nReference", "About the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA): NIDA is a component of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Kvaale, Gottdiener, and Haslam (2013) synthesized 28 studies that investigated how experimentally manipulated explanations influenced stigmatizing attitudes, and Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) reviewed 25 correlational studies of associations between explanations and stigma. Both meta-analyses examined multiple dimensions of stigma \u2013 blame directed at sufferers, desire for social distance from them, perceptions of them as dangerous or unpredictable, and pessimism about their recovery \u2013 and included studies published prior to November 2012 and October 2011, respectively", ". Thus, when members of the public ascribe a mental disorder to a brain abnormality or a \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d they may not be making an essentialist explanation to the same degree as when they ascribe it to a genetic mutation. As Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2011b) suggest, \u201cit would be interesting and informative to compare the magnitude of essentialist biases between genetic concepts and other potential essence placeholders such as neurological mechanisms\u201d (p.830). The literature has rapidly expanded since the existing meta-analytic study of the correlational relationship between biogenetic explanations and stigma (Kvaale, Haslam, & Gottdiener, 2013), which conducted some preliminary comparisons between neurobiological and genetic explanations, and no quantitative review has addressed the effects on stigma of experimentally inducing neurobiological causal beliefs.", "Genetic and other biological explanations appear to have mixed blessings for the stigma of mental disorder. Meta-analytic evidence shows that these \u201cbiogenetic\u201d explanations reduce the blame attached to sufferers, but they also increase aversion, perceptions of dangerousness, and pessimism about recovery. These relationships may arise because biogenetic explanations recruit essentialist intuitions, which have known associations with prejudice and the endorsement of stereotypes. However, the adverse implications of biogenetic explanations as a set may not hold true for the subset of those explanations that invoke neurobiological causes. Neurobiological explanations might have less adverse implications for stigma than genetic explanations, for example, because they are arguably less essentialist. Although this possibility is important for evaluating the social implications of neuroscientific explanations of mental health problems, it has yet to be tested meta-analytically", "The present meta-analytic study therefore aimed to clarify whether neurobiological explanations \u2013 those based on popular reception of neuroscientific research \u2013 have the same mixed implications for stigma as the broad class of biogenetic explanations. The study partially replicated the two meta-analyses of Kvaale and colleagues. Like the work of Kvaale et al., the present study reports two meta-analyses, one a meta-analysis of studies in which neurobiological explanations were experimentally manipulated and their effects on stigma were observed, and the other a meta-analysis of studies where endorsement of these explanations was correlated with measures of stigma. These two types of study generate effect-size metrics that cannot be directly compared, necessitating two separate meta-analyses, the findings of which are presented separately in the \u201cResults\u201d section", "Study design and measures\nThe eligible studies measured or presented a variety of neurobiological explanations including brain disease or dysfunction or chemical imbalance (see Table 1). Effects within these studies that pertained to other types of biogenetic explanations (e.g., genes, heredity) were not included in the analyses.", "To be included in the meta-analysis, articles had to (1) be written in English or German, (2) report findings from a plausible and empirically checked experimental manipulation of belief in neurobiological explanations for psychological difficulties or report correlational association(s) between endorsement of neurobiological explanations and stigma in the context of mental disorder, (3) report an effect of neurobiological explanations (e.g., brain disorder/chemical imbalance) on one of the four relevant categories of stigma measures (blame; perceptions of dangerousness; desire for social distance; prognostic pessimism), and (4) report sufficient statistical information for an effect size to be calculated. Studies were excluded if biological explanations were limited to genetic or unspecified biological causes rather than to neurobiological causes", "These issues are especially germane to the field of psychiatry, where neuroscience has become the royal road to understanding mental disorders. Research on the neurobiological dimensions of psychiatric conditions outstrips research on its psychosocial dimensions, and treatments that target brain chemistry are increasingly dominant. With the advent of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (Cuthbert, 2015), psychiatric classification is shrugging off its reputation for ignoring causation and is making direct reference to underlying neurobiological mechanisms of disorder. Mental health is the second most common domain in which neuroscience receives media coverage (O\u2019Connor, Rees, & Joffe, 2012), and research shows that laypeople increasingly endorsed neurobiological explanationsFootnote 1 for mental health problems over the period 1990 to 2006 (Schomerus et al., 2012)", "SCOPUS search terms\n( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( biological OR biogenetic OR genetic ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( \"mental disorder\" OR \"mental illness\" ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( stigma OR \"social distance\" OR danger* OR fear OR blame OR anger OR hopelessness OR \"poor prognosis\" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2017 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2016 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2015 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2014 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2013 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2012 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2011 ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"ar\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"re\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"ch\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"ed\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"sh\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"ip\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"no\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"le\" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , \"er\" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE , \"English\" ) ).\nRights and permissions", ".

Thus, even if the neuroscientific explanations for mental disorder that are generated by researchers are not intrinsically essentialist, when they are refracted through the lens of psychological essentialism by laypeople they may become so.

These findings suggest that laypeople apprehend neuroscientific research findings with an essentialist bias that leads them to ascribe mental health problems to fixed and unchanging pathological essences. The study has implications for how neuroscientific research findings on mental health should be communicated so as to minimize adverse effects on stigma.", ". However, laypeople may understand the brain differently: as a mysterious seat of the soul whose abnormalities determine the person\u2019s fate and identity. They may think of the neural bases of mental disorders as discrete and localized lesions, perhaps encouraged by the tendency for media reports of neuroscientific findings to invoke specific brain regions. When they understand depression or schizophrenia as \u201cbrain diseases\u201d they may liken these conditions to degenerative diseases such as dementia, which do have a pessimistic prognosis and seem to determine and disrupt personal identity, or to traumatic conditions that are equally deep and enduring in their effects. Similarly, when laypeople endorse \u201cchemical imbalances\u201d as explanations of mental ill-health they may apprehend them as deep-seated and enduring defects that can be palliated by medication but never cured", "Conclusions\nOur findings indicate that explanations of mental health problems that invoke the brain have some problematic implications for the public\u2019s attitudes towards people who experience them. People who tend to explain psychiatric conditions as brain diseases or as products of chemical imbalances may be especially likely to avoid sufferers and are just as likely as others to blame them for their problems. People who are given a neurobiological explanation of a psychiatric condition tend to see sufferers as more dangerous and less likely to recover, and are more likely to distance themselves from them, than people who are not. Neuroscientific explanations might appear to hold promise as ways to destigmatize mental health problems, representing them as biomedical illnesses rather than as personal weaknesses or taints, but the public reception of them \u2013 and perhaps their reception by professionals as well (Lebowitz & Ahn, 2014) \u2013 sometimes seems to have the opposite effect.", "Method\nSystematic review and study selection\nStudies included in this review were obtained as part of a larger systematic review of mental disorder stigma (publication in progress), and comprised an updated search and analysis of two articles published in 2013 (Kvaale, Gottdiener, & Haslam, 2013; Kvaale, Haslam, & Gottdiener, 2013). A comprehensive search for relevant articles was conducted in February and updated in October 2017 using the PsycINFO, Medline and PubMed databases. Search terms can be found in \u201cAppendix\u201d. One author (AL) determined eligibility at the title/abstract level, and both authors assessed eligibility from full-text and extracted data. The final sample of 26 articles included 17 that had been included in the Kvaale, Gottdiener, and Haslam (2013), Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) meta-analyses and 9 new studies.", "Three explanations might be offered for particular aspects of the findings. First, it could be argued that the failure to detect significant aggregate effects in some analyses at least partially reflects low statistical power. Because neurobiological explanations are a subset of biogenetic explanations, analyses restricted to the former may not have been powerful enough to detect the absence of negative relationships between neurobiological explanations and blame, for example. It is true that fewer studies were included in the present experimental meta-analysis than in Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) \u2013 a mean of 4.0 studies per analysis, compared to 13.75 \u2013 and this may have prevented the trend for blame to be negatively related to neurobiological explanations to reach significance, as it did in the earlier meta-analysis", ". Despite the overall consistency, it must also be noted that the experimental meta-analyses yielded much stronger evidence for relationships between neurobiological explanation and stigma than the correlational meta-analyses, despite including fewer primary studies. This difference may reflect the many confounding factors and moderator variables present in correlational studies of stigma (e.g., Kvaale & Haslam, 2016) that may hamper the detection of relationships. In view of the superiority of experimental designs in detecting causal relationships, the stronger evidence for the adverse effects of neurobiological explanation on stigma in the experimental meta-analyses is a reason for confidence in those effects.", "We use the term \u201cneurobiological explanation\u201d to refer to explanations invoking causes that explicitly or implicitly implicate the nervous system (e.g., brain disease or dysfunction, neurochemistry). This usage includes explanations endorsed by laypeople that lack specificity or scientific basis (e.g., \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d). In contrast, we refer to \u201cneuroscientific explanations\u201d to refer to explanations involving neurobiological causes that are propounded by neuroscientists. We use the expression \u201cbiogenetic explanation\u201d as an umbrella term that encompasses many forms of biological explanation, including neurobiological explanation as one form but also including explanations invoking genetic influences and unspecified biological explanations that are neither neurobiological nor genetic.\nReferences\n*Studies used in the meta-analyses", ". The same meta-analysis that tracked growth in biogenetic causal beliefs also revealed that public acceptance of people with schizophrenia declined during the same period, and acceptance of depressed people was unchanged (Schomerus et al., 2012). It is therefore important to determine whether laypeople\u2019s endorsement of biogenetic explanations for mental disorder have positive, negative, or mixed implications for stigma.", "The mixed-blessings model of psychiatric stigma proposes that biogenetic explanations combine positive (de-stigmatizing) and negative (stigmatizing) implications, the latter due to a tendency for laypeople to understand \u2013 or misunderstand \u2013 biogenetic causes in an essentialist manner. Such a tendency is highly plausible for genetic causes, where essentialist thinking and its link to prejudice are well-documented. Genes are popularly understood to be discrete, hidden, fixed, and identity-determining to the point where DNA has become a colloquial synonym for essence. Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2011a) have reviewed at length the destructive social implications of genetic essentialism, and Keller (2006) and others have demonstrated its association with racial prejudice. However, genetic causes are only a subset of the broader set of biogenetic causes, and it is not self-evident that other biological causes are understood in equally essentialist ways by laypeople", ". If they are not understood in this way, these non-genetic biological explanations for mental health problems may not have the adverse implications for stigma predicted by the mixed-blessings model.", ". None of these conclusions was reliably qualified by psychiatric condition, although relatively few studies have examined any specific condition, especially those other than depression and schizophrenia. Careful inspection of the study by Speerforck, Schomerus, Pruess, and Angermeyer (2014), which generated two outlying effects, failed to yield an explanation of why the effects might be spurious. As both meta-analytic effects were non-significant and weakly trending in the direction of the outliers, removal of those outliers, which is contrary to the spirit of meta-analysis, would not have altered the overall findings.", ". There were insufficient studies to allow meaningful comparison of different types of biogenetic explanation (genetic, general biological, or neurobiological), so all types were aggregated.", ". We present meta-analyses of links between neurobiological explanations and multiple dimensions of stigma in 26 correlational and experimental studies. In correlational studies, neurobiological explanations were marginally associated with greater desire for social distance from people with mental health problems. In experimental studies, these explanations were associated with greater desire for social distance, greater perceived dangerousness, and greater prognostic pessimism. Neurobiological explanations were not linked to reduced blame in either set of studies. By implication, neurobiological explanations have the same adverse links to stigma as other forms of biogenetic explanation. These findings raise troubling implications about the public impact of psychiatric neuroscience research findings. Although such findings are not intrinsically stigmatizing, they may become so when viewed through the lens of neuroessentialism.", ". The present study differs from Kvaale, Gottdiener, and Haslam (2013) and Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) in the primary studies that it meta-analyzed: it only included the subset of the Kvaale et al. studies that specifically examined neurobiological explanations, and also included studies of these explanations that were published in the five or more years since the 2011 and 2012 cutoffs for the Kvaale, Gottdiener, and Haslam (2013) and Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) investigations. The present study made no predictions about whether neurobiological explanations would have the same or different relationships with stigma as the broader class of biogenetic explanations. If the same pattern of relationships were obtained then neurobiological explanations would have the same problematic implications for stigma as other biogenetic explanations.", ". Two studies with explanations that did not explicitly refer to the brain or nervous system but were judged to imply specific effects on neurobiology (i.e., having a nervous breakdown as a result of a \u201cdisease \u2026 which affected my biochemistry or metabolism\u201d (Mehta & Farina, 1997) and \u201cvirus or infection\u201d (Jorm & Griffiths, 2008)) were included. Exclusion of these two studies would have made no difference to the significance levels of findings presented here. Studies were also excluded, if experimental manipulations of neurobiological explanations were combined with other anti-stigma measures, if stigma measures did not specify the nature of the stigma, and if data were not suitable for incorporation into the meta-analysis. Corresponding authors were contacted when the data format was not suitable for meta-analysis.", "Operational definitions of the four stigma constructs were as per Kvaale, Gottdiener, and Haslam (2013), as follows. \u201cBlame\u201d refers to any outcome relating to a feeling of responsibility, blame, or anger towards the person with the mental disorder. \u201cPerceived dangerousness\u201d refers to any measure of dangerousness, fear, unpredictability or risk to self/others. \u201cSocial distance\u201d refers to unwillingness to enter social relationships with individuals experiencing mental disorder. \u201cPrognostic pessimism\u201d refers to pessimism about chance of recovery, long duration for improvement, or ability of the individual to manage their problems. Outcome measures varied between studies. Where more than one outcome was reported for a single construct within the same study, the results were averaged.

Kvaale, Haslam, and Gottdiener (2013) found a null relationship between biogenetic explanations and desire for social distance in experimental studies, but the present study found a positive relationship in such studies, which provide the best evidence that neurobiological explanations have a causative effect in psychiatric stigma.", "The second set of meta-analyses synthesized the 19 correlational studies. There were 9 studies that yielded effect seizes for the blame component of stigma, 17 for social distance, and 11 for perceived dangerousness. No studies investigated associations with the prognostic pessimism component of stigma. The findings are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 3. Although these meta-analyses contained more studies than the experimental meta-analyses, in contrast to those analyses, none of them yielded aggregate effects that reached conventional levels of significance. Endorsement of neurobiological explanations was not associated with greater or lesser blame (r = .039, p = .804), but it was marginally associated with a greater desire for social distance (r = .101, p = .058), and non-significantly associated with greater perceived dangerousness (r = .138, p = .257)", "Reflecting on this evidence that biogenetic explanations of psychopathology are double-edged swords, Haslam and Kvaale (2015) proposed the \u201cmixed-blessings\u201d model of stigma. The model proposes that biogenetic explanations reduce one form of stigma by promoting attributions of personal uncontrollability. The sufferer\u2019s problems are ascribed to a biological abnormality over which they have no control, disarming any tendency to hold them responsible and blameworthy for their unusual behavior and experience. However, the model argues that the same explanations simultaneously increase other forms of stigma by recruiting an essentialist mode of thinking. Research on psychological essentialism indicates that people commonly believe that a deep-seated hidden essence is shared by all members of a category, giving rise to its observable properties and determining its identity", ". Essentialist beliefs about social categories, which intuit a hidden essence that grounds group membership, often have adverse implications. They have been shown to be associated with prejudice (e.g., Haslam & Levy, 2006), avoidance of outgroups (Williams & Eberhardt, 2008), and endorsement of group stereotypes (Bastian & Haslam, 2006). Researchers have documented essentialist beliefs in laypeople\u2019s thinking about mental disorder (Ahn, Flanagan, Marsh, & Sanislow, 2006; Haslam & Ernst, 2002). Thus, if people understand biogenetic causes of mental disorder categories to be discrete, deep-seated, and unchanging pathological essences, this understanding may have unfortunate consequences (Howell, Weikum, & Dyck, 2011). Because the essence is discrete, the affected person is viewed as categorically different from normality, encouraging social distance. Because the pathological essence is fixed, essentialist thinking implies prognostic pessimism", "A new meta-analytic review of the literature on the links between neurobiological explanations and stigma is therefore sorely needed. If neurobiological explanations are importantly different from other biogenetic explanations \u2013 if they are less essentialist, for example \u2013 they may not have the same adverse implications for stigma as those other explanation types, such as explanations invoking genes and heredity. If neurobiological explanations were found not to be associated with greater stigma, in contrast to the findings obtained for biogenetic explanations as a whole, this would provide reassurance that the growing public acceptance of psychiatric neuroscience is unlikely to have negative implications for attitudes towards the mentally ill. If, on the other hand, neurobiological explanations show the same links to stigma as have been demonstrated in past research on biogenetic explanations in general, then that growing public acceptance may have troubling social implications.", "Ahn, W., Flanagan, E.

By this account, laypeople may hold negative beliefs about people whose problems are given neurobiological explanations for reasons that have little to do with the hidden, deep-seated, or fixed nature of the supposed causes. Neurobiological explanations may elicit desire for social distance and fear, for example, because people believe these explanations imply that the affected person is not in control of her own actions.

First, the number of studies included is relatively modest, limiting the power of some statistical tests of aggregate effect sizes. This limitation is only partial, with three of the seven effects examined reaching conventional levels of statistical significance, and it is likely to be overcome in future as additional studies accumulate. Second, and relatedly, study numbers were too small to allow us to examine whether effects vary systematically across different populations (e.g., healthy participants, people experiencing mental disorders, mental health professionals). Third, all of the experimental studies included in our meta-analyses compared neurobiological explanations to psychosocial explanations, making it difficult to infer the direct rather than comparative influence of neurobiological explanation on stigma. Future research should attempt to disentangle these two forms of explanation", "This troubling conclusion has implications for how the findings of psychiatric neuroscience should be communicated. Such findings are seductive (Weisberg et al., 2008) and they are also prone to be apprehended in biased ways. Mindful that neurobiological explanations may be misunderstood in an essentialist fashion \u2013 as picking out a discrete, unalterable, and identity-determining defect \u2013 neuroscientists should take pains to counteract rather than play into these neuroessentialist distortions.

Participants induced to endorse neurobiological explanations for mental health problems did not blame affected persons more or less (g = \u2212 0.240, p = .349), but they desired significantly more social distance from them (g = 0.216, p = .045), perceived them as significantly more dangerous (g = 0.254, p = .02), and were more pessimistic about their recovery (g = 0.323, p = .018).

Experimental studies should also aim to directly compare the effects on stigma of different kinds of biogenetic explanation.", "Neurobiological explanations \u2013 those that invoke causes involving the nervous system \u2013 are a particularly important comparison case to genetic explanations. Some writers (Haslam, 2011; Racine, Waldman, Rosenberg, & Illes, 2010) argue that the public sometimes comprehends neurobiological causes in essentialist ways, coining the term \u201cneuroessentialism.\u201d However, although laypeople may understand genes as causally potent essences that are discrete and static, they may understand brain phenomena in less binary and more dynamic ways, encouraged perhaps by popular writing on neural plasticity. Similarly, they may judge genes to be deep, \u201cultimate\u201d causes whereas neurobiological causes may be judged to operate at a more intermediate level, in between ultimate causes and overt behavior and experience", "Discussion", "A second explanation addresses the pattern of adverse links between neurobiological explanations and stigma obtained in the present study. The consistency of this pattern is perhaps surprising, given that neurobiological explanations might seem to be less essentialist than some other biogenetic explanations, such as those involving genetic causes. Arguably neurobiological explanations are not, in fact, less likely than genetic or other biological explanations to invoke essentialist thinking among the lay public. Neuroscientists may have nonessentialist understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in mental health problems, recognizing that these mechanisms are not discrete but continuous with normality; that they are not localized as pathological essences but distributed in complex networks; and that they are intrinsically plastic rather than fixed and deterministic", "Background\nHow people respond to neuroscientific explanations is emerging as a dynamic field of research in cognitive psychology. Researchers have explored why these explanations have a particular allure relative to mentalistic explanations (Weisberg, Keil, Goodstein, Rawson, & Gray, 2008), and isolated some of the processes that account for that allure (Hopkins, Weisberg, & Taylor, 2016). Other researchers have explored the role of neuroscientific explanations in moral judgments such as sentencing decisions (Aspinwall, Brown, & Tabery, 2012), how framing behavior concretely versus abstractly influences judgments of the plausibility of neuroscientific explanations for behavior (Kim, Johnson, Ahn, & Knobe, 2017), and how essentialist reasoning may underpin some of these effects (Ahn, Flanagan, Marsh, & Sanislow, 2006).

Although it is theoretically plausible that laypeople\u2019s neurobiological explanations might be less essentialistic than their genetic explanations \u2013 less deep-seated, less discrete, and less fixed \u2013 these neurobiological explanations appear to be linked to multiple components of stigma in ways that are every bit as problematic as genetic explanations, if not more so.

At the same time, mental health problems continue to be heavily stigmatized and there are few signs that this stigma is abating. It has been argued that biological explanations might play a role in reducing psychiatric stigma, but the evidence to date indicates that they are a double-edged sword, reducing some forms of stigma but exacerbating others. However, no previous studies have examined how the narrower set of neurobiological explanations are linked to stigma, and whether they might have less adverse links to stigma than other forms of biological explanation (e.g., genetic explanations)", ". The links between neurobiological explanations and stigma found in the present study may therefore point to specific, control-related elements of these explanations that may not be shared with other kinds of biogenetic explanation. Further research is need to ascertain the degree to which links between neurobiological explanation and stigma are grounded in essentialist thinking.", "The findings of the present study were broadly consistent internally and with previous meta-analyses.

Neurobiological explanations were significantly associated with greater perceived dangerousness in the experimental meta-analysis and although there was no significant relationship in the correlational meta-analysis the trend was in the same direction.

The field of psychiatric genetics is haunted by memories of the eugenics movement of the early 1900s, which targeted psychiatric patients and others considered \u201cgenetically inferior\u201d for forced sterilization and death (9\u201312).Even strong proponents of genetic research may feel some ...", "snippets": ["28). Patient-centered safeguards, such as confidentiality protections, careful attention to the informed consent process, and genetic counseling, were put in place to protect individuals against potential harms and to enhance autonomous decision making (\n13). Thorny ethical issues arising in specific testing contexts were identified and described, such as the person with a known predisposition to HD who refuses to disclose this information to family members (\n29,\n30), parents who seek to have minor children tested for adult-onset conditions with no preventive treatment (\n31\u2013\n33), or pregnant couples wishing to obtain prenatal testing and abortion for a mild genetic disability that does not preclude a satisfactory quality of life (\n16,\n17).\nHighly penetrant disorders are rare in the overall population, however, and they are not necessarily good models for understanding either the genetics or the \u201cgenethics\u201d of the vast burden of human illnesses (", "99). Pharmacogenetic testing for variants of this gene is now clinically available as an aid in selecting an antidepressant treatment (\n100). The serotonin transporter gene has also been associated, however, with a large number of psychiatric syndromes. In the future, information that had been sought solely for pharmacogenetic purposes may yield unwanted and unanticipated information about the risk of other conditions (\n97).\nA third ethical issue that derives from the newness of the psychiatric genome era is that it is unclear who should bear ethical and legal responsibility for its clinical applications. On one hand, most psychiatrists are not trained in genetic counseling and testing (\n101\u2013\n103) and do not seem prepared to provide these services (\n54,\n101,\n102). On the other hand, the current number of certified genetic counselors and fellowship-trained clinical geneticists is likely to be too small to meet the projected need for future counseling and testing (", "As we have seen, most of the published data that are directly pertinent to psychiatric genetics ethics concern clinical, rather than research, ethics, and most of these studies consist of questionnaire surveys of patients, families, and clinicians regarding interest in genetic testing. Most surveys polled small convenience samples, which limits the generalizability of their results. Some early studies assessed opinions about scenarios that now appear moot, such as 100% predictive genetic testing for a common psychiatric disorder or in utero gene therapy to prevent such an illness. Meanwhile, attitudes toward the most feasible form of psychiatric genetic testing\u2014pharmacogenetic\u2014have only rarely been assessed. Investigators in this field have obviously been chasing a moving target over the past two decades.", "113). An important difference between HIV testing and susceptibility testing for psychiatric illness, however, is that HIV-testing kits have high positive and negative predictive power, indicating less need to be concerned about the misinterpretation of test results. Another difference is the public health importance of knowing one's HIV status, enabling people to benefit from available treatment and to take steps to avoid infecting others; there are no similar benefits to psychiatric genetic testing at this time.\nFinally, new and innovative technologies tend to be costly, which raises the ethical issue of distributive justice and the equitable distribution of social benefits and burdens. If clinical genotyping proves efficacious, it is unclear what the impact will be on existing health care disparities in the United States (\n114).\nDISCUSSION\nAnalyzing ethical considerations in psychiatric genetic research and testing", "These data suggest that learning one has a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d genotype may have a more profound psychological impact than learning one's absolute risk of illness. Consistent with this notion was a finding that participants in the intervention arm were better able to recall their genotype than their absolute risk assessment at 1 year after the intervention (\n65).\nGenetic discrimination\nFor more than a decade, concerns have been mounting about the potential misuse of genetic data to discriminate against individuals in insurance and employment. A survey published in\nScience in 1996 described the incidence of discrimination among 332 individuals who belonged to genetics support groups (", "One of the most well-designed and generalizable studies on this topic was Phelan's (", "Table 2). Using current clinical practice as a descriptive guide, these authors categorized ethical considerations on the basis of the predictive power of a genetic test and the availability and acceptability of medical treatments for the condition (\n26). According to this framework, we would expect that the first susceptibility tests for most common mental illnesses would be categorized as low in predictive power and as lacking acceptable medical interventions, because of a dearth of evidence regarding the utility of preventive interventions. For such tests, according to the framework of Burke et al, the dominant ethical consideration would be nonmaleficence\u2014that is, to do no harm by withholding the test until it could be established that an individual would have a favorable risk/benefit ratio.\nOther experts (", "50) found that they most often mentioned insurance discrimination as a risk associated with genetic testing for that illness. Finally, a disturbing case series published in 2001 documented employment discrimination against three young men in Hong Kong who had applied for civil service jobs and were rejected or fired on the basis of a first-degree family history of schizophrenia (\n72). However, a 2004 review of the work of 50 researchers studying genetic influences on substance abuse and on psychiatric disorders found no adverse effects such as misuse of data or loss of confidentiality (unpublished data of J. F. Cubells et al. 2004).\nAs a response to the perceived injustice of discrimination based on genotype, most states have enacted some form of antidiscrimination legislation, and a federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, was enacted in 2008 (", "20) have suggested that such a system should incorporate not only the medical benefits, but also the possibility of psychosocial risks\u2014which seems particularly apt in the case of psychiatric genetics. A more detailed framework would encompass all these elements plus factor in the newness of the test, the testing circumstance (i.e., academic setting, private clinic, DTC), and the test's purpose (i.e., susceptibility, diagnostic, pharmacogenetic, prenatal, newborn screening). Thus, tests would be categorized according to their predictive power, purposes, availability of acceptable interventions, level of stigma of the condition, likely psychological impact of the condition, possibility of negative effects on third parties, availability of safeguards, and newness of the test (", "104). Furthermore, the genetics professionals may not feel adequately trained to work with psychiatric patients (\n105). Increased education and training in psychiatric genetics appears necessary for both groups. A multidisciplinary approach to clinical care, involving both psychiatrists and genetic counselors, has also been suggested (\n103).\nIt is possible that the emerging phenomenon of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing via Internet laboratories may move psychiatric testing out of the clinic entirely (\n106\u2013\n108). DTC genetic testing is now available for a variety of purposes\u2014paternity testing, ancestry tracing, pharmacogenetic testing, and even whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping to \u201chelp you read and understand your DNA.\u201d (\n109)\nDTC genetic testing is legal in many states, and there is little federal oversight, although professional groups such as the American Society for Human Genetics have raised many concerns (", "In theory, psychosocial effects may be especially strong in the case of psychiatric disorders. Mental illnesses affect emotions, cognitions, and behavior; as such, they may seem more inextricably bound to one's personhood than disorders that are exclusively somatic. Given the pervasive stigma of mental illness, people who are thought to be susceptible to these disorders may be more vulnerable to discrimination and stigmatization. Furthermore, because many psychiatric disorders begin in young adulthood, genetic information about disease susceptibility may be obtained relatively early in life, with unknown results on an individual's developing sense of self and future prospects. The sections below will consider empirical evidence regarding the likely quality and magnitude of three types of psychosocial effects in psychiatric genetics\u2014psychological consequences, insurance and employment discrimination, and social stigmatization.\nPsychological consequences", "74). In theory, denying the same information to insurance providers would place insurers at a financial disadvantage because they could not adjust premiums to account for different levels of genetic risk. Furthermore, without the ability to make such adjustments, insurers could not charge lower premiums for individuals who have beneficial genotypes. Ironically, this inability to adjust premiums could unfairly burden people who have a strong family history of illness but for whom genetic testing indicates reduced personal risk (\n75).", "Table 3). This cluster of factors is dependent upon the test, the point in time, the disorder, the testing circumstances, and the characteristics of the individual being tested, the last of which may affect the predictive power of the test, the likelihood that third parties will be affected, and the vulnerability to psychosocial harms.", "21,\n22), will not be addressed. Finally, because in 2010, the ethics of psychiatric genetics provokes far more questions than answers, this article will conclude by identifying several topics for future research.\nGENETICS AS A PREDICTOR OF FUTURE HEALTH\nSince the 1980s, molecular genetics researchers have found more than 1,000 mutations associated with highly penetrant genetic disorders such as HD, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy (\n7). These triumphs of gene finding have been followed by the availability of clinical genetic testing to detect carrier status and to predict whether at-risk individuals actually develop disease. During the early days of gene-finding research, media reporters, experts, and public figures tended to describe DNA in awe-inspiring, even mystical terms, for example, as the \u201ccode of life,\u201d the \u201cbook of life,\u201d \u201ccentral to our core\u201d (\n20), \u201cuniquely powerful and uniquely personal\u201d (\n23), \u201cthe language in which God created man\u201d (\n24), and a \u201cfuture diary\u201d (", "According to this method of analysis, a newly developed DTC susceptibility genetic test that is poorly predictive and for a condition that lacks intervention and is highly stigmatized should raise many more red flags than an established, highly predictive diagnostic test offered by well-trained clinicians for a condition that is less stigmatized and for which preventive treatment is available. Some might say that the former test should be withheld entirely on the principle of nonmaleficence, whereas others might believe it overly paternalistic to do so if informed consent procedures could be established to ensure that individuals being tested fully understood and accepted the implications.", "How can informed consent be best achieved, given the probabilistic nature of test results and the possibility of secondary information arising in the future?\n\u2022.\nWhat safeguards, such as confidentiality protections and pre- and posttest counseling, are necessary to protect individuals from psychosocial harms?\n\u2022.\nWhat is the appropriate role of psychiatrists and other clinicians in providing genetic counseling and testing?\nAs we have seen, the empirical evidence base on ethically relevant considerations in psychiatric genetics is almost exclusively focused on clinical, rather than research, ethics. The following questions (among others) need to be addressed regarding the ethics of psychiatric genetic research:\n\u2022.\nHow can research benefits be maximized and risks minimized for individuals, populations, and communities that participate in genetic studies of psychiatric disorders, given the social stigma of these conditions?\n\u2022.", "35), although genotyping alone will never provide results with 100% power because of the contributions of environment and epigenetic factors.\nThe lack of certainty associated with susceptibility genotyping is likely to engender a number of ethical dilemmas. For example, in the future it may be possible to use genotyping in the research context to help identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing mental disorders. Such individuals may then be enrolled into protocols designed to test interventions to prevent or ameliorate disease. The potential benefits of this line of research are tremendous, but they must be balanced against the risks of genetic labeling. For example, a child who is considered to be at elevated risk for schizophrenia may be viewed negatively by others, and the effects of this knowledge on the developing sense of self may be devastating. More well-known risks include the harms associated with any interventions provided to high-risk individuals (\n36\u2013", "40). Results of this test were to provide risk estimates for bipolar disorder of 2% or 3% (versus 1% at baseline). Other psychiatric genetic tests have been proposed as well (\n41).\nThe ethical implications of the commercialization of psychiatric genotyping will be discussed later in this article. For now, we will consider difficulties particular to working with probabilistic tests, such as the hurdles that must be overcome to ensure informed consent and to avoid misinterpretation of tests. A growing literature suggests that patients' interpretation of risk estimates is extraordinarily complex (\n42\u2013", "59) Early survey instruments tended to present psychiatric genetics in highly deterministic terms, but later work has emphasized the probabilistic nature of genetic testing. If we consider only the studies that specifically mentioned that psychiatric susceptibility testing might not be 100% predictive, the data still demonstrate that patients and families see a substantial benefit to genetic testing for the purposes of life planning and early diagnosis (\n49,\n50,\n53,\n55,\n56,\n58). Patients and families appear to be more focused on the perceived benefits of testing and less focused on the risks than clinicians or researchers (\n56). This disparity may be the result of the layperson's lack of awareness of the risks of genetic testing. It may also be that individuals who have intimate experience in living with mental illness are more attuned to the benefits of information that could guide treatment or future plans.", "14). To some bioethicists, the emerging importance of this issue has suggested a need to reconceptualize the dominant ethical considerations in genetic research from autonomy-based ethics to a more communitarian ethics that focuses on the risks and benefits of research for communities and populations rather than for individual participants (\n14).\nGENETICS AND THE ETHICS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\nPsychiatric genetics, as a body of scientific knowledge and a set of clinical activities, is far from being fully mature. There is scientific consensus that the common mental disorders are heritable and that a number of genetic variants are likely to be involved in most illnesses (\n7), but there is no firm consensus about which specific genes are associated with which mental illnesses, with the exception of\nAPOE and AD (", "46) influenced by cognitive, affective, and cultural factors. We know very little about how individuals will understand and act upon the results of tests that provide subtle information about the risk of highly stigmatized disorders. Furthermore, moral questions arise about what level of absolute risk increase is sufficient for specific applications, such as prenatal testing or clinical susceptibility testing to aid life planning.\nExisting empirical evidence sheds some light on one aspect of this issue: how the probabilistic nature of genetic information may affect consumer interest in genetic testing. A number of investigators have surveyed patients and families about their attitudes toward genetic testing for psychiatric illnesses and have generally found keen interest in clinical genotyping (\n47\u2013", "After a review of empirical literature that speaks to these four characteristics of psychiatric genetics, this review will present two conceptual frameworks that can be used to systematically analyze the ethics of psychiatric genetic research and clinical genotyping. Throughout this article, the emphasis will be on ethical considerations arising from today's technology, rather than the morality of less immediate applications such as new diagnostic classification systems or highly speculative applications such as germ-line manipulation through genetic engineering. Because most of the literature in this field has centered on clinical genetic testing and because such tests are now becoming available, genetic testing will be a major focus of the article", "60). It is also consistent with studies of interest in testing for genetic susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (\n61).\nPSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF GENETIC INFORMATION\nThe ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence suggest that careful attention must be paid to the psychosocial effects of psychiatric genetics to maximize the personal and social benefits and to minimize the risks. Understanding these risks and benefits is also necessary to fulfill the ethical duty of respect for persons, which requires researchers and clinicians to provide information about the likely results of medical interventions to obtain fully informed consent. Finally, justice requires consideration of the potential social harms that may befall individuals and groups as a result of their participation in clinical and research activities.", "A preliminary analysis of data for 162 participants found no differences in depression or anxiety among the participants at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postintervention, and no individuals met the criteria for clinical depression or anxiety diagnoses (\n65). As a more targeted measure of the psychological sequelae of genotyping, researchers compared survey responses of a subset of 30 women in the genotype group and 36 women in the control group, all of whom were determined to have a 29% lifetime risk of AD. Even though all the women had the same absolute risk of disease, those in the genotype group (none of whom had an\nAPOE e4 risk allele) perceived their risk of AD as lower, had decreased anxiety about developing AD, and had a more positive attitude toward the risk assessment (\n67).", "85) along with technological advances that enable rapid and relatively inexpensive genotyping. Genetic protocols are becoming grander in scale (e.g., studies of genetic variation among populations of entire countries), in longitudinal sweep (protocols in which DNA is banked for future study), and in the complexity of information that they gather (genotypic data that are linked with phenotypic data, including complex and continually updated medical records). The rapid development of the \u201cgenome era\u201d of medical research has ushered in new ethical concerns (\n14,\n86\u2013\n88). Today's investigators and research participants are unlikely to anticipate all future research uses of genetic material in stored samples, for example, and there is as yet no firm consensus about whether and how informed consent should be obtained for future projects (\n89\u2013", "65) of susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease demonstrates that ethically important considerations can be assessed using the gold standard of protocol designs, the randomized controlled trial. The REVEAL study also suggests that the psychological risks of susceptibility testing may be lower, and the benefits higher, than previously expected, at least for highly educated individuals who have a family history of illness and in the context of a comprehensive program that includes pre- and posttest genetic counseling and careful attention to informed consent. As new clinical applications of psychiatric genetics become feasible, it should be possible to design prospective evaluations of the outcomes of psychiatric genetic counseling and testing, following the model of the REVEAL study. Such investigations could complement traditional \u201cempirical ethics research\u201d methods, such as focus groups, key informant interviews, and questionnaire surveys of stakeholders.", "Psychiatric genetic research is a source of great hope for many individuals with mental illness, their families, and the clinicians who care for them. In 2010, the research enterprise appears poised to begin to fulfill some of those hopes. Molecular genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia have been validated in independent samples (\n1\u2013\n5), and researchers working to find genes associated with other common complex inheritance diseases such as diabetes (\n6) have had clear successes. Many observers believe that psychiatric genetic research is on the same promising path (\n7,\n8).\nPsychiatric genetics is a complex and rapidly changing endeavor, however, and it requires a detailed and dynamic ethics (", "26) including the major psychiatric diseases, which have complex inheritance. Complex inheritance disorders, sometimes called multifactorial illnesses, are caused by a combination of at least two and perhaps hundreds of genes and nongenetic factors such as environmental and epigenetic influences (i.e., patterns of DNA methylation and histone modification) (\n34). It now appears that multiple genes are involved in the etiology of most mental disorders, each gene contributing a small amount of increased risk (\n7).\nUnlike genetic tests for highly penetrant disorders, tests for individual genetic variants associated with most cases of psychiatric disorders have been expected to have low predictive power (an absolute increase or decrease in risk on the order of a few percentage points), and the risk variants have been expected to be common in the population (\n7). Eventually, it may be possible to test for a combination of susceptibility variants to achieve much greater predictive power (", "Empirical data on this issue are limited, though the REVEAL study (described in the previous section) assessed insurance-purchasing behaviors after participants were informed of their risk of illness. Participants who learned they had one or two copies of the risk allele for Alzheimer's disease were 5.76 times more likely then those who were not told their risk status to report having changed long-term care insurance coverage at 1 year after the intervention. There were no other differences, however, in behaviors regarding life insurance or other forms of health insurance (\n76).\nStigma and the \u201cgeneticization\u201d of mental illness", "Another possibility is that consumers' interest in genetic information is related to an exaggerated sense of the risk of recurrence of mental disorders. Evidence of such an association was provided by Austin et al. (\n57) in a web-based survey of 116 family members of individuals with mental illnesses who were identified through a consumer web site regarding psychosis. Most respondents incorrectly estimated the risk for psychosis in the sibling of an affected person, with 45% overestimating the risk and 8% underestimating the risk. The investigators found that the overestimation of risk was associated with more positive views toward predictive genetic testing in general and specifically during pregnancy. This finding is consistent with the existing literature on prenatal testing for other disorders, whose uptake appears more dependent upon individuals' perception of risk than actual risk (", "15). That is, the diagnosis will appear more credible if it is based on a biological test rather than a clinical interview and more permanent if the illness arises from one's DNA. Patients may also be saddled with an additional label of \u201cgenetic deviance\u201d in addition to being categorized as mentally ill (\n78).\nAttempts to investigate these issues empirically have produced conflicting results (\n15,\n77). A vignette survey of 126 New Zealand undergraduates demonstrated that students who were given a biological and genetic explanation for schizophrenia described a person with schizophrenia as more dangerous and unpredictable than did students who were given a psychosocial explanation for the illness (\n79). An exploratory study of patients with bipolar disorder and their family members in Australia found that most believed that the genetic etiology of bipolar disorder would decrease stigma by absolving individuals of responsibility for the illness (\n55).", "14). On the most general level, psychiatric genetics describes our profession's current understanding of mental disorders as heritable and biologically mediated rather than solely the result of psychosocial influences. The field also incorporates a long history of quantitative and qualitative psychiatric genetic research, including family, twin, and adoption studies, as well as linkage analyses and association scans. Finally, psychiatric genetics describes an emerging group of clinical applications such as pharmacogenetic, diagnostic, and susceptibility genotyping. Each of these aspects of psychiatric genetics provokes numerous ethical questions\u2014ranging from how the \u201cgeneticization\u201d of mental illness will affect its stigma (\n15) to whether psychiatric genetic research should be conducted among marginalized communities to the morality of prenatal testing for susceptibility to mild and treatable mental disorders (\n16,\n17).", "In application of this model to psychiatric genetic testing, it is possible that some innovative uses of pharmacogenetic and diagnostic testing could meet all five criteria relatively quickly if appropriate safeguards are established. Of prime importance are confidentiality protections and informed consent processes that address, among other considerations, the possibility of secondary information arising in the future due to genetic pleiotropy. The innovative use of clinical susceptibility testing may be more difficult to justify ethically: in the absence of substantial new knowledge about outcomes, it may be difficult to prove either that there are unique benefits (beyond genetic risk assessment based on family history) or that the possible risks of susceptibility testing do not exceed the risks of forgoing testing.\nDirections for future research", "Many patients, families, and clinicians have expressed hope that the geneticization of mental illness will decrease its social stigma by demonstrating that these disorders are biologically mediated and that individuals should not be blamed for their illnesses. These ideas are demonstrated in public health campaigns suggesting that psychiatric disorders are \u201cillness[es] like any other[s]\u201d and in advocacy groups' definitions of mental disorders as \u201cbrain diseases\u201d (\n77). Some investigators, however, have suggested that despite potentially salutary effects on blaming, the geneticization of psychiatric disorders will worsen stigma by making the diagnostic label of mental illness \u201cstickier\u201d (", "95). There is also a lack of agreement concerning measures to protect confidentiality of study data while allowing multiple investigators access to genotypic information linked to medical records or other phenotypic data (\n86\u2013\n89). Institutional review boards may therefore lack consistent methods for evaluating informed consent forms, confidentiality protections, and other protocol elements (\n96).", "This review aims to introduce the reader to the complexity and fluidity of ethical issues in psychiatric genetics. Rather than attempting a fully comprehensive study, which has been the subject of book-length monographs (\n13,\n18), this article will focus primarily on four broad characteristics of psychiatric genetics that merit ethical attention. First, genetic information may, to a greater or lesser extent, predict a person's future health. Second, learning about one's genotype may have profound psychosocial consequences. Third, genetic information pertains to a person's biological relatives and thus can affect family members, communities, and population groups. Finally, psychiatric genetics is a rapidly evolving field. None of these characteristics is necessarily \u201cexceptional\u201d or unique to genetics (\n19,\n20), but they will provide a useful structure for teasing apart a complex set of ethical issues.", "117) have proposed that clinical innovation in psychiatry is ethically justifiable if the following conditions are met: 1) scientific evidence suggests that the innovation is uniquely beneficial; 2) there is a clinical need for the innovative treatment; 3) the possible risks of the intervention do not exceed the risks of the individual's current condition; 4) all standard efforts have been tried and failed; and 5) appropriate safeguards (such as informed consent, monitoring for adverse effects, and reevaluating the scientific evidence) are implemented. If all five conditions are met, the practice may be justified on the basis of the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and respect for persons.", "73). Such legislation appears to have strong support among the psychiatric community. In a survey of a probability sample of U.S. psychiatrists (N=45) by Hoop et al. (\n59), 100% of the sample expressed the belief that genetic test results should be confidential, and 96%\u201398% agreed that results should not be used in insurance or employment decisions. Similarly, in the survey of Laegsgaard and Mors (\n58) of 397 Danish psychiatric patients, 164 relatives, and 100 medical or psychology students, majorities of all three groups endorsed statements that genetic test results should be kept confidential and not shared with employers or insurance companies.\nRelevant to this discussion are the concepts of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d and \u201casymmetric information\u201d\u2014that is, the notion that individuals may be more likely to purchase insurance if they know they have a genetic predisposition to illness (", "82). Growing concerns about group stigmatization based on genetic research have led some minorities to contemplate \u201copting out of genetic research until it's clear we're not going to use science to validate prejudices\u201d (\n83). Indeed, in April 2010 Arizona's Havasupai Native American tribe won a $700,000 settlement with Arizona State University because university researchers had used the tribal members' DNA to study ancestry and mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Although research participants had signed consent forms, many believed the study would be limited to diabetes and found the other research topics stigmatizing or culturally objectionable. As part of the settlement, blood samples were returned to the tribe (\n84).\nThe possibility of population-based stigma and discrimination represents a significant burden on groups being studied, which must be balanced by benefits to the same community from the very same research (", "62) suggest that overall psychological risks may be mild, however, at least for testing that occurs in the context of a research trial. However, specific subsets of individuals appear especially vulnerable to negative psychological consequences of predictive or susceptibility testing for HD or cancer. Pretest symptoms of distress were a better predictor of posttest distress than genetic test results among 160 individuals tested for HD (\n63). Among 65 persons undergoing genetic testing for cancer susceptibility, participants who underestimated the emotional effects of testing were more likely to report feeling distressed afterward (\n64). Differences in ability to tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity may also have an important effect on posttest well-being (\n28).", "115) identified seven features of ethical clinical research: value to society, scientific validity, favorable risk-benefit ratio, fairness in subject selection, informed consent, demonstration of respect for enrolled subjects, and independent review. Roberts (\n116) developed a framework for analyzing the ethical acceptability of psychiatric research protocols, identifying nine key features: scientific merit and design issues; expertise, commitment, and integrity issues; risks and benefits; confidentiality; participant selection and recruitment; informed consent and decisional capacity; and incentives and other issues. A modification of Roberts's framework (\nTable 1) (\n116) that includes ethical considerations particular to genetics provides a useful model for analyzing psychiatric genetic research protocols, particularly gene-finding studies.\nA strategy for categorizing ethical considerations in clinical genotyping was proposed by Burke et al. (\n26) in 2001 (", "Nevertheless, DTC genetic testing may offer some benefits, particularly for stigmatized illnesses, because individuals seeking testing may place a very high premium on privacy. The precedent of HIV testing may be relevant in this context. An over-the-counter kit for HIV testing is currently available, and in-home HIV testing has been proposed as a way to make such testing more anonymous, thereby decreasing its stigma, increasing the empowerment of health care consumers, and increasing the use of HIV tests among young people (", "Protocols designed to gather empirical data regarding the following questions are urgently needed to ground future conceptual ethical work, provide a scientific foundation for ethical and legal guidelines, and ensure that the clinical translation of psychiatric genetic research engenders the public trust:\n\u2022.\nWhat are the actual risks and benefits of clinical psychiatric genotyping? How do those risks and benefits vary, if at all, for different psychiatric disorders, for different testing scenarios (i.e., pharmacogenetic, diagnostic, susceptibility), for different populations (i.e., prenatal testing; newborn screening; testing children, adoptees, decisionally incapable adults), and in different testing circumstances (i.e., private clinic, academic center, direct-to-consumer)?\n\u2022.\nWhat are the actual risks and benefits of clinical psychiatric genetic counseling for various indications and populations?\n\u2022.", "20). As with infectious diseases, the impact of genetic information on third parties can present an ethical dilemma between the need to protect an individual's confidentiality and the third party's \u201cright to know\u201d information that may bear on his or her health. This conflict was the central question in a New Jersey court case brought by a woman with an autosomal dominant form of colon cancer, whose father had died of the same disease. The father's physician had not informed the patient or his family that the illness was heritable and could be prevented with colectomy. The New Jersey Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that a physician had a \u201cduty to warn\u201d those at risk of avoidable harm due to genetic conditions (\n81).", "23) that could foretell the rest of one's life. Such language suggests that there will be tremendous benefits to learning genetic information, and great harm if the privacy of one's genetic \u201cfuture diary\u201d were violated.\nThis deterministic view of genetics formed the backdrop for early conceptual and empirical ethics studies. Investigations of highly penetrant disorders enabled a cataloging of risks and benefits of predictive genetic testing in the research and clinical context (\n25). These risks and benefits can be categorized as medical (i.e., interventions to reduce the impact of the illness or biological side effects of interventions) and psychosocial (i.e., peace of mind, life planning, psychological distress, social stigmatization, and discrimination) (\n13,\n26\u2013", "The ethics of clinical innovation can also provide some guidance regarding the wise use of the first applications of psychiatric genetics. A medical practice falls into the category of \u201cclinical innovation\u201d if its intention is primarily to help individual patients; it is considered \u201cclinical research\u201d if it is conducted systematically to gather generalizable knowledge. Roberts and colleagues (", "38). Will it be ethical, for example, to conduct studies in which antipsychotic medications are administered to adolescents whose genotype suggests that they have a 20% risk of schizophrenia, given that the majority of those treated will incur unnecessary biological and psychosocial risks? What if the likelihood of illness is slightly higher or lower, the disorder more or less stigmatized, or the intervention more or less benign?\nRegarding the clinical use of susceptibility genotyping, it has been argued that low predictive power will prevent such tests from ever being viable (\n39). It appears, however, that commercial interests may propel psychiatric susceptibility testing onto the market in advance of empirical evidence of clinical utility. In 2007, for example, a diagnostic genetic test for bipolar disorder based on variants in the\nGRK3 gene became available from an Internet-based laboratory (", "The flip side of this situation is the family member who does not wish to know his or her genotype, but who will be deprived of the \u201cright not to know\u201d if a relative is tested. This conflict may occur in certain unusual clinical situations, for example, when an adult grandchild of a person with a highly penetrant genetic disorder wishes to have predictive testing, but the grandchild's parent does not. Such ethical dilemmas are not likely to become commonplace, however, in psychiatric practice. The complex inheritance of mental disorders means that susceptibility testing for these illnesses will provide less directly pertinent information about risks to relatives than testing for Mendelian disorders with clear autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked patterns of inheritance.", "8) national telephone survey of Americans' stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. A random sample of 426 U.S. adults was asked to respond to a vignette about a person hospitalized for schizophrenia or depression whose illness was described as completely, partially, or not at all due to genetic factors. Participants were then asked a series of questions about how they would feel and behave toward such a person. Analysis of the responses indicated that the genetic explanation for illness led to a significant reduction in respondents' desire to see the person punished for a violent act committed as a result of the illness. Interestingly, the genetic explanation also increased respondents' desire for social distance from the ill person's sibling. The findings thus indicate that the geneticization of mental illness may decrease some aspects of stigma (punitive attitudes toward ill persons) and increase others (associative stigma toward family members).", "Another set of ethical issues concerns whether and how new applications should be introduced clinically. It will require considerable research funding and many years to gather detailed information about the psychosocial and medical outcomes of genetic counseling and testing for specific psychiatric disorders. Even our understanding of the full implications of testing for a single genetic variant may be incomplete for many years. Because of the phenomenon of genetic pleiotropy (i.e., when a single gene has multiple biological effects), a test for a genetic variant that is associated with one condition today may in the future be found to yield information about susceptibility to another condition (\n97). For example, the\nAPOE genotype is associated not only with the risk of AD but also with the risk of cardiovascular disease (\n98). Another example is the serotonin transporter gene, which is associated with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (", "69). Substantial minorities believed that they or their family members had been denied life insurance (25%), health insurance (22%), or a job (13%) because of a genetic disorder. The findings raised concerns that fears of genetic discrimination may cause many individuals to refuse participation in genetic research protocols or to forgo clinical genetic testing, creating barriers to the clinical translation of research (\n70).\nThere is some evidence that persons with genetic propensities to psychiatric disorders are especially likely to become targets of discriminatory practices. In a survey of 62 workers by Roberts et al. (\n71), respondents felt that personal genetic information showing a moderate risk of disease would be more likely to cause employment discrimination if the disease were mental rather than physical. In a questionnaire survey of 45 individuals with bipolar disorder and their spouses, Trippitelli et al. (", "EFFECTS ON RELATIVES, COMMUNITIES, AND POPULATIONS\nBy its nature, genetic information has implications and consequences for third parties: biological relatives. This phenomenon is not unique to genetics; for example, information about infectious diseases also applies to a patient's contacts (\n19,", "Should research participants be informed of the results of genotyping? If so, under what circumstances, and with what safeguards?\n\u2022.\nHow is fully informed consent best achieved for psychiatric genetic studies involving the storage of DNA for future genotyping?\n\u2022.\nWhat confidentiality protections are necessary to protect research data that may involve individuals' genotypes and also their entire medical records, including psychiatric histories?\n\u2022.\nWhat safeguards are required for psychiatric genetic research involving children and adults without decisional capacity, as well as other vulnerable populations?", "Learning about genetic information related to future health may provoke intense emotions (\n28) ranging from relief, an enhanced sense of well-being, reduced uncertainty, and improved ability to focus on future planning, at one extreme, to anxiety, embarrassment, depression, and hopelessness, at the other. Negative results on a probabilistic test may result in a false sense of security that one is free of all risk of illness, whereas positive results may cause \u201cgenetic hypochondria\u201d (\n27), if individuals become obsessively watchful for the first manifestations of a disease that may never come.\nThe reviews of research assessing the psychological impact of genetic testing by Lerman et al. (\n28) and Wiggins et al. (", "34). In the clinical setting, genetic testing for susceptibility and for drug metabolism and response is just beginning to be applied in psychiatry, but we have few or no data to guide us about their medical and psychosocial outcomes. In the future, it should be possible to make carefully reasoned judgments about the utility and morality of specific types of psychiatric genetic activities, but until then we will also grapple with ethical issues particular to an innovative and evolving technology.\nMethodologies for psychiatric genetic research have changed dramatically in recent years, the result of sequencing the human genome and completing the International HapMap project to characterize human variation across the genome (", "110). The rapid\u2014and virtually unregulated\u2014commercialization of genetic testing is worrisome, evoking memories of the naive treatment of fluoroscopy in the last century, when shoe stores across the United States offered \u201cX-ray shoe fitters\u201d as novelty devices that exposed countless individuals to significant levels of radiation (\n111,\n112). There are few published data specifically regarding the ethical issues of DTC genetic testing in psychiatry, with the exception of the questionnaire survey of a small random sample of U.S. psychiatrists of Hoop et al. (\n59), in which 100% agreed that laws and regulations should require DTC advertising for genetic testing to be truthful and to describe risks as well as benefits, and 96% agreed that there should be restrictions on the DTC sale of psychiatric genetic testing kits.", "More far-reaching ethical issues arise because genetic information may also be used to characterize larger groups of related persons, including communities and populations. There are public health benefits to conducting molecular genetic research on complex inheritance diseases using samples from ethnically and geographically diverse populations, as well as scientific benefits to using samples derived from genetically isolated populations (\n82). Such groups include the Hutterites, Old Order Amish, Ashkenazi Jews, Pima Native Americans, and isolated subpopulations in Colombia, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Iceland, Japan, and Sardinia.\nMolecular research that compares frequencies of genetic variants associated with stigmatized disorders among subpopulations may unintentionally feed racist beliefs if results are misinterpreted to mean that a given group is especially prone to the disease (", "As we have seen, psychiatric genetics provokes a multiplicity of ethical considerations deriving from the complex relationship between genetic information and a person's future mental health, the potential psychosocial impact of genetic information and effects on third parties, and the newness of molecular genetics technology in psychiatry and the uncertainty surrounding its future applications. Although many questions about the impact of these factors remain, the factors themselves can be incorporated into useful frameworks for analyzing the ethics of psychiatric genetic research protocols and clinical activities.\nEthically relevant domains in medical and psychiatric research have been described by several ethicists. Emanuel et al. (", "Despite the limitations of existing studies, their findings are consistent. The clear message is that psychiatric patients and family members are keenly interested in the clinical applications of psychiatric genetics, a message requiring that we work carefully to identify and assess the benefits, as well as the risks, of these new technologies.\nThe REVEAL study (", ". Similarly, because the great burden of psychiatric illness is due to common mental illnesses with complex inheritance, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, attention-deficit disorder, and autism, the emphasis here will be on these diseases rather than the rare, Mendelian illnesses such as Huntington's disease (HD) or Rett's disorder. The related topic of human behavioral genetics, which has been well described elsewhere (", "It is not known whether susceptibility testing for common mental disorders will have special psychological consequences beyond what has been seen with genetic testing for other disorders. Perhaps the most relevant empirical data regarding the psychological effects of susceptibility testing for a common psychiatric disorder have been gathered by an ongoing multisite study called Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer's Disease (REVEAL) (\n65\u2013\n68). In this randomized, controlled trial, individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) received genetic counseling regarding their personal AD risk based either on their age, sex, family history, and apolipoprotein E (\nAPOE) genotype (intervention arm) or on their age, sex, and family history alone (control arm)."], "title": "Ethical Considerations in Psychiatric Genetics | Focus"}, "https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12121558": {"url": "https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12121558", "description": "Objective Recent genetic findings of high-impact genetic variants in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) must lead to profound changes in genetic and family counseling.

She is being treated with appropriate pharmacologic and psychological modalities for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder by a child psychiatrist. With 5 minutes left in the parental portion of a routine follow-up visit, as Kelsey waits in the waiting room, the mother suddenly states to the daughter\u2019s psychiatrist, \u201cOh, I meant to ask you. We sent in our saliva for genetic testing through one of those online services. I found out that Kelsey has the gene for dementia, but I haven\u2019t told her anything about it yet. I was hoping you could talk to her about what it means. I didn\u2019t really understand what was on the report. I was only trying to find out where our ancestors came from.\u201d\nTest Yourself.\nWhich of the following is an appropriate course of action for the psychiatrist to take at this point?\nA.", "In the case presented, it is unclear under what circumstances the mother had the daughter\u2019s genetic testing done. Did Kelsey actually understand what the testing was about, and did she agree to learn her APOE allele status (i.e., did she make an informed, voluntary, and competent decision about the testing)? If the daughter did not make such a choice, it will be important to ensure that the mother understands the gravity of essentially doing genetic testing on her daughter without her daughter\u2019s consent\u2014essentially depriving her child of the right to decide for herself about an important health matter.\nBecause of controversy about the relative benefits versus potential personal, social, and legal consequences of APOE genotyping, numerous organizations have recommended against APOE genotyping and\u2014if testing is conducted\u2014strongly recommend pre- and posttest genetic counseling.\nArguments in favor of disclosure of", "APOE genotype in research and clinical settings, as well as the approval of DTC genetic testing, have been based on the notion of autonomy\u2014that is, the idea that people have a right to their genetic information if they desire it. In addition, results of several studies of disclosure of\nAPOE genotype found that\u2014under highly controlled conditions\u2014adults who learned of positive \u03b54 results did not, overall, suffer significant psychological harm (\n6,\n7), and the most robust predictors of posttest anxiety and depression were baseline anxiety and depression (\n7). The majority of studies that have examined responses to genetic testing for Alzheimer\u2019s disease have included adults with a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (\n8). It should be noted, however, that such findings cannot be generalized to the circumstances surrounding the present case, because there was no pre- or posttest counseling, and it is unclear how well informed the mother was prior to accessing the genetic reports.", "This hypothetical case illustrates some of the issues that psychiatrists may begin to face as genetic testing\u2014perhaps particularly DTC genetic testing\u2014becomes more widespread. What started as the mother\u2019s curiosity about family ancestry appears to have transformed into an unanticipated journey into genetic predictive testing.\nObtaining\nAPOE \u03b54 genetic testing remains controversial. In this case, it appears that the mother has utilized a DTC genetic testing kit, which allows consumers to \u201copt in\u201d to receive certain genetic test results, in particular for alleles that place individuals at increased risk of Parkinson\u2019s or late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The ability of consumers to obtain this information directly (and without a requirement for pre- or posttest genetic counseling) was made possible only relatively recently, by a 2017 decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowing the marketing of \u201cgenetic health risk\u201d tests (\n5).", "Ask the mother whether she obtained Kelsey\u2019s written informed consent for the DTC genetic testing beforehand.\nB.\nExpress interest in seeing the genetic report but caution the mother that genetic counseling may be indicated to ensure that the family fully understands the genetic findings.\nC.\nTell the mother that the findings do not predict dementia accurately enough and that she wasted her money.\nD.\nAsk Kelsey to step back into the office and ask her what she knows about the genetic testing that was done.\nE.\nSchedule a follow-up appointment once a genetic counselor can be identified who can be present to discuss all of Kelsey\u2019s genetic testing.\nThe answer is B. The psychiatrist can express interest to maintain a therapeutic relationship with the family. However, given that the vignette paints a picture of a mother who may not fully understand the genetic report, it would be most helpful to obtain formal genetic counseling.", "One of the most important tasks (and one that will certainly require more than 5 minutes) is for the psychiatrist to ascertain the degree of understanding that the mother possesses regarding the purpose of genetic testing\u2014in particular, the difference between diagnostic and predictive testing. A very useful overview of the range of goals of genetic testing is provided by Hoge and Appelbaum in their comprehensive review of ethical issues in neuropsychiatric genetics (\n2):\nGenetic testing can be used in clinical practice to: establish more definitive diagnoses (\u201cdiagnostic testing\u201d), assist in management decisions (\u201cpharmacogenomic testing\u201d), provide guidance for reproductive choices (\u201creproductive testing\u201d), and estimate the likelihood of disease onset in the future (\u201cpredictive testing\u201d).", "On the basis of the information provided so far, it appears that the mother may have received a genetic report stating that Kelsey has either one or two alleles of the\nAPOE \u03b54 allele, which increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a dose-dependent manner. Genetic prediction based on\nAPOE testing is complex, however, and risk estimates vary depending on sex, ethnicity, and age (\n6). As the frequency of DTC genetic testing increases, cases such as Kelsey\u2019s may become more common. In addition, adults who have had these tests performed may raise questions and concerns with their provider, given the complexity of the information and the potential for lack of understanding.", "Psychiatrists should also be aware that genetic counseling may be obtained through the DTC genetic test companies themselves, usually for an additional fee. In this case, the psychiatrist\u2019s best course of action is to spend additional time gathering more information from the mother about the circumstances of the genetic testing and ascertaining how much the mother already knows about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and genetic risk. The motivations for the mother\u2019s seeking genetic information should also be explored, because there may be relevant family dynamics at play. Although this tricky case is fictional, the issue of whether adolescents should have a choice about receiving their genetic information has been previously discussed and debated. In general, experts believe that predictive testing should not be conducted in children or adolescents when there are no available interventions (\n2).", "Although diagnostic testing is conducted in some instances in psychiatry (e.g., to confirm diagnoses of certain neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders), the case described here presents an instance of predictive testing. One of the purposes of genetic counseling prior to genetic testing is to ensure that there is adequate understanding of the limits of prediction. On the basis of the information presented, the psychiatrist is concerned about whether Kelsey\u2019s mother understands the genetic test results, in particular the probabilistic versus deterministic nature of genetic tests. The common misunderstanding that there is \u201ca gene for\u201d a specific disorder (i.e., genetic determinism) persists, so there will be a need to address this misunderstanding\u2014with success not necessarily assured. Indeed, assessing and enhancing patients\u2019 and families\u2019 understanding of genetic information are likely to become increasingly important roles for psychiatrists and physicians more generally (", "4).\nInformed consent as traditionally conceived\u2014fully informed, voluntary, and competent\u2014may need to be reconsidered as patients increasingly access these tests outside of the physician-patient relationship.

Because the short history of the COVID-19 pandemic has been marred by large amounts of misinformation, it becomes critically important to provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether or not the disease is transmitted by aerosol. This requires the development, standardization, and dissemination of optimal techniques for sampling airborne SARS-CoV-2", "Looking forward and in the context of this journal, the genomics of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the wide variation in clinical response to COVID-19 in patients, should become active areas of investigation. Variations in COVID-19 severity might be classified as (a) asymptomatic, (b) symptomatic but no hospitalization required, and (c) severely symptomatic with hospitalization urgently indicated. Elucidation of alleles of relevant genes associated with these three levels of severity to viral response might aid clinicians in dealing with possible future waves of this pandemic. Elucidation of genomics and genetic pathways related to susceptibility of SARS-Cov-2 infection could also become important in combating a future wave.

Finally, during some viral infections (including HIV), the ADF/cofilin complex (ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor, is encoded by the DSTN gene; cofilin is encoded by CFL1 and CFL2 genes) is activated. In the initial stages of viral infection, hyperactivation of cofilin and inefficient actin polymerization is known to occur .

While suspended airborne droplets can persist in the air for several minutes, the smaller aerosols do not rapidly settle and can persist for longer durations (~ minutes to hours) . Once airborne, the characteristics of aerosols generated by cough or sneeze are dynamic, notably decreasing in size due to evaporative loss of water depending on ambient humidity and temperature levels . As the size of aerosols decrease, their ability to disperse in the air is enhanced.

Below, we therefore review the latest on transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nUnderstanding the impact of airborne coronavirus on transmission", "The premise of aerosol transmission necessitates that the virus remains viable in the air. As viability decreases over time, it is important to understand the rate of inactivation under different environmental conditions, e.g., temperature and humidity . In recent laboratory testing, aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for up to ~ 3 h  when tested at a relative humidity of 65%. Inactivation studies suggested that survival on surfaces, and in the air, may be further enhanced at relative humidities of less than 50% . These results are consistent with other airborne viruses\u2014including SARS-CoV-1 , influenza H1N1 , and MERS-CoV , which also show evidence of airborne transmission. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol collected from real-world air samples, however, has not yet been fully explored.

In this day and age of next-generation sequencing, perhaps groups of 500 or 1000 age- and gender-matched patients could have their entire genomes sequenced, and then sophisticated genetic analysis software programs could home in on single-nucleotide variant (SNV) differences in possibly relevant genes or genomic regions in the afflicted (highly sensitive) and the asymptomatic (highly-resistant) groups.", "An inherent difficulty associated with the airborne route of transmission is that the measures used to reduce airborne exposure can be laborious and are not fail-proof. Common approaches for mitigating airborne exposures include (i) identification of emission sources, (ii) prevention of viral shedding and inhalation exposure, and (iii) environmental controls. The topic of environmental controls leverages evidence of reduced exposures by improving ventilation , utilization of portable filtration devices , or other aerosol inactivation technologies, and cleaning practices to reduce exposure from resuspension . The topic of environmental controls is broad and complex.

Moreover, very little is understood about interindividual genetic differences in the immune response to this new and novel version of the old coronavirus. A possible association between the genetic variability in histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19 has recently been suggested . Specifically, the HLA-B*46:01 gene product is predicted to exhibit the lowest binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, suggesting individuals with this allele may be more vulnerable to COVID-19\u2014due to reduced capacity for viral antigen presentation to immune cells. Conversely, the authors identified that the HLA-B*15:03-encoded protein is predicted to have the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses \u2014suggesting patients possessing this HLA genotype may be more likely to develop immunity", ". No evidence of viral propagation was found for air samples collected at the University of Nebraska Medical Center . This negative result may be attributable to low airborne levels of the virus , but it is also feasible that the air sampling methods used may have contributed to reduced viability of the sampled virus. In Nebraska, air samples were collected at a stationary indoor location on gelatin filters at a flow rate of 50 L/min for 15 min. Air sampling parameters, such as flow rate, influence virus detection and viability . It is critical that air sampling methods for infectious virus do not compromise the integrity of the viral envelope because this would reduce or eliminate infectivity and contribute to false negatives.", ". Face coverings have been recommended by many public health agencies internationally with the aim of preventing new infections. Because the supply of surgical and N95 masks are limited such that available resources are prioritized for health care providers, the general public has been recommended to use homemade cloth face covering to mitigate exposure of healthy individuals and prevent release of aerosolized virus shed from infected individuals . With the increased use of cloth masks, it is important to recognize their limitations and to consider design modifications for improvement. Notably, the filtration efficiency (for inward or outward protection) of a cloth face covering varies by the type of material used . Use of a single-ply thin fabric (such as cotton, silk, or linen) has a relatively low capacity for capturing submicron (< 1 \u03bcm) virus-laden aerosol", ".uk/2020/04/covid/).", "Some indoor public spaces tested in Wuhan, China, were found to have detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2, including the hospital pharmacy and department stores . Airborne levels of the virus in these public spaces were comparable to concentrations detected in hospital patient workspace areas but lower than measurements in medical staff areas.\nDisease transmission by SARS-CoV-2 aerosols\nDetection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor air of hospitals and public spaces raises several questions: What is the ability for this airborne form of the virus to transmit disease (i.e., is the virus viable)? And how do measured viral concentrations in the air (which, to date, have been only accomplished through PCR-based approaches) relate to an infectious dose?", ". Such techniques are essential for the adoption of proven strategies that limit exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and will likely decrease new cases and protect the population, when the pandemic wanes and return-to-work strategies are being implemented.", "A range of face coverings is available\u2014including N95 respirator masks, surgical masks, and cloth coverings, each offering different efficiencies for inward protection (i.e., PPE) and outward protection (i.e., source control) from virus-laden aerosol and/or droplets. For inward protection of the individuals wearing the masks, the gold-standard N95 masks are capable of filtering > 99% of airborne aerosols; this is in contrast to filtration efficiencies of surgical masks (~ 75%) and cloth coverings (~ 67%) that afford inward protection against for aerosols sized between 0.02 and 1 \u03bcm . For outward protection of other individuals from the individual wearing the mask, the N95 has been shown to prevent ~ 70% of aerosols (0.2 to 1 \u03bcm) generated by coughing and then from being released. On the other hand, surgical masks and cloth masks leaked ~ 50% and ~ 90%, respectively, of the same emissions ", "What makes some people more vulnerable than others to SARS-CoV-2? What role do gene networks play in determining or influencing efficiency of infection, the immune response to infection, or the severity of COVID-19 symptoms? For example, genetic polymorphisms exist in the ACE2 gene , which encodes the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2; allelic variants of the ACE2 may influence the protein\u2019s binding with the virus  and subsequent invasion of the cell. In addition, polymorphisms of cellular proteases\u2014believed to facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, along with furin  and TMPRSS2 \u2014have been shown to exist . Indeed, a recent preprint suggests that TMPRSS2 variants and resulting expression may influence COVID-19 severity .

With the number of COVID-19 cases now exceeding 2 million worldwide, it is apparent that (i) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very high and (ii) there are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in the response to the virus. Controlling current rates of infection and combating future waves require a better understanding of the routes of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the underlying genomic susceptibility to this disease. In this mini-review, we highlight possible genetic determinants of COVID-19 and the contribution of aerosol exposure as a potentially important transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.\nGenomics of susceptibility and resistance", "Beyond coughing and sneezing, normal speech and breathing can also generate aerosol. The size of aerosol generated by speaking and breathing is similar, ranging from 0.75 to 1.1 \u03bcm, but is notably smaller than those generated by coughing or sneezing, i.e., ~ 5 \u03bcm . Prior studies that collected exhaled breath condensate from influenza patients have demonstrated that this respiratory virus could be emitted just by breathing . The small size of aerosols released through this route potentially extends their range of travel. The concentration of aerosol released by the combination of speaking and breathing for more than 4 min is equivalent to the amount of aerosol emitted for 30 s of singing or coughing ", ".0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.", ". The volume of speech can further influence aerosol release, leading to variations in emission rates between individuals that may impact their capacity for viral transmission ; this is relevant, in particular, for infected individuals that are pre-symptomatic or have asymptomatic illness. Transmission of aerosol generated through these routes over short distances has been supported by recent case studies of family clusters in various Chinese cities , a restaurant setting in Guangzhou, China,  and a choir group in Mount Vernon, WA, USA . In addition, droplets or aerosols deposited on floors and surfaces can become resuspended by human activity, and resuspended particles can comprise the majority of the aerosols within an occupied setting .", "Viral shedding by an individual has been suggested to be greatest immediately following infection, prior to onset of symptoms . Unfortunately, current testing protocols require most individuals to have developed multiple symptoms of COVID-19 in order to qualify for testing, after which a confirmed diagnosis can be made. Monitoring airborne levels of SARS-CoV-2 may be an alternative method for identifying exposure hotspots and could be used to alert individuals, at increased risk of infection, to practice self-isolation measures. Such exposure testing might be conducted at fixed indoor locations of particular concern, such as sites with vulnerable individuals (e.g., nursing homes) or high activity (e.g., groceries stores). Wearable air sampling equipment is also available and can be used to assess personal SARS-CoV-2 exposure", "How individuals respond to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is becoming better understood in a global sense, but differences in the vulnerability of individuals to infection and in the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms remain to be understood. It is known that advanced age and pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal diseases) render a person more vulnerable to the more severe health consequences of COVID-19 . However, a surprising observation emanating from the pandemic is the rate of hospitalization of younger, ostensibly healthy individuals.", "In Iceland, the company deCODE Genetics has monitored the spread of the virus using SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis  and has partnered with Iceland\u2019s government to sequence the genomes of viral hosts, i.e., patients who were previously infected with COVID-19 (https://www.decode.com/).

Psychiatric genomics has progressed rapidly in the last decade, shedding light on the biological makeup of cross-disorder risk at multiple levels of analysis. Over a hundred genetic variants have been identified that affect multiple disorders, with many more to be uncovered as sample sizes continue to grow. Cross-disorder mechanistic studies build on these findings to cluster transdiagnostic variants into meaningful categories, including in what tissues or when in development these variants are expressed. At the upper-most level, methods have been developed to estimate the overall shared genetic signal across pairs of traits (i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations) and subsequently model these relationships to identify overarching, genomic risk factors", ". These factors can subsequently be associated with external traits (e.g. functional imaging phenotypes) to begin to understand the makeup of these transdiagnostic risk factors. As psychiatric genomic efforts continue to expand, we can begin to gain even greater insight by including more fine-grained phenotypes (i.e. symptom-level data) and explicitly considering the environment.

According to Burke\u2019s frameworks, the primary ethical consideration in psychiatric genetic testing is nonmaleficence, doing no harm, as few effective treatments can be provided based on test results and tests have low predictive power. Hoop proposes an expanded framework that includes additional factors, such as psychosocial risk, the level of stigma of the condition, and the newness of the test to provide a more robust evaluation of whether genetic tests for psychiatric disorders are ethical.\nLastly, Hoop emphasizes the importance of designing \u201cprospective evaluations of the outcomes of psychiatric genetic counseling and testing\u2026[to] complement empirical ethics research methods\u201d. She argues that the knowledge gained from such studies will help prevent genetic discrimination and improve public trust in psychiatric genetic research and testing.", "At the time of Hoop\u2019s writing, many candidate genes had been identified, but virtually no genes had been conclusively linked to psychiatric disease, with the exception of APOE for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Without a definitive link between gene and disease, genetic testing may be highly unethical. With significant advancements in the field, however, direct-to-consumer or physician-requested genetic testing will certainly play a future role in the management of psychiatric illness. It will fall to the clinician to interpret the results and advise patients on how to proceed. Unfortunately, data from the most recent studies published (up to 2008)  indicate that the vast majority of psychiatrists are insufficiently trained in genetics to provide this service and that there are too few genetic counselors to fill in the gaps.", "Many more genes involved in psychiatric disease are likely to emerge in the near future, with the thousand-dollar genome, once a distant dream, now at our fingertips . Furthermore, some genetically informed pharmacotherapies are now in development, from mGluR5 antagonists for fragile-X syndrome to PI3K inhibitors for schizophrenia  With such advances, nonmaleficence will no longer be the prevailing ethical principle dictating psychiatric genetic testing. Instead, as Hoop proposes, justice, respect for autonomy, psychosocial risk and stigma of disease will all have to be strongly considered before pursuing genetic testing for psychiatric illness.\nReferences\n- Schulze TG, Fangerau H, Propping P.

This is a particularly timely contribution to the field, as our knowledge about the genetic underpinnings of mental illness has been advancing at a furious pace. For example, many genomic deletions and duplications have been detected in patients with autism spectrum disorders . This has led to recent guideline changes recommending chromosomal microarray analysis as part of an initial work-up for children who display autistic-type behaviors . Similar advances have been made in schizophrenia, with strong evidence for associations with vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VIPR2), neurexin 1 (NRXN1),and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) .", "Hoop identifies psychological consequences, insurance and employment discrimination, and social stigmatization as the three main psychosocial risks of psychiatric genetic testing. While genetic testing in general certainly has psychological consequences, the consequences of genetic testing for psychiatric disorders may be more profound. Many view the psyche as an inextricable component of one\u2019s being. Thus, being told of a genetic \u201cdefect\u201d in one\u2019s psyche may be particularly distressing. The findings of several studies Hoop cites are consistent with this theory; they suggest that \u201clearning one has a \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 [psychiatric] genotype may have a more profound psychological impact than learning one\u2019s absolute risk of illness\u201d.", "In contrast, hundreds or thousands of genes each confer a small increase in risk for developing schizophrenia. Testing a patient for such genes provides only an estimate of his or her increased risk for developing schizophrenia (e.g. 3 percent, when risk is 1 percent in the general population) with much uncertainty remaining. Hoop highlights the difficulty patients are likely to have in interpreting such results. Some patients may think they are completely free of risk if they test negative for a risk gene, while others may believe that they are destined to develop a disease if they test positive, when really they may have only a slightly greater-than-average risk.", "Genetic information can also have serious implications for relatives of a person being tested and for those who come from a similar ethnic background. For example, if a grandparent developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his or her grandchild (of adult age) may wish to get tested for disease-related genes to determine the risk for developing Alzheimer\u2019s. If the grandchild\u2019s parent does not want to know his or her risk, an ethical dilemma arises in which the parent\u2019s right to not to know must be weighed against the child\u2019s right to know.", "She begins by describing how the landscape of clinical psychiatric genetics has changed from one focused on rare, monogenic disorders such as Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) to one that will be dedicated increasingly to common, polygenic diseases, such as schizophrenia. In HD, the ethical debate concerns the risks and benefits of providing a patient with precise information about his or her medical future\u2014if you have the HD gene, you will get the disease if you live until its onset, typically middle age. If little can be done to prevent the onset or mitigate the effects of the disease being tested for, is it ethical to test for the disease at all?", "Before the Nazi regime focused its efforts on the extermination of European Jewry, one of its early eugenics directives aimed at cleansing the gene pool of psychiatric disease. Thousands of mentally ill patients were either sterilized against their will or murdered as part of the German Racial Hygiene Movement. Shamefully, this movement was largely fueled by the research and ideologies of early psychiatric geneticists, such as Ernst Rudin .\nSimilar efforts were undertaken in the United States to prevent the reproduction of those deemed mentally insufficient. This practice was famously upheld by the Supreme Court in Buck v. Bell in 1927, with Justice Oliver Holmes Jr. concluding his argument by declaring that \u201cThree generations of imbeciles are enough\u201d in reference to the plaintiff Carrie Buck, her mother, and her daughter .", "Another potential hazard of genetic testing in psychiatry is that employers, insurers, and the general public may discriminate against individuals based on their psychiatric genotypes. Hoop discusses a case of three young men who lost their jobs because their employer discovered that they had first-degree relatives with schizophrenia . There is a risk that similar discrimination could occur based on one\u2019s genotype, a risk that may be more likely to happen with mental than with physical disease. In hopes of limiting such discrimination, the United States Congress enacted the Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 .", "Similarly, ethical conflicts may arise during population-based genetic testing in reproductively isolated groups, such as the Amish or Ashkenazi Jews. Testing can have great public health benefits by identifying severe genetic conditions that are present in these groups. But this benefit must be carefully weighed against the risk that finding a genetic predisposition for illness, especially mental illness, could reinforce preexisting stigmas and provide a false basis for discrimination and bigotry.", "Given a past marred by such ethically deplorable behavior, it is vital for current medical professionals to have a thorough understanding of the ethical issues involved in psychiatric genetics and a structured framework with which to evaluate new psychiatric genetic tests.

Patient-centered safeguards, such as confidentiality protections, careful attention to the informed consent process, and genetic counseling, were put in place to protect individuals against potential harms and to enhance autonomous decision making (\n13). Thorny ethical issues arising in specific testing contexts were identified and described, such as the person with a known predisposition to HD who refuses to disclose this information to family members (\n29,\n30), parents who seek to have minor children tested for adult-onset conditions with no preventive treatment (\n31\u2013\n33), or pregnant couples wishing to obtain prenatal testing and abortion for a mild genetic disability that does not preclude a satisfactory quality of life (\n16,\n17).\nHighly penetrant disorders are rare in the overall population, however, and they are not necessarily good models for understanding either the genetics or the \u201cgenethics\u201d of the vast burden of human illnesses (", "99). Pharmacogenetic testing for variants of this gene is now clinically available as an aid in selecting an antidepressant treatment (\n100). The serotonin transporter gene has also been associated, however, with a large number of psychiatric syndromes. In the future, information that had been sought solely for pharmacogenetic purposes may yield unwanted and unanticipated information about the risk of other conditions (\n97).\nA third ethical issue that derives from the newness of the psychiatric genome era is that it is unclear who should bear ethical and legal responsibility for its clinical applications. On one hand, most psychiatrists are not trained in genetic counseling and testing (\n101\u2013\n103) and do not seem prepared to provide these services (\n54,\n101,\n102). On the other hand, the current number of certified genetic counselors and fellowship-trained clinical geneticists is likely to be too small to meet the projected need for future counseling and testing (", "As we have seen, most of the published data that are directly pertinent to psychiatric genetics ethics concern clinical, rather than research, ethics, and most of these studies consist of questionnaire surveys of patients, families, and clinicians regarding interest in genetic testing. Most surveys polled small convenience samples, which limits the generalizability of their results. Some early studies assessed opinions about scenarios that now appear moot, such as 100% predictive genetic testing for a common psychiatric disorder or in utero gene therapy to prevent such an illness. Meanwhile, attitudes toward the most feasible form of psychiatric genetic testing\u2014pharmacogenetic\u2014have only rarely been assessed. Investigators in this field have obviously been chasing a moving target over the past two decades.", "113). An important difference between HIV testing and susceptibility testing for psychiatric illness, however, is that HIV-testing kits have high positive and negative predictive power, indicating less need to be concerned about the misinterpretation of test results. Another difference is the public health importance of knowing one's HIV status, enabling people to benefit from available treatment and to take steps to avoid infecting others; there are no similar benefits to psychiatric genetic testing at this time.\nFinally, new and innovative technologies tend to be costly, which raises the ethical issue of distributive justice and the equitable distribution of social benefits and burdens. If clinical genotyping proves efficacious, it is unclear what the impact will be on existing health care disparities in the United States (\n114).\nDISCUSSION\nAnalyzing ethical considerations in psychiatric genetic research and testing", "These data suggest that learning one has a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d genotype may have a more profound psychological impact than learning one's absolute risk of illness. Consistent with this notion was a finding that participants in the intervention arm were better able to recall their genotype than their absolute risk assessment at 1 year after the intervention (\n65).\nGenetic discrimination\nFor more than a decade, concerns have been mounting about the potential misuse of genetic data to discriminate against individuals in insurance and employment. A survey published in\nScience in 1996 described the incidence of discrimination among 332 individuals who belonged to genetics support groups (", "One of the most well-designed and generalizable studies on this topic was Phelan's (", "Table 2). Using current clinical practice as a descriptive guide, these authors categorized ethical considerations on the basis of the predictive power of a genetic test and the availability and acceptability of medical treatments for the condition (\n26). According to this framework, we would expect that the first susceptibility tests for most common mental illnesses would be categorized as low in predictive power and as lacking acceptable medical interventions, because of a dearth of evidence regarding the utility of preventive interventions. For such tests, according to the framework of Burke et al, the dominant ethical consideration would be nonmaleficence\u2014that is, to do no harm by withholding the test until it could be established that an individual would have a favorable risk/benefit ratio.\nOther experts (", "50) found that they most often mentioned insurance discrimination as a risk associated with genetic testing for that illness. Finally, a disturbing case series published in 2001 documented employment discrimination against three young men in Hong Kong who had applied for civil service jobs and were rejected or fired on the basis of a first-degree family history of schizophrenia (\n72). However, a 2004 review of the work of 50 researchers studying genetic influences on substance abuse and on psychiatric disorders found no adverse effects such as misuse of data or loss of confidentiality (unpublished data of J. F. Cubells et al. 2004).\nAs a response to the perceived injustice of discrimination based on genotype, most states have enacted some form of antidiscrimination legislation, and a federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, was enacted in 2008 (", "20) have suggested that such a system should incorporate not only the medical benefits, but also the possibility of psychosocial risks\u2014which seems particularly apt in the case of psychiatric genetics. A more detailed framework would encompass all these elements plus factor in the newness of the test, the testing circumstance (i.e., academic setting, private clinic, DTC), and the test's purpose (i.e., susceptibility, diagnostic, pharmacogenetic, prenatal, newborn screening). Thus, tests would be categorized according to their predictive power, purposes, availability of acceptable interventions, level of stigma of the condition, likely psychological impact of the condition, possibility of negative effects on third parties, availability of safeguards, and newness of the test (", "104). Furthermore, the genetics professionals may not feel adequately trained to work with psychiatric patients (\n105). Increased education and training in psychiatric genetics appears necessary for both groups. A multidisciplinary approach to clinical care, involving both psychiatrists and genetic counselors, has also been suggested (\n103).\nIt is possible that the emerging phenomenon of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing via Internet laboratories may move psychiatric testing out of the clinic entirely (\n106\u2013\n108). DTC genetic testing is now available for a variety of purposes\u2014paternity testing, ancestry tracing, pharmacogenetic testing, and even whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping to \u201chelp you read and understand your DNA.\u201d (\n109)\nDTC genetic testing is legal in many states, and there is little federal oversight, although professional groups such as the American Society for Human Genetics have raised many concerns (", "In theory, psychosocial effects may be especially strong in the case of psychiatric disorders. Mental illnesses affect emotions, cognitions, and behavior; as such, they may seem more inextricably bound to one's personhood than disorders that are exclusively somatic. Given the pervasive stigma of mental illness, people who are thought to be susceptible to these disorders may be more vulnerable to discrimination and stigmatization. Furthermore, because many psychiatric disorders begin in young adulthood, genetic information about disease susceptibility may be obtained relatively early in life, with unknown results on an individual's developing sense of self and future prospects. The sections below will consider empirical evidence regarding the likely quality and magnitude of three types of psychosocial effects in psychiatric genetics\u2014psychological consequences, insurance and employment discrimination, and social stigmatization.\nPsychological consequences", "74). In theory, denying the same information to insurance providers would place insurers at a financial disadvantage because they could not adjust premiums to account for different levels of genetic risk. Furthermore, without the ability to make such adjustments, insurers could not charge lower premiums for individuals who have beneficial genotypes. Ironically, this inability to adjust premiums could unfairly burden people who have a strong family history of illness but for whom genetic testing indicates reduced personal risk (\n75).", "Table 3). This cluster of factors is dependent upon the test, the point in time, the disorder, the testing circumstances, and the characteristics of the individual being tested, the last of which may affect the predictive power of the test, the likelihood that third parties will be affected, and the vulnerability to psychosocial harms.", "21,\n22), will not be addressed. Finally, because in 2010, the ethics of psychiatric genetics provokes far more questions than answers, this article will conclude by identifying several topics for future research.\nGENETICS AS A PREDICTOR OF FUTURE HEALTH\nSince the 1980s, molecular genetics researchers have found more than 1,000 mutations associated with highly penetrant genetic disorders such as HD, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy (\n7). These triumphs of gene finding have been followed by the availability of clinical genetic testing to detect carrier status and to predict whether at-risk individuals actually develop disease. During the early days of gene-finding research, media reporters, experts, and public figures tended to describe DNA in awe-inspiring, even mystical terms, for example, as the \u201ccode of life,\u201d the \u201cbook of life,\u201d \u201ccentral to our core\u201d (\n20), \u201cuniquely powerful and uniquely personal\u201d (\n23), \u201cthe language in which God created man\u201d (\n24), and a \u201cfuture diary\u201d (", "According to this method of analysis, a newly developed DTC susceptibility genetic test that is poorly predictive and for a condition that lacks intervention and is highly stigmatized should raise many more red flags than an established, highly predictive diagnostic test offered by well-trained clinicians for a condition that is less stigmatized and for which preventive treatment is available. Some might say that the former test should be withheld entirely on the principle of nonmaleficence, whereas others might believe it overly paternalistic to do so if informed consent procedures could be established to ensure that individuals being tested fully understood and accepted the implications.", "How can informed consent be best achieved, given the probabilistic nature of test results and the possibility of secondary information arising in the future?\n\u2022.\nWhat safeguards, such as confidentiality protections and pre- and posttest counseling, are necessary to protect individuals from psychosocial harms?\n\u2022.\nWhat is the appropriate role of psychiatrists and other clinicians in providing genetic counseling and testing?\nAs we have seen, the empirical evidence base on ethically relevant considerations in psychiatric genetics is almost exclusively focused on clinical, rather than research, ethics. The following questions (among others) need to be addressed regarding the ethics of psychiatric genetic research:\n\u2022.\nHow can research benefits be maximized and risks minimized for individuals, populations, and communities that participate in genetic studies of psychiatric disorders, given the social stigma of these conditions?\n\u2022.", "35), although genotyping alone will never provide results with 100% power because of the contributions of environment and epigenetic factors.\nThe lack of certainty associated with susceptibility genotyping is likely to engender a number of ethical dilemmas. For example, in the future it may be possible to use genotyping in the research context to help identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing mental disorders. Such individuals may then be enrolled into protocols designed to test interventions to prevent or ameliorate disease. The potential benefits of this line of research are tremendous, but they must be balanced against the risks of genetic labeling. For example, a child who is considered to be at elevated risk for schizophrenia may be viewed negatively by others, and the effects of this knowledge on the developing sense of self may be devastating. More well-known risks include the harms associated with any interventions provided to high-risk individuals (\n36\u2013", "40). Results of this test were to provide risk estimates for bipolar disorder of 2% or 3% (versus 1% at baseline). Other psychiatric genetic tests have been proposed as well (\n41).\nThe ethical implications of the commercialization of psychiatric genotyping will be discussed later in this article. For now, we will consider difficulties particular to working with probabilistic tests, such as the hurdles that must be overcome to ensure informed consent and to avoid misinterpretation of tests. A growing literature suggests that patients' interpretation of risk estimates is extraordinarily complex (\n42\u2013", "59) Early survey instruments tended to present psychiatric genetics in highly deterministic terms, but later work has emphasized the probabilistic nature of genetic testing. If we consider only the studies that specifically mentioned that psychiatric susceptibility testing might not be 100% predictive, the data still demonstrate that patients and families see a substantial benefit to genetic testing for the purposes of life planning and early diagnosis (\n49,\n50,\n53,\n55,\n56,\n58). Patients and families appear to be more focused on the perceived benefits of testing and less focused on the risks than clinicians or researchers (\n56). This disparity may be the result of the layperson's lack of awareness of the risks of genetic testing. It may also be that individuals who have intimate experience in living with mental illness are more attuned to the benefits of information that could guide treatment or future plans.", "14). To some bioethicists, the emerging importance of this issue has suggested a need to reconceptualize the dominant ethical considerations in genetic research from autonomy-based ethics to a more communitarian ethics that focuses on the risks and benefits of research for communities and populations rather than for individual participants (\n14).\nGENETICS AND THE ETHICS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\nPsychiatric genetics, as a body of scientific knowledge and a set of clinical activities, is far from being fully mature. There is scientific consensus that the common mental disorders are heritable and that a number of genetic variants are likely to be involved in most illnesses (\n7), but there is no firm consensus about which specific genes are associated with which mental illnesses, with the exception of\nAPOE and AD (", "46) influenced by cognitive, affective, and cultural factors. We know very little about how individuals will understand and act upon the results of tests that provide subtle information about the risk of highly stigmatized disorders. Furthermore, moral questions arise about what level of absolute risk increase is sufficient for specific applications, such as prenatal testing or clinical susceptibility testing to aid life planning.\nExisting empirical evidence sheds some light on one aspect of this issue: how the probabilistic nature of genetic information may affect consumer interest in genetic testing. A number of investigators have surveyed patients and families about their attitudes toward genetic testing for psychiatric illnesses and have generally found keen interest in clinical genotyping (\n47\u2013", "After a review of empirical literature that speaks to these four characteristics of psychiatric genetics, this review will present two conceptual frameworks that can be used to systematically analyze the ethics of psychiatric genetic research and clinical genotyping. Throughout this article, the emphasis will be on ethical considerations arising from today's technology, rather than the morality of less immediate applications such as new diagnostic classification systems or highly speculative applications such as germ-line manipulation through genetic engineering. Because most of the literature in this field has centered on clinical genetic testing and because such tests are now becoming available, genetic testing will be a major focus of the article", "60). It is also consistent with studies of interest in testing for genetic susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (\n61).\nPSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF GENETIC INFORMATION\nThe ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence suggest that careful attention must be paid to the psychosocial effects of psychiatric genetics to maximize the personal and social benefits and to minimize the risks. Understanding these risks and benefits is also necessary to fulfill the ethical duty of respect for persons, which requires researchers and clinicians to provide information about the likely results of medical interventions to obtain fully informed consent. Finally, justice requires consideration of the potential social harms that may befall individuals and groups as a result of their participation in clinical and research activities.", "A preliminary analysis of data for 162 participants found no differences in depression or anxiety among the participants at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postintervention, and no individuals met the criteria for clinical depression or anxiety diagnoses (\n65). As a more targeted measure of the psychological sequelae of genotyping, researchers compared survey responses of a subset of 30 women in the genotype group and 36 women in the control group, all of whom were determined to have a 29% lifetime risk of AD. Even though all the women had the same absolute risk of disease, those in the genotype group (none of whom had an\nAPOE e4 risk allele) perceived their risk of AD as lower, had decreased anxiety about developing AD, and had a more positive attitude toward the risk assessment (\n67).", "85) along with technological advances that enable rapid and relatively inexpensive genotyping. Genetic protocols are becoming grander in scale (e.g., studies of genetic variation among populations of entire countries), in longitudinal sweep (protocols in which DNA is banked for future study), and in the complexity of information that they gather (genotypic data that are linked with phenotypic data, including complex and continually updated medical records). The rapid development of the \u201cgenome era\u201d of medical research has ushered in new ethical concerns (\n14,\n86\u2013\n88). Today's investigators and research participants are unlikely to anticipate all future research uses of genetic material in stored samples, for example, and there is as yet no firm consensus about whether and how informed consent should be obtained for future projects (\n89\u2013", "65) of susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease demonstrates that ethically important considerations can be assessed using the gold standard of protocol designs, the randomized controlled trial. The REVEAL study also suggests that the psychological risks of susceptibility testing may be lower, and the benefits higher, than previously expected, at least for highly educated individuals who have a family history of illness and in the context of a comprehensive program that includes pre- and posttest genetic counseling and careful attention to informed consent. As new clinical applications of psychiatric genetics become feasible, it should be possible to design prospective evaluations of the outcomes of psychiatric genetic counseling and testing, following the model of the REVEAL study. Such investigations could complement traditional \u201cempirical ethics research\u201d methods, such as focus groups, key informant interviews, and questionnaire surveys of stakeholders.", "Psychiatric genetic research is a source of great hope for many individuals with mental illness, their families, and the clinicians who care for them. In 2010, the research enterprise appears poised to begin to fulfill some of those hopes. Molecular genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia have been validated in independent samples (\n1\u2013\n5), and researchers working to find genes associated with other common complex inheritance diseases such as diabetes (\n6) have had clear successes. Many observers believe that psychiatric genetic research is on the same promising path (\n7,\n8).\nPsychiatric genetics is a complex and rapidly changing endeavor, however, and it requires a detailed and dynamic ethics (", "26) including the major psychiatric diseases, which have complex inheritance. Complex inheritance disorders, sometimes called multifactorial illnesses, are caused by a combination of at least two and perhaps hundreds of genes and nongenetic factors such as environmental and epigenetic influences (i.e., patterns of DNA methylation and histone modification) (\n34). It now appears that multiple genes are involved in the etiology of most mental disorders, each gene contributing a small amount of increased risk (\n7).\nUnlike genetic tests for highly penetrant disorders, tests for individual genetic variants associated with most cases of psychiatric disorders have been expected to have low predictive power (an absolute increase or decrease in risk on the order of a few percentage points), and the risk variants have been expected to be common in the population (\n7). Eventually, it may be possible to test for a combination of susceptibility variants to achieve much greater predictive power (", "Empirical data on this issue are limited, though the REVEAL study (described in the previous section) assessed insurance-purchasing behaviors after participants were informed of their risk of illness. Participants who learned they had one or two copies of the risk allele for Alzheimer's disease were 5.76 times more likely then those who were not told their risk status to report having changed long-term care insurance coverage at 1 year after the intervention. There were no other differences, however, in behaviors regarding life insurance or other forms of health insurance (\n76).\nStigma and the \u201cgeneticization\u201d of mental illness", "Another possibility is that consumers' interest in genetic information is related to an exaggerated sense of the risk of recurrence of mental disorders. Evidence of such an association was provided by Austin et al. (\n57) in a web-based survey of 116 family members of individuals with mental illnesses who were identified through a consumer web site regarding psychosis. Most respondents incorrectly estimated the risk for psychosis in the sibling of an affected person, with 45% overestimating the risk and 8% underestimating the risk. The investigators found that the overestimation of risk was associated with more positive views toward predictive genetic testing in general and specifically during pregnancy. This finding is consistent with the existing literature on prenatal testing for other disorders, whose uptake appears more dependent upon individuals' perception of risk than actual risk (", "15). That is, the diagnosis will appear more credible if it is based on a biological test rather than a clinical interview and more permanent if the illness arises from one's DNA. Patients may also be saddled with an additional label of \u201cgenetic deviance\u201d in addition to being categorized as mentally ill (\n78).\nAttempts to investigate these issues empirically have produced conflicting results (\n15,\n77). A vignette survey of 126 New Zealand undergraduates demonstrated that students who were given a biological and genetic explanation for schizophrenia described a person with schizophrenia as more dangerous and unpredictable than did students who were given a psychosocial explanation for the illness (\n79). An exploratory study of patients with bipolar disorder and their family members in Australia found that most believed that the genetic etiology of bipolar disorder would decrease stigma by absolving individuals of responsibility for the illness (\n55).", "14). On the most general level, psychiatric genetics describes our profession's current understanding of mental disorders as heritable and biologically mediated rather than solely the result of psychosocial influences. The field also incorporates a long history of quantitative and qualitative psychiatric genetic research, including family, twin, and adoption studies, as well as linkage analyses and association scans. Finally, psychiatric genetics describes an emerging group of clinical applications such as pharmacogenetic, diagnostic, and susceptibility genotyping. Each of these aspects of psychiatric genetics provokes numerous ethical questions\u2014ranging from how the \u201cgeneticization\u201d of mental illness will affect its stigma (\n15) to whether psychiatric genetic research should be conducted among marginalized communities to the morality of prenatal testing for susceptibility to mild and treatable mental disorders (\n16,\n17).", "In application of this model to psychiatric genetic testing, it is possible that some innovative uses of pharmacogenetic and diagnostic testing could meet all five criteria relatively quickly if appropriate safeguards are established. Of prime importance are confidentiality protections and informed consent processes that address, among other considerations, the possibility of secondary information arising in the future due to genetic pleiotropy. The innovative use of clinical susceptibility testing may be more difficult to justify ethically: in the absence of substantial new knowledge about outcomes, it may be difficult to prove either that there are unique benefits (beyond genetic risk assessment based on family history) or that the possible risks of susceptibility testing do not exceed the risks of forgoing testing.\nDirections for future research", "Many patients, families, and clinicians have expressed hope that the geneticization of mental illness will decrease its social stigma by demonstrating that these disorders are biologically mediated and that individuals should not be blamed for their illnesses. These ideas are demonstrated in public health campaigns suggesting that psychiatric disorders are \u201cillness[es] like any other[s]\u201d and in advocacy groups' definitions of mental disorders as \u201cbrain diseases\u201d (\n77). Some investigators, however, have suggested that despite potentially salutary effects on blaming, the geneticization of psychiatric disorders will worsen stigma by making the diagnostic label of mental illness \u201cstickier\u201d (", "95). There is also a lack of agreement concerning measures to protect confidentiality of study data while allowing multiple investigators access to genotypic information linked to medical records or other phenotypic data (\n86\u2013\n89). Institutional review boards may therefore lack consistent methods for evaluating informed consent forms, confidentiality protections, and other protocol elements (\n96).", "This review aims to introduce the reader to the complexity and fluidity of ethical issues in psychiatric genetics. Rather than attempting a fully comprehensive study, which has been the subject of book-length monographs (\n13,\n18), this article will focus primarily on four broad characteristics of psychiatric genetics that merit ethical attention. First, genetic information may, to a greater or lesser extent, predict a person's future health. Second, learning about one's genotype may have profound psychosocial consequences. Third, genetic information pertains to a person's biological relatives and thus can affect family members, communities, and population groups. Finally, psychiatric genetics is a rapidly evolving field. None of these characteristics is necessarily \u201cexceptional\u201d or unique to genetics (\n19,\n20), but they will provide a useful structure for teasing apart a complex set of ethical issues.", "117) have proposed that clinical innovation in psychiatry is ethically justifiable if the following conditions are met: 1) scientific evidence suggests that the innovation is uniquely beneficial; 2) there is a clinical need for the innovative treatment; 3) the possible risks of the intervention do not exceed the risks of the individual's current condition; 4) all standard efforts have been tried and failed; and 5) appropriate safeguards (such as informed consent, monitoring for adverse effects, and reevaluating the scientific evidence) are implemented. If all five conditions are met, the practice may be justified on the basis of the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and respect for persons.", "73). Such legislation appears to have strong support among the psychiatric community. In a survey of a probability sample of U.S. psychiatrists (N=45) by Hoop et al. (\n59), 100% of the sample expressed the belief that genetic test results should be confidential, and 96%\u201398% agreed that results should not be used in insurance or employment decisions. Similarly, in the survey of Laegsgaard and Mors (\n58) of 397 Danish psychiatric patients, 164 relatives, and 100 medical or psychology students, majorities of all three groups endorsed statements that genetic test results should be kept confidential and not shared with employers or insurance companies.\nRelevant to this discussion are the concepts of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d and \u201casymmetric information\u201d\u2014that is, the notion that individuals may be more likely to purchase insurance if they know they have a genetic predisposition to illness (", "82). Growing concerns about group stigmatization based on genetic research have led some minorities to contemplate \u201copting out of genetic research until it's clear we're not going to use science to validate prejudices\u201d (\n83). Indeed, in April 2010 Arizona's Havasupai Native American tribe won a $700,000 settlement with Arizona State University because university researchers had used the tribal members' DNA to study ancestry and mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Although research participants had signed consent forms, many believed the study would be limited to diabetes and found the other research topics stigmatizing or culturally objectionable. As part of the settlement, blood samples were returned to the tribe (\n84).\nThe possibility of population-based stigma and discrimination represents a significant burden on groups being studied, which must be balanced by benefits to the same community from the very same research (", "62) suggest that overall psychological risks may be mild, however, at least for testing that occurs in the context of a research trial. However, specific subsets of individuals appear especially vulnerable to negative psychological consequences of predictive or susceptibility testing for HD or cancer. Pretest symptoms of distress were a better predictor of posttest distress than genetic test results among 160 individuals tested for HD (\n63). Among 65 persons undergoing genetic testing for cancer susceptibility, participants who underestimated the emotional effects of testing were more likely to report feeling distressed afterward (\n64). Differences in ability to tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity may also have an important effect on posttest well-being (\n28).", "115) identified seven features of ethical clinical research: value to society, scientific validity, favorable risk-benefit ratio, fairness in subject selection, informed consent, demonstration of respect for enrolled subjects, and independent review. Roberts (\n116) developed a framework for analyzing the ethical acceptability of psychiatric research protocols, identifying nine key features: scientific merit and design issues; expertise, commitment, and integrity issues; risks and benefits; confidentiality; participant selection and recruitment; informed consent and decisional capacity; and incentives and other issues. A modification of Roberts's framework (\nTable 1) (\n116) that includes ethical considerations particular to genetics provides a useful model for analyzing psychiatric genetic research protocols, particularly gene-finding studies.\nA strategy for categorizing ethical considerations in clinical genotyping was proposed by Burke et al. (\n26) in 2001 (", "Nevertheless, DTC genetic testing may offer some benefits, particularly for stigmatized illnesses, because individuals seeking testing may place a very high premium on privacy. The precedent of HIV testing may be relevant in this context. An over-the-counter kit for HIV testing is currently available, and in-home HIV testing has been proposed as a way to make such testing more anonymous, thereby decreasing its stigma, increasing the empowerment of health care consumers, and increasing the use of HIV tests among young people (", "Protocols designed to gather empirical data regarding the following questions are urgently needed to ground future conceptual ethical work, provide a scientific foundation for ethical and legal guidelines, and ensure that the clinical translation of psychiatric genetic research engenders the public trust:\n\u2022.\nWhat are the actual risks and benefits of clinical psychiatric genotyping? How do those risks and benefits vary, if at all, for different psychiatric disorders, for different testing scenarios (i.e., pharmacogenetic, diagnostic, susceptibility), for different populations (i.e., prenatal testing; newborn screening; testing children, adoptees, decisionally incapable adults), and in different testing circumstances (i.e., private clinic, academic center, direct-to-consumer)?\n\u2022.\nWhat are the actual risks and benefits of clinical psychiatric genetic counseling for various indications and populations?\n\u2022.", "20). As with infectious diseases, the impact of genetic information on third parties can present an ethical dilemma between the need to protect an individual's confidentiality and the third party's \u201cright to know\u201d information that may bear on his or her health. This conflict was the central question in a New Jersey court case brought by a woman with an autosomal dominant form of colon cancer, whose father had died of the same disease. The father's physician had not informed the patient or his family that the illness was heritable and could be prevented with colectomy. The New Jersey Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that a physician had a \u201cduty to warn\u201d those at risk of avoidable harm due to genetic conditions (\n81).", "23) that could foretell the rest of one's life. Such language suggests that there will be tremendous benefits to learning genetic information, and great harm if the privacy of one's genetic \u201cfuture diary\u201d were violated.\nThis deterministic view of genetics formed the backdrop for early conceptual and empirical ethics studies. Investigations of highly penetrant disorders enabled a cataloging of risks and benefits of predictive genetic testing in the research and clinical context (\n25). These risks and benefits can be categorized as medical (i.e., interventions to reduce the impact of the illness or biological side effects of interventions) and psychosocial (i.e., peace of mind, life planning, psychological distress, social stigmatization, and discrimination) (\n13,\n26\u2013", "The ethics of clinical innovation can also provide some guidance regarding the wise use of the first applications of psychiatric genetics. A medical practice falls into the category of \u201cclinical innovation\u201d if its intention is primarily to help individual patients; it is considered \u201cclinical research\u201d if it is conducted systematically to gather generalizable knowledge. Roberts and colleagues (", "38). Will it be ethical, for example, to conduct studies in which antipsychotic medications are administered to adolescents whose genotype suggests that they have a 20% risk of schizophrenia, given that the majority of those treated will incur unnecessary biological and psychosocial risks? What if the likelihood of illness is slightly higher or lower, the disorder more or less stigmatized, or the intervention more or less benign?\nRegarding the clinical use of susceptibility genotyping, it has been argued that low predictive power will prevent such tests from ever being viable (\n39). It appears, however, that commercial interests may propel psychiatric susceptibility testing onto the market in advance of empirical evidence of clinical utility. In 2007, for example, a diagnostic genetic test for bipolar disorder based on variants in the\nGRK3 gene became available from an Internet-based laboratory (", "The flip side of this situation is the family member who does not wish to know his or her genotype, but who will be deprived of the \u201cright not to know\u201d if a relative is tested. This conflict may occur in certain unusual clinical situations, for example, when an adult grandchild of a person with a highly penetrant genetic disorder wishes to have predictive testing, but the grandchild's parent does not. Such ethical dilemmas are not likely to become commonplace, however, in psychiatric practice. The complex inheritance of mental disorders means that susceptibility testing for these illnesses will provide less directly pertinent information about risks to relatives than testing for Mendelian disorders with clear autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked patterns of inheritance.", "8) national telephone survey of Americans' stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. A random sample of 426 U.S. adults was asked to respond to a vignette about a person hospitalized for schizophrenia or depression whose illness was described as completely, partially, or not at all due to genetic factors. Participants were then asked a series of questions about how they would feel and behave toward such a person. Analysis of the responses indicated that the genetic explanation for illness led to a significant reduction in respondents' desire to see the person punished for a violent act committed as a result of the illness. Interestingly, the genetic explanation also increased respondents' desire for social distance from the ill person's sibling. The findings thus indicate that the geneticization of mental illness may decrease some aspects of stigma (punitive attitudes toward ill persons) and increase others (associative stigma toward family members).", "Another set of ethical issues concerns whether and how new applications should be introduced clinically. It will require considerable research funding and many years to gather detailed information about the psychosocial and medical outcomes of genetic counseling and testing for specific psychiatric disorders. Even our understanding of the full implications of testing for a single genetic variant may be incomplete for many years. Because of the phenomenon of genetic pleiotropy (i.e., when a single gene has multiple biological effects), a test for a genetic variant that is associated with one condition today may in the future be found to yield information about susceptibility to another condition (\n97). For example, the\nAPOE genotype is associated not only with the risk of AD but also with the risk of cardiovascular disease (\n98). Another example is the serotonin transporter gene, which is associated with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (", "69). Substantial minorities believed that they or their family members had been denied life insurance (25%), health insurance (22%), or a job (13%) because of a genetic disorder. The findings raised concerns that fears of genetic discrimination may cause many individuals to refuse participation in genetic research protocols or to forgo clinical genetic testing, creating barriers to the clinical translation of research (\n70).\nThere is some evidence that persons with genetic propensities to psychiatric disorders are especially likely to become targets of discriminatory practices. In a survey of 62 workers by Roberts et al. (\n71), respondents felt that personal genetic information showing a moderate risk of disease would be more likely to cause employment discrimination if the disease were mental rather than physical. In a questionnaire survey of 45 individuals with bipolar disorder and their spouses, Trippitelli et al. (", "EFFECTS ON RELATIVES, COMMUNITIES, AND POPULATIONS\nBy its nature, genetic information has implications and consequences for third parties: biological relatives. This phenomenon is not unique to genetics; for example, information about infectious diseases also applies to a patient's contacts (\n19,", "Should research participants be informed of the results of genotyping? If so, under what circumstances, and with what safeguards?\n\u2022.\nHow is fully informed consent best achieved for psychiatric genetic studies involving the storage of DNA for future genotyping?\n\u2022.\nWhat confidentiality protections are necessary to protect research data that may involve individuals' genotypes and also their entire medical records, including psychiatric histories?\n\u2022.\nWhat safeguards are required for psychiatric genetic research involving children and adults without decisional capacity, as well as other vulnerable populations?", "Learning about genetic information related to future health may provoke intense emotions (\n28) ranging from relief, an enhanced sense of well-being, reduced uncertainty, and improved ability to focus on future planning, at one extreme, to anxiety, embarrassment, depression, and hopelessness, at the other. Negative results on a probabilistic test may result in a false sense of security that one is free of all risk of illness, whereas positive results may cause \u201cgenetic hypochondria\u201d (\n27), if individuals become obsessively watchful for the first manifestations of a disease that may never come.\nThe reviews of research assessing the psychological impact of genetic testing by Lerman et al. (\n28) and Wiggins et al. (", "34). In the clinical setting, genetic testing for susceptibility and for drug metabolism and response is just beginning to be applied in psychiatry, but we have few or no data to guide us about their medical and psychosocial outcomes. In the future, it should be possible to make carefully reasoned judgments about the utility and morality of specific types of psychiatric genetic activities, but until then we will also grapple with ethical issues particular to an innovative and evolving technology.\nMethodologies for psychiatric genetic research have changed dramatically in recent years, the result of sequencing the human genome and completing the International HapMap project to characterize human variation across the genome (", "110). The rapid\u2014and virtually unregulated\u2014commercialization of genetic testing is worrisome, evoking memories of the naive treatment of fluoroscopy in the last century, when shoe stores across the United States offered \u201cX-ray shoe fitters\u201d as novelty devices that exposed countless individuals to significant levels of radiation (\n111,\n112). There are few published data specifically regarding the ethical issues of DTC genetic testing in psychiatry, with the exception of the questionnaire survey of a small random sample of U.S. psychiatrists of Hoop et al. (\n59), in which 100% agreed that laws and regulations should require DTC advertising for genetic testing to be truthful and to describe risks as well as benefits, and 96% agreed that there should be restrictions on the DTC sale of psychiatric genetic testing kits.", "More far-reaching ethical issues arise because genetic information may also be used to characterize larger groups of related persons, including communities and populations. There are public health benefits to conducting molecular genetic research on complex inheritance diseases using samples from ethnically and geographically diverse populations, as well as scientific benefits to using samples derived from genetically isolated populations (\n82). Such groups include the Hutterites, Old Order Amish, Ashkenazi Jews, Pima Native Americans, and isolated subpopulations in Colombia, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Iceland, Japan, and Sardinia.\nMolecular research that compares frequencies of genetic variants associated with stigmatized disorders among subpopulations may unintentionally feed racist beliefs if results are misinterpreted to mean that a given group is especially prone to the disease (", "As we have seen, psychiatric genetics provokes a multiplicity of ethical considerations deriving from the complex relationship between genetic information and a person's future mental health, the potential psychosocial impact of genetic information and effects on third parties, and the newness of molecular genetics technology in psychiatry and the uncertainty surrounding its future applications. Although many questions about the impact of these factors remain, the factors themselves can be incorporated into useful frameworks for analyzing the ethics of psychiatric genetic research protocols and clinical activities.\nEthically relevant domains in medical and psychiatric research have been described by several ethicists. Emanuel et al. (", "Despite the limitations of existing studies, their findings are consistent. The clear message is that psychiatric patients and family members are keenly interested in the clinical applications of psychiatric genetics, a message requiring that we work carefully to identify and assess the benefits, as well as the risks, of these new technologies.\nThe REVEAL study (", ". Similarly, because the great burden of psychiatric illness is due to common mental illnesses with complex inheritance, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, attention-deficit disorder, and autism, the emphasis here will be on these diseases rather than the rare, Mendelian illnesses such as Huntington's disease (HD) or Rett's disorder. The related topic of human behavioral genetics, which has been well described elsewhere (", "It is not known whether susceptibility testing for common mental disorders will have special psychological consequences beyond what has been seen with genetic testing for other disorders. Perhaps the most relevant empirical data regarding the psychological effects of susceptibility testing for a common psychiatric disorder have been gathered by an ongoing multisite study called Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer's Disease (REVEAL) (\n65\u2013\n68). In this randomized, controlled trial, individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) received genetic counseling regarding their personal AD risk based either on their age, sex, family history, and apolipoprotein E (\nAPOE) genotype (intervention arm) or on their age, sex, and family history alone (control arm)."], "title": "Ethical Considerations in Psychiatric Genetics | Focus"}, "https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101421": {"url": "https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101421", "description": "T o the E ditor: In their timely review of recent important genetic findings in psychiatric disorders\u2014specifically, common and rare copy number variants (CNVs) in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders\u2014Gershon and Alliey-Rodriguez propose that these findings \u201cmust lead to profound changes\u201d in genetic counseling and \u201cpropose that genetic counseling is more than ...", "snippets": ["PsychiatryOnline subscription options offer access to the DSM-5-TR\u00ae library, books, journals, CME, and patient resources.

In this process, more desirable traits are introduced into plants and animals such as resistance to pesticides or certain viral infections. These included traits often allow plants to thrive while killing the pests or weeds that surround them. However, this ability to change the original genetic making of an organism has become a heated topic of debate in recent years; people have begun to think of the moral implications of modifying nature\u2019s organisms for our own benefit.", "It\u2019s a well-known fact that we do not automatically believe everything we see or hear. Even when we accept something on the basis of facts or evidence, some small natural instinct continues to nab at us, telling us that something is amiss. The situation with GMOs is similar to this. While science provides the evidence that GMOs might not be as bad as they seem (and may even have health benefits), many people still choose to eat healthy and naturally by choosing organic foodstuffs over genetically modified ones. The reason being that people tend to trust their natural instincts more than just evidence and facts, which may be a good thing.\nSo, needless to say, this debate on Genetically Modified Organisms will continue for a long, long time. Until then, we can grab a bowl of popcorn and watch the scene play out - wait, was the corn organic?", "Genetically Modified Organisms, more commonly known as GMOs, have been around for quite a long time - around 30,000 years, actually. At that time, we did not know about the existence of genes. However, we did understand that we could change the appearance of a population of animals if we bred them in a certain way. Around that time, humans had begun to selectively breed wolves for desirable traits (a process through which we eventually acquired our best friend, the dog). Eventually, we learned the same about plants, and begun to use a similar process with them as well. Over the years, humans have learnt various new ways to artificially select traits in organisms, and one of them is through genetic engineering.\nBut enough history.", ". These differences in thoughts led to the beginning of a heated debate on GMOs, which is still ongoing today.", "This is where the problem begins. When genetic engineering came along, people began to look at it in a different way from the traditional breeding practices. It was okay when the plants or animals breeded in their natural way, a process which always came with a degree of uncertainty about the inheritance, or passing on, of traits. It could not always be determined whether a certain characteristic or trait would arise in the offspring or not. However, through the process of bioengineering, this uncertainty was almost reduced to zero. We had the power to alter the genetic makeup of organisms and even plant desirable characteristics into their DNA. It was like making robots out of the delicate organisms of nature, something which people almost aggressively objected to.

As a result, few studies have examined the role of rare inherited variation or its interaction with the combined effect of multiple common genetic variations that contribute to the risk of developing autism.", "\u201cThis association of general risk for ASD that was strongest in those with language delay suggests that language is actually a core component of ASD. This finding needs to be replicated in larger cohorts, especially those recruited more recently under DSM-5,\u201d Geschwind said.\nOther authors include Matilde Cirnigliaro,, Timothy Chang, Stephanie Arteaga, Elizabeth Ruzzo, Aaron Gordon, Lucy Bicks and Jennifer Lowe, all of UCLA; Laura P\u00e9rez-Cano of STALICLA DDS; and Jae-Yoon Jung and Dennis Wall of Stanford University.

This pattern was specific to autism and was not seen in other traits like educational attainment, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, suggesting there\u2019s a link between the genetic risk for autism and language delay.\nHowever, the most recent edition of the professional guidebook used by mental health providers to diagnose disorders \u2013 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) \u2013 does not consider language delay a core autism symptom, citing the variability in language ability among people with autism.", "\u201cStudy design is critical and not enough attention has been paid to studying families with more than one affected child,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics, Neurology and Psychiatry at UCLA.\nAutism is highly heritable: It is estimated at least 50% of genetic risk is predicted by common genetic variation and another 15-20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns. The remaining genetic risk is yet to be determined.\nFor this study, researchers performed whole genome sequencing in 4,551 individuals from 1,004 families with at least two children diagnosed with autism. This group included 1,836 children with autism and 418 children without an autism diagnosis.", "The researchers found seven potential genes that are predicted to increase the risk of autism: PLEKHA8, PRR25, FBXL13, VPS54, SLFN5, SNCAIP, and TGM1. This is remarkable because other studies have had to analyze much larger cohorts to identify a similar number of novel risk genes. This is because in this case, most of the new genes were supported by rare inherited DNA variations that were transmitted from parents to children with autism.", "The researchers also examined polygenic risk, in which a combination of commonly found genetic variations can raise the likelihood of developing autism. They found children who inherit rare mutations from unaffected parents in combination with polygenic risk are more likely to have autism. This helps explains why parents who carry a single rare mutation may not show signs of autism even if their children do. It also lends support to the liability threshold model, a concept in behavioral genetics that holds there is an additive effect of genes that influences the probability that someone develops a certain trait."], "title": "New genetic clues uncovered in largest study of families with multiple ..."}}
