Through use of phylogenetic tree visualisation software, records of genome sequences can be clustered into groups of identical genomes all containing the same set of mutations.

From early appearances in Eastern China early in 2020, the frequency of this mutation in the global viral population increased early on during the pandemic. G (glycine) quickly replaced D (aspartic acid) at position 614 in Europe, though more slowly in China and the rest of East Asia, supporting the hypothesis that G increased the transmission rate, which is consistent with higher viral titres and infectivity in vitro.

Development of parameters and efficient quality control measures well suited for identifying signatures of selection in such a dataset will significantly contribute to future work in this direction.", "Avenues for future exploration have been highlighted. However, there are several caveats. Firstly, the number of individuals per population for whom we have full genome sequences is presently low (N < 100). Secondly, the definition of a population in terms of origin and admixture is at times vague and increased mobility worldwide leads to elevated levels of admixture. Moreover, the numbers of variants analysed is only a small subset (<1%) of all population-specific variants since rare variants (MAF < 0.05) have not been included. Genome sequencing of global populations is providing data which will assist in teasing out ancestral populations and will shed further light on population differentiation and adaptation", "For each population, the PBS statistic for each CPS SNP-enriched 50-SNP window was calculated using the method used by Yi et al. . For the Asian populations (JPT and CHINESE) and European populations (IBS and FIN), YRI was used as the outlier population. Similarly, for the African populations YRI and LWK, the JPT population was used as the outlier. Although the choice of outlier for the populations might be questionable from a population history perspective, the distances within these populations suggest that this set can still provide reasonable estimates of branch lengths. For each 3-population set (e.g. YRI-LWK-JPT or JPT-CHB-YRI), we estimated the background distribution of the PBS scores, using 10,000 randomly-selected 50-SNP windows. We then identified score cut-offs based on the top 1%, 5% and 10% of the background distribution and estimated the number of 50-SNP windows which can be expected to be in the top 1%, 5% and 10% PBS score range for a population", "Data from these studies on genetic diversity have been instrumental in estimating the origin and history of different contemporary populations as well as shedding light on the evolutionary relationship between them .

Although there are quite a few other tests for detecting selective sweeps  which could have been employed for this dataset and might have identified a few more CPS SNP-enriched windows to be under selective sweeps, it is unlikely that they would change the landscape fundamentally and it can be safely concluded that selection is not the major factor causing CPS SNP enrichment in certain genomic regions. However, the efficiency of existing methodologies for detecting signatures of selection in datasets like the current 1000 Genomes dataset (which contain a large proportion low frequency SNPs, sequenced on a low coverage platform) is an important concern as genome wide variation in error rates might easily mask true signals and generate false positive signals of signature of selection", "We have used 1000 Genomes sequence data (release October 2012), including more than one thousand individuals from 14 populations spanning Europe, Asia, Africa and America, to identify SNPs and structural variants that are private or specific to each population and to study their genomic distribution and potential functional relevance . However, as the population sample sizes are relatively small (<100) and the sequencing is low coverage (4X-6X) for most of the 1000 Genomes data, low frequency alleles are harder to accurately identify and may be incorrectly identified as population-specific . We have therefore focused our study on common population-specific (CPS) SNPs as higher MAF population-specific SNPs are expected to be more informative and less likely to be incorrectly annotated as population-specific in this dataset", "The next major wave of information about genetic and genomic diversity in human populations came from studies based on exome and whole genome sequencing [16\u201319]. The 1000 Genomes Project, for example, in addition to identifying millions of novel SNPs and more than a million short structural variants (SSVs), showed that rare variants account for a large majority of the existing genetic diversity between individuals as well as within populations . Moreover, it was suggested that there is an excess of rare and deleterious mutations in human genomes, probably resulting from exponential population growth and weak purifying selection . Studies based on deep sequencing of selected regions from thousands of individuals further show that the majority of rare coding variants, with allele frequencies lower than 0.0005, are also population-specific and potentially deleterious "], "title": "Population-specific common SNPs reflect demographic histories and ..."}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter", "description": "The dopamine transporter (DAT, also sodium-dependent dopamine transporter) is a membrane-spanning protein coded for in humans by the SLC6A3 gene (also known as DAT1), that pumps the neurotransmitter dopamine out of the synaptic cleft back into cytosol.In the cytosol, other transporters sequester the dopamine into vesicles for storage and later release. .

From their molecular structure to their role in health and disease, these proteins exemplify the intricate complexity of the human brain. Dopamine uptake, mediated by these transporters, is a fundamental process that shapes our neural landscape.\nAs research continues to unravel the mysteries of dopamine transporters, we stand on the brink of potential breakthroughs in understanding and treating a wide range of neurological disorders. Future directions in dopamine transporter research may include more precise genetic studies to understand individual variations, advanced imaging techniques for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, and the development of highly targeted therapeutics with fewer side effects.", "The mechanism of dopamine reuptake is a complex process that relies on the electrochemical gradient across the neuronal membrane. When a dopamine molecule binds to the transporter on the extracellular side, it triggers a conformational change in the protein. This change allows the dopamine molecule to be transported across the membrane and released into the intracellular space. The process is coupled with the co-transport of sodium and chloride ions, which provides the energy needed for this uphill transport of dopamine against its concentration gradient.\nDopamine transporters play a crucial role in maintaining dopamine homeostasis in the brain. By rapidly clearing excess dopamine from the synaptic cleft, they prevent overstimulation of dopamine receptors and ensure that signaling remains within physiological limits. This homeostatic function is essential for normal brain function, as both too little and too much dopamine can lead to various neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "Dopamine transporters are specialized proteins embedded in the cell membranes of dopaminergic neurons. Their primary function is to remove excess dopamine from the synaptic cleft by rapidly shuttling it back into the presynaptic neuron. This process, known as reuptake, is vital for maintaining the delicate balance of dopamine in the brain. By regulating dopamine levels, these transporters help fine-tune neural signaling and ensure optimal brain function.\nDopamine cellular response is intricately linked to the activity of dopamine transporters. When dopamine is released into the synaptic cleft, it binds to dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a cascade of cellular events. The duration and intensity of this response are largely controlled by the efficiency of dopamine transporters in clearing excess dopamine from the synapse.\nStructure and Function of Dopamine Transporters", "The therapeutic applications of dopamine transporter-targeting drugs are particularly notable in the treatment of ADHD and depression. Stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, work primarily by inhibiting dopamine reuptake. This action increases dopamine signaling in key brain regions involved in attention and executive function. In depression, some antidepressants, particularly those in the class of norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), target dopamine transporters to enhance mood and motivation.", "The involvement of dopamine transporters in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson\u2019s disease, is an area of intense research. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to a decrease in dopamine levels and, consequently, a reduction in dopamine transporter density. This loss contributes to the motor symptoms characteristic of the disease, such as tremors and rigidity. Dopamine\u2019s role in motor control is significantly impaired in these conditions, highlighting the importance of maintaining proper dopamine transporter function.\nDopamine Transporter Imaging and Diagnostics", "The molecular structure of dopamine transporters is a marvel of biological engineering.
