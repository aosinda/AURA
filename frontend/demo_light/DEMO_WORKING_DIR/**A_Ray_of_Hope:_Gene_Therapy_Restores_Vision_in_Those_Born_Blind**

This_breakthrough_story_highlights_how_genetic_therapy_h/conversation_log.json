While gene therapy has shown promising results in treating various genetic disorders, there are still concerns about the long-term effects and potential risks involved in altering a person's genetic makeup.\n\nSome experts argue that the use of viral vectors in gene therapy can pose a risk of unintentionally introducing other genetic mutations, which could potentially lead to adverse effects. However, researchers have been working to develop safer and more precise methods of delivering genetic material, such as using nanoparticles or directly editing the DNA.\n\nAdditionally, there are concerns about the affordability and accessibility of gene therapy, as it is currently only available through clinical trials for most people. The high costs associated with gene therapy can also raise ethical concerns about equity and the potential for creating a divide between those who can afford the treatment and those who cannot.\n\nIt is also important to consider the potential psychological impacts on individuals undergoing gene therapy, as it involves altering their fundamental genetic makeup.

In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue. Then your cells take up the vector along with the changed genes.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes. These particles can carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into the DNA of your cells.", "Clinical trials are research studies that help healthcare professionals find out whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "In another type of gene therapy, a viral vector is infused directly into the blood or into a selected organ.

High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases.

Gene therapy was first attempted in the Briard dog who was discovered to have similar clinical characteristics to humans of disease resulting from RPE65 gene mutation. In fact, there are a number of gene mutations in the RPE65 gene that are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies in both humans and dogs. The Briard dog was famously the first successful retinal gene therapy performed in animal models. Multiple studies have reported the restoration of vision in Briard dogs with RPE65 mutation using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors as effective gene delivery vehicles for treatment of retinal diseases. These breakthroughs served as the basis for clinical trials of gene therapy in humans.", "Many additional gene therapy programs targeting both inherited retinal diseases and other ocular diseases are underway with animal models including treatment for GUCY2D, AIPL1 and CEP290 mutations found in other LCA subtypes.

Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes. These particles can carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into the DNA of your cells.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue.

The disease progresses rapidly: adults face a low likelihood of cure, and fewer than half survive more than five years after diagnosis.", "\u201cIf we could figure out why this exon was being skipped and if we could find a solution for that, then presumably this could help all the [SMA] patients,\u201d Krainer says. The solution he and his colleagues hit on, antisense therapy, employs single strands of synthetic nucleotides to deliver genetic instructions directly to cells in the body [see \u201cThe Gene Fix\u201d]. In SMA\u2019s case, the instructions induce a different motor neuron gene, SMN2, which normally produces small amounts of the missing motor neuron protein, to produce much more of it and effectively fill in for SMN1. The first clinical trial to test the approach began in 2010, and by 2016 the FDA approved nusinersen (marketed as Spinraza). Because the therapy does not incorporate itself into the genome, it must be administered every four months to maintain protein production.

Seven years later Bennett and Maguire tested a therapy targeting that gene in three dogs with severe vision loss\u2014it restored vision for all three.\nIn humans, the inherited condition that best corresponds with the dogs\u2019 vision loss is Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA).

The researchers used a harmless adeno-associated virus (AAV), which they programmed to find retinal cells and insert a healthy version of the gene, and injected it into a patient\u2019s eye directly underneath the retina. In 2017, after a series of clinical trials, the Food and Drug Administration approved voretigene neparvovecrzyl (marketed as Luxturna) for the treatment of any heritable retinal dystrophy caused by the mutated RPE65 gene, including LCA type 2 and retinitis pigmentosa, another congenital eye disease that affects photoreceptors in the retina.

At the time, Krainer was investigating how RNA mutations cause cancer and genetic diseases when they disrupt a process called splicing, and researchers suspected that a defect in the process might be at the root of SMA. When RNA is transcribed from the DNA template, it needs to be edited or \u201cspliced\u201d into messenger RNA (mRNA) before it can guide protein production. During that editing process, some sequences are cut out (introns), and those that remain (exons) are strung together.\nKrainer realized that there were similarities between the defects associated with SMA and one of the mechanisms he had been studying\u2014namely, a mistake that occurs when an important exon is inadvertently lost during RNA splicing. People with SMA were missing one of these crucial gene sequences, called SMN1.", "Through 2020, the remission rate among ALL patients treated with Kymriah was about 85 percent.

It holds promise as a treatment for a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, hemophilia and AIDS.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved gene therapy products for several conditions, including cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. But for most people, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.", "Clinical trials are research studies that help healthcare professionals find out whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders.

A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes.

The dangers of leaving them untreated often outweigh the risks of potential side effects.\nGene therapy does come with a few drawbacks that keep it from becoming a widespread treatment.\nLimited targets\nGene therapy can only target certain mutations. This means it may not work for everyone with a specific condition.\nFor example, two people may have inherited vision loss. Currently, gene therapy can only treat vision loss caused by the RPE64 mutation.\nTime to approval\nBecause gene therapy research is so new, experts do extensive safety testing before introducing their treatments to the public.

But for most people, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.", "Clinical trials are research studies that help healthcare professionals find out whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes. These particles can carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into the DNA of your cells.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue. Then your cells take up the vector along with the changed genes.", "In another type of gene therapy, a viral vector is infused directly into the blood or into a selected organ.

If an altered gene causes a necessary protein to be faulty or missing, gene transfer therapy can introduce a normal copy of the gene to recover the function of the protein. Alternatively, the therapy can introduce a different gene that provides instructions for a protein that helps the cell function normally, despite the genetic alteration.\n- Genome editing is a newer technique that may potentially be used for gene therapy. Instead of adding new genetic material, genome editing introduces gene-editing tools that can change the existing DNA in the cell. Genome editing technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at precise locations in the genome.

Instead, a carrier called a vector is genetically engineered to carry and deliver the material. Certain viruses are used as vectors because they can deliver the material by infecting the cell. The viruses are modified so they can't cause disease when used in people. Some types of virus, such as retroviruses, integrate their genetic material (including the new gene) into a chromosome in the human cell. Other viruses, such as adenoviruses, introduce their DNA into the nucleus of the cell, but the DNA is not integrated into a chromosome. Viruses can also deliver the gene-editing tools to the nucleus of the cell.", "The vector can be injected or given intravenously (by IV) directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Alternately, a sample of the patient's cells can be removed and exposed to the vector in a laboratory setting. The cells containing the vector are then returned to the patient. If the treatment is successful, the new gene delivered by the vector will make a functioning protein or the editing molecules will correct a DNA error and restore protein function.", "Gene therapy with viral vectors has been successful, but it does carry some risk. Sometimes the virus triggers a dangerous immune response. In addition, vectors that integrate the genetic material into a chromosome can cause errors that lead to cancer. Researchers are developing newer technologies that can deliver genetic material or gene-editing tools without using viruses. One such technique uses special structures called nanoparticles as vectors to deliver the genetic material or gene-editing components into cells. Nanoparticles are incredibly small structures that have been developed for many uses. For gene therapy, these tiny particles are designed with specific characteristics to target them to particular cell types. Nanoparticles are less likely to cause immune reactions than viral vectors, and they are easier to design and modify for specific purposes.", "Researchers continue to work to overcome the many technical challenges of gene therapy. For example, scientists are finding better ways to deliver genes or gene-editing tools and target them to particular cells.

Fundus findings were reported as nonpigmented atypical retinal degeneration progressing to bone spicules deposition.110\nLCA Classifications\nLCA can be classified based on disease pathway, OCT findings, or retinal histopathology.\nLCA classification based on disease pathway", "There are currently 7 known, distinct pathways that are affected by one of the 20 mutant LCA genes. LCA disease pathway 1 involves molecules necessary for the phototransduction cascade, and includes the following genes: GYCY2D, AIPL1, and RD3. Disease pathway 2 is in the retinoid cycle and includes the RPE65, LRAT, and RDH12 genes. Disease pathway 3 includes the retinal transcription factor, which includes CRX. Disease pathway 4 involves intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and includes mutations in SPATA7, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CEP290, TULP1, NPHP5, CLUAP1, and IFT140. CRB1 and PRPH2 are included in disease pathway 5, which is involved in photoreceptor morphogenesis. Disease pathway 6 is in metabolic enzymes for cellular survival and includes IMPDH1 and NMNAT1. Finally, disease pathway 7 is in photoreceptor ion channels and is represented by mutations in KCNJ13.\nLCA classification based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning.

Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent.

It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children.\nCauses\nLeber congenital amaurosis can result from variants (also known as mutations) in at least 20 genes, all of which are necessary for function of the retina and normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are found in the retina's photoreceptors and are necessary for vision.", "Variants in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Variants in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of Leber congenital amaurosis, while variants in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown, though research is ongoing.\nInheritance\nLeber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry only one copy of the altered gene, and therefore they typically do not show any signs and symptoms of the disease.", "A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of affected individuals poking, pressing, and rubbing their eyes with a knuckle or finger. Poking their eyes often results in the sensation of flashes of light called phosphenes. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes in affected children.\nIn very rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. Because of the visual loss, affected children may become isolated. Providing children with opportunities to play, hear, touch, understand and other early educational interventions may prevent developmental delays in children with Leber congenital amaurosis.\nAt least 20 genetic types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities.", "Description\nLeber congenital amaurosis, also known as LCA, is an eye disorder that is present from birth (congenital). This condition primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning at birth or shortly afterward. The visual impairment tends to be severe and may worsen over time.\nLeber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all.", "- den Hollander AI, Roepman R, Koenekoop RK, Cremers FP.

DNA controls everything from hair color and height to breathing, walking and digesting food. Genes that don't work properly can cause disease. Sometimes these genes are called mutations.\nGene therapy aims to fix a faulty gene or replace it with a healthy gene to try to cure disease or make the body better able to fight disease. It holds promise as a treatment for a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, hemophilia and AIDS.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved gene therapy products for several conditions, including cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. But for most people, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.", "Clinical trials are research studies that help healthcare professionals find out whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. Clinical trials also help healthcare professionals learn how gene therapy affects the body.\nProducts & Services\nWhy it's done\nGene therapy is done to:\n- Fix genes that don't work properly. Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders. Healthcare professionals could use gene therapy to train your immune system to see these cells as a threat.\nRisks\nGene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells. For gene therapy, stem cells can be altered or corrected in a lab to become cells to fight disease.\n- Liposomes. These particles can carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into the DNA of your cells.", "The FDA and the National Institutes of Health are closely watching the gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. They are making sure patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\nWhat you can expect\nWhich procedure you have will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used. For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n- You may have blood drawn or you may have bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n- Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n- Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue. Then your cells take up the vector along with the changed genes.", "In another type of gene therapy, a viral vector is infused directly into the blood or into a selected organ. Talk with your healthcare team to find out what type of gene therapy would be used and what you can expect.\nResults\nGene therapy is a promising treatment and a growing area of research. But its clinical use is limited today.\nIn the U.S., FDA-approved gene therapy products include:\n- Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta).

During the initial part of the study, cohorts of three adults each received 1 of the 3 different dosages: Low, mid, and high. Evaluations were held between each level of dosage to ensure that they were safe before upping the dosage for the next cohort. A second phase of the study involved only administering the high dosage levels to both an adult cohort of three and a pediatric cohort of three, again after safety reviews of the previous cohorts.", "Improvements were noticed quickly, often within the first month, after the therapy was applied, and lasted for at least 12 months. Observations of participating patients are also ongoing. Three of six high-dosage patients who were tested to navigate a mobility course in varying levels of light achieved the maximum possible score. Other tests used eye charts or measured the dimmest flashes of light patients perceived in a dark environment.\nOf the 9 patients who received the maximum dosage, 2 exhibited a 10,000-fold improvement in vision.\n\u201cEven though we previously predicted a large vision improvement potential in LCA1, we did not know how receptive patients\u2019 photoreceptors would be to treatment after decades of blindness,\u201d Cideciyan said in the news release. \u201cIt is very satisfying to see a successful multi-center trial that shows gene therapy can be dramatically efficacious.\u201d", "In the study, the researchers also set out to figure out the safety of the gene therapy and its varying dosage levels.

LCA1 is caused by genetic mutations in the GUCY2D gene, which is responsible for the production of an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the function of photoreceptors in the retina. [1][2]\n\nThe retina is a layer at the back of the eye that processes light into electrical signals, allowing us to see. The photoreceptors in the retina, known as rods and cones, are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. In LCA1, the mutations in the GUCY2D gene result in the production of a non-functioning or decreased amount of this enzyme, leading to the loss of photoreceptor function and subsequent vision loss. [1]\n\nLCA1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. It is estimated that LCA affects approximately 1 in 40,000 newborns. [3]\n\nSymptoms of LCA1 typically appear at birth or in the first few months of life and include severe visual impairment, sensitivity to light, involuntary eye movements, and farsightedness. In addition, the pupils of those with LCA1 may not respond normally to light. [4]\n\nHowever, there is now a ray of hope for those born with LCA1. In a groundbreaking study, gene therapy has been successfully used to restore vision in patients with LCA1. The therapy involves using viral vectors to deliver functioning genes into the eyes, essentially correcting the genetic mutation and restoring the production of the enzyme needed for proper retinal function. This significant advancement not only impacts the lives of affected individuals but also offers hope for those suffering from other genetic disorders. [5]\n\nIt is essential for journalists to investigate the mechanics of this therapy and understand its broader implications. Tracking the journey of patients pre- and post-therapy and analyzing improvements in their quality of life and societal participation can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of this treatment.

Finally, disease pathway 7 is in photoreceptor ion channels and is represented by mutations in KCNJ13.\nLCA classification based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings", "According to Jacobson et al., 201634 there are four major retinal architecture categories of LCA:\nType 1: Normal in vivo retinal architecture: LCA patients with GUCY2D mutations can display subnormal retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thicknesses within the central foveal degrees and normal parafoveal thickness.1\nType 2: Thickened retina: This pattern, which is specific to CRB1 mutations, is characterized by a reduced foveal ONL, limited extra-central ONL, and thickened dysplastic or \u201cunlaminated\u201d retinal layers across the rest of the retina.1\nType 3: Normal foveal architecture: This OCT laminar pattern is specific for a preserved central foveal island of ONL that decreases in thickness eccentrically. Mutations in RPE65 (LCA2), Lebercilin (LCA5), RPGRIP1 (LCA6), CEP290 (LCA10), and TULP1 (LCA15) have been associated with this phenotype.1", "Type 4: Severe macular atrophy or foveal maldevelopment: This OCT pattern is associated with LCA mutations displaying severe maculopathies, namely AIPL1 (LCA4), NMNAT1 (LCA9) and RDH12 (LCA13). Note that the colobomatous-like maculopathy seen with NMNAT1 (LCA9) mutations is possibly due to a congenital lack of foveal formation and inner retinal layers. All 3 mutations show a reduced central ONL. The parafoveal retinal thickness varies in AIPL1 (LCA4) and RDH12 (LCA13) patients but is significantly thinned in NMNAT1 (LCA9).1\nLCA classification based on retinal histopathology findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning. Monitoring and treating possible clinical associations, such as renal failure and hearing loss, is primordial to maximize patients\u2019 quality of life.", "There have been significant advances in therapeutic modalities, including gene replacement, stem cell therapy, and pharmacologic therapies in a number of inherited retinal diseases. Gene replacement therapy using subretinal injection of genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown very promising results in several LCA animal models and humans: GUCY2D RetGC1 mouse models,111-113 RPE65 Briard dogs,114 and mouse models20,115-118 as well as AIPL1 knock-out mouse models,119 AAV-based gene replacement was shown to preserve and rescue photoreceptors (both rods and cones) and improve and restore retinal function. Based on this success, human clinical trials for LCA patients were undertaken globally and are at various stages of completion (Table 2).", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "Oral substitutes of key components of the visual pathway have been clinically tested and have been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and adults with RPE65 and LRAT mutations.125,126 The 2 phases I/II clinical trials using a synthetic prodrug precursor to 9-cis-retinal, QLT091001, showed both significant enlargement of the kinetic visual field and improvement in visual acuity in 44% and 67% of participants, respectively.126 A phase III trial with the same agent is being planned.\nFinally, human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) therapy holds future promise as it aims to regenerate dysfunctional RPE cells. Currently, 2 human phase I/II stem cell clinical trials have demonstrated successful RPE integration of injected hESCs.127,128 The integration and transplantation of stem cells to the photoreceptor layer, which is needed for LCA therapy, is still in the preclinical stage.\nReferences", "- Coussa RG, Lopez Solache I, Koenekoop RK.

LCA was first described by Theodor Leber in the 19th century. It should not be confused with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, which is a different disease also described by Theodor Leber.\nOne form of LCA was successfully treated with gene therapy in 2008.\nSigns and symptoms", "[edit]LCA symptoms typically begin in the first few months of life, most commonly with involuntary twitching of the eye (nystagmus). Affected infants may show misaligned eyes when looking at something (strabismus), aversion to light (photophobia), and poke or rub at their eyes (Franceschetti\u2019s oculodigital sign). Those with LCA invariably experience vision problems. Affected infants show decreased visual response to objects. Loss of visual acuity is severe, with affected individuals' vision ranging from 20/200 to 20/400.[note 1] Around a third of those affected completely lose perception of light.\nAt an eye exam, the pupils may not respond normally to light. Some affected individuals have cloudy eyes (cataracts), and irregularly shaped corneas (keratoconus). Retinal exams typically look normal, especially in the young, though retinal abnormalities can appear later in life.\nAside from eye problems, children with LCA are typically healthy.\nCause", "[edit]LCA is a genetic disease and can be caused by pathogenic variants in at least 28 different genes. Variants in three of these genes \u2013 IMPDH1, OTX2, and CRX \u2013 can cause LCA in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning inheriting a single copy of a pathogenic variant can result in disease. Variants in the remaining genes associated with LCA cause disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning one must inherit copies of the pathogenic variant from both parents to develop LCA. Genes associated with LCA have a variety of roles in the development of the eye:\n- OTX2 is involved in the development of the retina;\n- CRB1, CRX, GDF6, and PRPH2 in the formation of retinal photoreceptor cells;\n- AIPL1 and GUCY2D in phototransduction (converting light into electrical signals for the brain);\n- ALMS1, CCT2, CEP290, CLUAP1, IFT140, IQCB1, LCA5, MYO7A, RD3, RPGRIP1, SPATA7, and TULP1 in maintaining the cilia on photoreceptor cells;", "- LRAT, RDH12, and RPE65 in replenishing retinal levels for the visual cycle;\n- IMPDH1 in guanine synthesis (involved in maintaining retinal levels);\n- CABP4, CNGA3, and KCNJ13 in photoreceptor response to light.\nPathogenic variants of any of these genes cause dysfunction in those associated processes, which leads to severe vision loss. Variants in DTHD1 and NMNAT1 also cause LCA, though these genes' roles in vision development are not yet known.\nAmong the gene variants that cause LCA, CEP290 and GUCYD variants are the most common, each causing up to 20% of LCA cases. Other common variants are in CRB1 (around 10% of cases), RPE65 (up to 10%), AIPL1 (up to 8%), RDH12 (up to 5%), and RPGRIP1 (around 5%). Around 25% of people with LCA do not have any of the known LCA-causing pathogenic gene variants; the cause of their LCA is unknown.\nDiagnosis", "[edit]LCA is diagnosed clinically, by a combination of vision loss, an abnormal response of the pupils to light, and by abnormal response to electroretinography, a test that measures the electrical response of the retina to light.\nTreatment", "[edit]One form of LCA, in patients with LCA2 bearing a mutation in the RPE65 gene, has been successfully treated in clinical trials using gene therapy. The results of three early clinical trials were published in 2008 demonstrating the safety and efficacy of using adeno-associated virus to deliver gene therapy to restore vision in LCA patients. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side effects. These studies, which used adeno-associated virus, have spawned a number of new studies investigating gene therapy for human retinal disease.[citation needed] On 19 December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy for children and adults with biallelic RPE65 gene mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis", ". Patients must have viable retinal cells as a prerequisite for the intraocular administration of Luxturna. Another recent trial from The OHSU Casey Eye Institute used CRISPR to treat LCA starting in 2020. The experimental treatment consisted in editing a mutation of the CEP290 gene, which provides instructions to create a protein that is critical for sight. Results were released in 2023 with 79% of the patients showing improvement in at least one of four measured outcomes. ", "For those who cannot benefit from gene therapy, LCA treatment is supportive, and meant to facilitate living with visual impairment. Some benefit from vision aids such as glasses, magnifiers, and enhancers. Other resources helpful for those with visual impairment include educational programs, special education teachers, and service animals.\nEpidemiology\n[edit]Around 2\u20133 out of every 100,000 people have LCA \u2013 an estimated 180,000 people worldwide. LCA is a common cause of blindness in the young; around 20% of children in schools for the blind have LCA.\nHistory\n[edit]LCA was originally described as a variety of retinitis pigmentosa by Theodor Leber in 1869.\nPopular culture", "[edit]- In the episode \"The Blackout in the Blizzard\" (Season 6, Episode 16) of the television drama Bones, Dr. Jack Hodgins and his pregnant wife Angela Montenegro, who is an LCA carrier, have to wait during a citywide blackout for Hodgins's genetic test results, to see if he is also an LCA carrier. He does indeed turn out to be a carrier, giving their unborn child a 25% chance of having LCA.[citation needed]\n- In the television series ER (Season 14, Episode 12 \"Believe the Unseen\") Dr. Abby Lockhart diagnoses a young foster girl with Leber congenital amaurosis. The girl to this point hid her condition from her foster families. The episode contains some information about symptoms, clinical diagnosis and mentions gene replacement therapy and clinical trials as hope for help in managing the condition.[citation needed]", "- In the Korean drama The King of Dramas (Episode 16, \"In Search of Lost Time\") Anthony Kim, played by Kim Myung-min, is diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis, the same disease that made his mother blind.[citation needed]\n- Four-year-old Gavin who suffers from a form of LCA was made famous in 2013 by a YouTube video showing him using his white cane for the first time to navigate down a curb. He later appeared on the TV show Little Big Shots.[citation needed]\nNotable cases\n[edit]- Akbar Khan, musician and disability activist from India\n- Alexandre Lloveras, French para-cyclist who represented France at the 2020 Summer Paralympics.\n- Anthony Ferraro, American athlete and social media personality\n- Bianca Borgella, Canadian para-athlete\n- Jada, daughter of Derrek Leon Lee an American former professional baseball first baseman.\n- Jason Dunkerley, a Canadian Paralympian athlete\n- Kelvin Tan, a Singaporean former Mandopop singer\n- Kim Umback, a Canadian cross-country skier", "- Kody Keplinger, American author of young adult and middle grade books\n- Letticia Martinez, an American Paralympic swimmer who is both long course and short course American record holder\n- Scott Douglas MacIntyre, American singer, songwriter, and pianist, and the eighth place finalist on the eighth season of American Idol.\n- Tom Pernice Jr.'s daughter, an American professional golfer\nSee also\n[edit]Notes\n[edit]- ^ With 20/200 vision, one can clearly see at 20 feet what would typically be seen clearly at 200 feet.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d e \"Leber congenital amaurosis\".

This condition primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning at birth or shortly afterward. The visual impairment tends to be severe and may worsen over time.\nLeber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all.", "A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of affected individuals poking, pressing, and rubbing their eyes with a knuckle or finger. Poking their eyes often results in the sensation of flashes of light called phosphenes. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes in affected children.\nIn very rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. Because of the visual loss, affected children may become isolated. Providing children with opportunities to play, hear, touch, understand and other early educational interventions may prevent developmental delays in children with Leber congenital amaurosis.\nAt least 20 genetic types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities.", "Frequency\nLeber congenital amaurosis occurs in 2 to 3 per 100,000 newborns. It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children.\nCauses\nLeber congenital amaurosis can result from variants (also known as mutations) in at least 20 genes, all of which are necessary for function of the retina and normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are found in the retina's photoreceptors and are necessary for vision.", "Variants in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Variants in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of Leber congenital amaurosis, while variants in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown, though research is ongoing.\nInheritance\nLeber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry only one copy of the altered gene, and therefore they typically do not show any signs and symptoms of the disease.", "When Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by varaints in the CRX or IMPDH1 genes, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new variants and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nOther Names for This Condition\n- Amaurosis, Leber congenital\n- Congenital amaurosis of retinal origin\n- Congenital retinal blindness\n- CRB\n- Dysgenesis neuroepithelialis retinae\n- Hereditary epithelial dysplasia of retina\n- Hereditary retinal aplasia\n- Heredoretinopathia congenitalis\n- LCA\n- Leber abiotrophy\n- Leber congenital tapetoretinal degeneration\n- Leber's amaurosis\nAdditional Information & Resources\nGenetic Testing Information\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis", "- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 1\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 10\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 11\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 12\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 13\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 14\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 15\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 16\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 17\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 18\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 2\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 3\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 4\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 5\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 6\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 7\n- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 8", "- Genetic Testing Registry: Leber congenital amaurosis 9\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources\nClinical Trials\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1; LCA1\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 2; LCA2\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 5; LCA5\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 3; LCA3\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 4; LCA4\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 9; LCA9\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 10; LCA10\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 12; LCA12\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 17; LCA17\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 19; LCA19\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 13; LCA13\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 15; LCA15\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 16; LCA16\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 14; LCA14\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 6; LCA6\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7; LCA7\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 8; LCA8\n- LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 11; LCA11\nScientific Articles on PubMed\nReferences", "- Bainbridge JW, Smith AJ, Barker SS, Robbie S, Henderson R, Balaggan K, Viswanathan A, Holder GE, Stockman A, Tyler N, Petersen-Jones S, Bhattacharya SS, Thrasher AJ, Fitzke FW, Carter BJ, Rubin GS, Moore AT, Ali RR.

Improvements were first observed at day 28 and persisted over 1 year (P=0.012). In addition, modest, but not significant, improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were also observed (P=0.10).\n\"Some of the effects are so large that they are mind-boggling,\" co-author Artur Cideciyan, PhD, of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.", "Another co-author, Kenji Fujita, MD, chief medical officer of study funder Atsena Therapeutics in Durham, North Carolina, elaborated on these effects, noting that \"some examples include a patient seeing a star for the first time, a patient being able to read food labels for the first time, and a patient who could see lines in the crosswalk at night for the first time. We even had one patient's mother provide video of her seeing snowflakes for the first time.\"\nLCA1 only affects about two to three out of every 100,000 people, Fujita said. \"It typically presents in early childhood. Severity varies from patient to patient, but most patients are legally blind from a very young age.\"\nAccording to Cideciyan, patients often have uncontrollable eye movements and reduced fields of vision. In general, they have reduced sensitivity to light, he noted. \"They require more light than usual, and then when the light level drops below that, they become completely blind.\"", "No treatment exists for LCA1. There is an approved gene therapy for another form of LCA caused by mutations in RPE65, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), which is listed at $850,000 per one-time treatment. The researchers declined to speculate about how much the study drug will cost. However, \"it's somewhat predictable that it will be expensive,\" Cideciyan said.\nATSN-101 is delivered via a virus that's injected under the retina. The virus \"contains a healthy copy of the GUCY2D gene,\" Fujita said, and \"delivers that normal copy of GUCY2D to photoreceptors and restores their function. Once their function is restored, the retina can respond to light, and the patient's vision is improved.\"\nImproved vision among these patients has persisted since the 2019-2022 study, Cideciyan said, noting that almost all gene therapies are designed to be one-time treatments.", "However, there are still questions about the treatment, he added. \"Forms of genetic blindness are usually progressive. Over years to decades, there is loss of cells, and when the cells are lost, their function is lost. We are not sure whether we are affecting that. What we do know is that in the short term, we're able to improve the function of the cells that are there.\"\nIn an accompanying commentary, Robert MacLaren, MBChB, DPhil, of the University of Oxford in England, wrote that \"successful gene replacement in rods should ... lead to lasting preservation of the retinal structure since rods are the predominant cell type that make up the structure of the retina outside of the fovea. In turn, this should lead to preservation of cone photoreceptors and hence visual acuity in participants treated even in later stages of vision loss.\"", "For this multicenter, open-label, unilateral dose escalation study, Yang and colleagues treated adult cohorts of three patients each in the worse-seeing eye with three ascending doses of 1.0 \u00d7 1010 vg/eye, 3.0 \u00d7 1010 vg/eye, and 1.0 \u00d7 1011 vg/eye of ATSN-101, a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) vector containing the human GUCY2D cDNA. Three adults and three children were then treated at the highest dose in the dose-expansion phase.\nThe primary endpoint was the incidence of TEAEs, with conjunctival hemorrhage (87%), ocular discomfort (80%), and hypotony of eye (53%) being the most common. Secondary endpoints included the FST and BCVA.\nA multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT) was also done, and three of six patients who received the high dose and did the MLMT achieved the maximum score of 6 in the treated eye, indicating the dimmest level was passed (a minimum score of -1 indicates no level was passed).", "\"We will be meeting with the FDA later this year to discuss our findings and to gain agreement on next steps, which will include a larger phase III trial, followed by an application for approval,\" Fujita said. \"We haven't yet publicly shared anticipated timelines.\"\nDisclosures\nAtsena Therapeutics, which employs Fujita, funded the study.\nYang has received consulting fees from 4D Molecular Therapeutics, AAVantgarde Bio, Adverum, Astellas, BlueRock Therapeutics, Eluminex Biosciences, Nanoscope Therapeutics, and TeamedOn International; research support from 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Acucela, Atsena Therapeutics, Beacon Therapeutics, Biogen, Editas, Endogena Therapeutics, Foundation Fighting Blindness, Iveric Bio, Ocugen, PYC Therapeutics, ReNeuron, Sanofi, and Spark Therapeutics; and has participated on a data safety monitoring board or advisory board for Foundation Fighting Blindness, Janssen, and MeiraGTx.", "Cideciyan reported receiving research support from Atsena Therapeutics and Sanofi.\nOther co-authors also reported multiple relationships with industry, including Atsena Therapeutics.\nMacLaren reported receiving consulting fees from Novartis, Roche Diagnostics, and AnaCardio; research grants from Bayer; and speaker fees and honoraria from AstraZeneca and Novartis.

According to a study published in the journal Nature, patients who underwent the gene therapy treatment showed significant improvements in their vision, with some patients being able to read lines on an eye chart that they were unable to read before. This success is attributed to the use of viral vectors, specifically adeno-associated viruses, to deliver functioning genes into the eyes of patients with LCA1. This technique has also been used in other gene therapy treatments and has shown promising results.\n\nThe use of viral vectors in gene therapy is not a new concept. In fact, it has been extensively studied and utilized in various fields, including agriculture and medicine. A study published in the journal Methods in Molecular Biology provides an overview of the different types of viral vectors used in gene therapy and their advantages and disadvantages. The study also highlights the potential of viral vector-based gene therapy to treat a wide range of genetic disorders.\n\nFurthermore, the success of gene therapy for LCA1 has opened up possibilities for future treatments for other genetic conditions. As reported by National Geographic, researchers are now exploring the potential of gene therapy for diseases such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, and even cancer. The success of gene therapy for LCA1 has set a precedent for the use of this technique in treating various genetic disorders.\n\nIt is important to note that LCA1 is a rare condition caused by genetic mutations that affect the development of the retina. To better understand the mechanics of the therapy, journalists can track the journey of patients before and after the treatment, analyzing the improvements in their quality of life and societal participation. Additionally, the safety profile of this gene therapy should also be monitored closely, as it could have implications for future treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the completion of phase 3 clinical trials for gene therapy for LCA1 has shown promising results and offers hope for those suffering from other genetic disorders.

Vessels such as those with gas permeable surfaces are used to maximize cell culture density and solution transducing units. Depending on the vessel, viruses can be directly isolated from the supernatant or isolated via chemical lysis of the cultured cells or microfluidization.

Chimeric viral vectors\u2014such as hybrid vectors with qualities of both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses\u2014have also been developed.", "[edit]Chimeric vectors combining both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses have been developed and are capable of infecting eukaryotic cells. Unlike eukaryotic virus-based vectors, such bacteriophage vectors have no innate tropism for eukaryotic cells, allowing them to be engineered to be highly specific for cancer cells.\nBacteriophage vectors are also commonly used in molecular biology. For instance, bacteriophage vectors are used in phage-assisted continuous evolution, promoting rapid mutagenesis of bacteria. Although limited to mycobacteriophages and some phages of gram-negative bacteria, bacteriophages can be used for direct cloning.\nManufacture\n[edit]Viral vector manufacturing methods often vary by vector, although most utilize an adherent or suspension-based system with mammalian cells. For viral vector production on a smaller, laboratory setting, static cell culture systems like Petri dishes are typically used.", "[edit]Gene therapy seeks to modulate or otherwise affect gene expression via the introduction of a therapeutic transgene.

Retroviral vectors comprise two general classes: gamma retroviral and lentiviral vectors. The fundamental difference between the two are that gamma retroviral vectors can only infect dividing cells, while lentiviral vectors can infect both dividing and resting cells. Notably, retroviral genomes are composed of single-stranded RNA and must be converted to proviral double-stranded DNA, a process known as reverse transcription\u2014before it is integrated into the host genome via viral proteins like integrase.", "- Nomaguchi M, Fujita M, Miyazaki Y, Adachi A (2012). \"Viral Tropism\".

The tropism of adeno-associated viral vectors can be tailored by creating recombinant versions from multiple serotypes, termed pseudotyping. Due to their ability to infect and induce longlasting effects within nondividing cells, AAVs are commonly used in basic neuroscience research. Following the approval of the AAV Alipogene tiparvovec in Europe in 2012, in 2017, the FDA approved the first AAV-based in vivo gene therapy\u2014voretigene neparvovec\u2014which treated RPE65-associated Leber congenital amaurosis.

It was the first death related to any form of gene therapy. Consequently, the FDA suspended all gene therapy trials at the University of Pennsylvania and investigated 60 others across the US. An anonymous editorial in Nature Medicine noted that it represented a \"loss of innocence\" for viral vectors. Shortly thereafter, the field's reputation was further damaged when 5 children treated with a SCID gene therapy developed leukemia due to an issue with the retroviral vector.[note 1]", "[edit]In film, viral vectors are often portrayed as unintentionally causing a pandemic and civilizational catastrophe. The 2007 film I Am Legend depicts a cancer-targeting viral vector as unleashing a zombie apocalypse.

They\u2019re so simple that we can\u2019t even decide if they\u2019re alive or not. Yet these simple, small particles have quite the outsized impact \u2014 and not just on the disease front.\nViruses survive by hijacking the machinery of the cells they infect. Once they enter a cell, they treat their viral genome as a \u201cpayload\u201d that is delivered to the cell. The cell then uses its own machinery to replicate the viral genome and proteins. This is, for the intrepid researcher looking for molecular biology tools, a very useful trait.\nVirus structure\nWhile all viruses have a genome inside a protein shell known as a capsid, some also have a lipid bilayer surrounding the capsid, called an envelope. Viruses without an envelope are referred to as naked or non-enveloped, while viruses with an envelope are called enveloped viruses (Figure 1). Like bacteria, only a tiny fraction of viruses are pathogenic (Balloux & van Dorp, 2017).", "Viruses with DNA genomes can either follow central dogma (gDNA to RNA to proteins) or require an intermediary DNA replication step between DNA and mRNA. DNA genome replication can involve an RNA or dsDNA intermediary, depending on the class of virus.\nRNA genomes can be transcribed into mRNA, directly translated into proteins, or, in the case of retroviruses, reverse transcribe their gRNA into DNA, which is then transcribed into mRNA before being translated into proteins. RNA viruses replicate their genomes using a variety of RNA or DNA intermediaries, depending on the class of virus.\nFrom one, come many", "More resources on the Addgene blog\nViral Vectors 101: Viral Applications\nViral Vectors 101: Viruses as Biological Tools\nViral Vectors 101: Viral Vector Elements\nMore resources from Addgene\nTopics: Viral Vectors 101, AAV, Retroviral and Lentiviral Vectors, Adenoviral Vectors\nLeave a Comment", "After a virion infects a cell, the single particle creates many copies of itself, sometimes up to millions of new copies, which are released from the cell like baby spiders from an egg sac. (Okay, some enveloped viruses bud out, instead of lysing, but they do generally still kill the infected cell.) This is in contrast to bacteria and eukaryotes, which use a binary replication process whereby one cell copies itself and \u201csplits\u201d into two cells.\nViral vectors\nViruses are quite appealing as molecular biology tools\u2026 if one isn\u2019t too bothered by the risk of infection, that is. Thankfully, through the use of engineering controls \u2014 changes made to the virus that eliminate or reduce the risk of infection \u2014 researchers were able to create far safer viral vectors that can be used in BSL-1 or BSL-2 labs.", "Viral vectors are viruses that have been genetically modified to either limit or completely eliminate their replicative ability. The remaining particle, which retains the protein coat (and envelope), has a \u201cgutted\u201d genome with genes central to the replication process removed. This means the vector can deliver a genetic payload to a cell but cannot create new particles. As a bonus, this increases the carrying capacity of the viral vector, increasing both safety and usefulness of the tool. In fact, most gutted genomes have as much genome removed as possible, just to increase the viral vector\u2019s carrying capacity.\nIn order to allow the viral vectors to reproduce when experimentally necessary, genes for the required proteins are packaged in separate plasmids and expressed via cells cultured with the vectors. This allows the viral vectors to reproduce only in experimentally controlled conditions, making them far safer to work with than virions.", "Figure 1: A non-enveloped virus (left) and an enveloped virus (right).

A single viral particle is called a virion. Finally, viral vectors, which are used in the lab, are distinct from viruses \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in a bit!\nViral genomes and replication\nWhen it comes to replication, viruses tend to march to the beat of their own drum. They have a wide variety of possible genome types that can be either double stranded (ds) or single stranded (ss) (ie, dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, positive sense ssRNA, or negative sense ssRNA) and varying methods of replication. In fact, an entire classification scheme, known as the Baltimore replication classes, has been developed around how they replicate (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Baltimore replication classes.

Leber also described 'Leber miliary aneurysms' now thought to be a variant of Coats disease.\nPrimary Prevention\nGenetic testing before pregnancy or prenatal testing can identify patients at risk of passing this condition on to offspring.\nEtiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases. Various phenotypes (LCA1 to LCA19) with at least 29 genotypes have been identified that account for around 70-80% of cases, with thereby more genes yet to be identified.  These genes are known to be important in several retinal developmental and physiologic pathways. Genes with known mutations are GUCY2D, RPE65, SPATA7, AIPL1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CRX, CRB1, NMNAT1, CEP290, IMPDH1, RD3, RDH12, LRAT, TULP1, KCNJ13, GDF6, CABP4, CNGA3, ALMS1, IQCB1, MYO7A. The other genes causing LCA are unknown. CEP290 (15%), GUCY2D (12%), and CRB1 (10%) and RPE65 (8%) are the most frequently mutated LCA genes.\nHistory", "German ophthalmologist, Theodor Leber, first described the dystrophy in 1869 in a blind child with wandering nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and congenital retinitis pigmentosa. In 1957, a non-recordable ERG (electroretinogram) was identified as a common feature essential to diagnosis of LCA. It was at this time that the disease was named. At the same time, a Swedish study identified the disease to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. This dystrophy is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disease affecting 1 in 30000 to 1 in 81000 subjects.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors are affected parent and/or parents who are carriers of a mutated gene responsible for one of the 17 LCA subtypes.\nGeneral Pathology\nThe histopathology showed the involvement of outer retina and photoreceptors and suggested that the LCA is a degenerative process rather than agenesis.\nPathophysiology", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "The estimated birth prevalence of LCA is two to three per 100,000 births. LCA represents almost 5% of all retinal dystrophies and 20% of children with visual impairment in special schools.\nDiagnosis\nHistory\nLCA is characterized by significant vision loss in infancy. It may be suspected in a young child with decreased visual response, nystagmus, poorly reactive pupils, and an extinguished ERG. Family history is typically consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.\nDiagnosis is clinical in this disorder, requiring thorough clinical evaluation and ophthalmic history. Diagnosis is supported by ERG and OCT (optical coherence tomography). Precise diagnosis requires molecular gene testing. Gene testing such as DNA microarray, next generation sequencing, linkage analysis and homozygosity/autozygosity mapping are used to identify specific gene mutations in LCA.", "LCA is characterized by at least three findings: severe and early visual impairment, sluggish or absent pupillary responses, and severely subnormal or non-detectible ERG.\nNo retinal lesion is diagnostic of LCA or specific for a certain subtype. Infants usually have normal fundus appearance and fundus abnormalities present later in life.\nSigns\n- Abnormal or absent pupillary response\n- Keratoconus\n- Nystagmus noticed early in life, present from birth, can be pendular or roving and is present in all positions of gaze\n- Photophobia\n- Nyctalopia\n- Vision loss (typically ranging from 20/200 to complete blindness)\n- Hyperopia is commonly found but myopia has also been reported. High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "- Non-ophthalmologic features include mental retardation and olfactory dysfunction, in addition to stereotypical movements and behaviors\nRetinal exam\n- The retina appears normal initially. Later, a variety of abnormalities may develop either in isolation or combination. They include: chorioretinal degeneration and atrophy centered around the fovea, \u201cbone-spicule\" like pigmentation, subretinal flecks, \"marbled\" fundus, pigmented nummular lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), optic disc abnormalities, and \u201cCoats like\u201d reaction.\n- Oculo-digital sign comprising eye poking, pressing, and rubbing likely producing mechanical retinal stimulation. The major sequel is enophthalmos, a physical defect in which the eye recedes into the orbit, presumably from atrophy of orbital fat. This behavior is performed to in an effort to stimulate vision.", "- Intellectual Disability: Rarely, LCA is seen in association with neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and oculomotor apraxia-type behavior.\nSymptoms\nVisual impairment\nProfound visual impairment is usually present from birth. One-third of individuals with LCA have no perception of light. Visual acuity is, with rare exceptions, 20/400 and below. The visual impairment is generally stable or very slowly progressive. Occasionally in the early stages, a mild degree of visual improvement is observed, followed by progressive degradation. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings and ERG. LCA has retinal, ocular, and extraocular features and occasionally, systemic associations. Recent evidence shows that not the genetics of LCA but the low vision can increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder. \nDiagnostic procedures", "- ERG: Nonrecordable/Extinguished or severely reduced scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) is typical in LCA. Normal ERG responses rule out a diagnosis of LCA. Visual evoked responses are variable. ERG measures electrical response of retina which are decreased or absent in LCA.\n- Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF): Autofluorescence measures lipofuscin accumulation in RPE which is related to shed photoreceptor disc elements. Amount of autofluorescence in LCA varies by subtype. For example, autofluorescence is normal in GUCY2D mutation but absent in RPE65 mutations. Abnormalities on FAF include a ring of macular hypo/hyper AF or peripheral hypo-AF. \n- OCT: OCT is high resolution cross sectional images of retinal architecture. In LCA, retinal atrophy is common. In advanced LCA, retinal arterioles are attenuated reflecting overall metabolic status of the retina.\nLaboratory test\n- Genetic testing is available for various genes.\nDifferential diagnosis", "- Senior-Loken syndrome (Juvenile nephronophthisis with LCA):\n- Juvenile nephronophthisis (medullary cystic renal disease)\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy\n- Conorenal syndrome (Renal dysplasia, retinal pigmentary dystrophy, cerebellar ataxia, and skeletal dysplasia or Short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly; SRTD9): Cone-shaped digital epiphyses\n- Joubert syndrome:\n- Nephronophthisis (a juvenile-onset cystic kidney disease)\n- Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy, and\n- Either or both of the following: Episodic hyperpnea and/or apnea\n- Peroxisome biogenesis disorders: A spectrum three phenotypes described before the biochemical and molecular basis of the disorders were known:\n- Zellweger syndrome (ZS) - Features include retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay with hypotonia, and liver dysfunction.

However, it is likely that development of keratoconus is due to a combination of genetic environmental and toxic (retinal death) factors.\nCataracts are also a known association of LCA. Etiology is similarly unclear but also likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental and toxic factors.\nManagement", "To date no substantial treatment or cure for LCA exists for most forms (see medical therapy section below). Affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error, use of low-vision aids when possible, and optimal access to educational and work-related opportunities.\nThere are several clinical trials, in different phases, involving specific mutation treatment  by gene replacement therapy or photo pigment supplementation.\nMedical therapy\nIn 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Philadelphia, PA), for the treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated- LCA2. This was the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved gene therapy product for the eye. RPE65 mutation accounts for only a minority of patients with LCA. For the other mutations there is no effective therapy proven so far. However, reduction in light exposure is recommended to avoid photophobia.\nGene Therapy", "The general theory behind gene therapy is that in a person with a known mutations of a coding region of a single gene, introduction of a normal allele can return cells to normal functioning. Gene therapy was first attempted in the Briard dog who was discovered to have similar clinical characteristics to humans of disease resulting from RPE65 gene mutation. In fact, there are a number of gene mutations in the RPE65 gene that are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies in both humans and dogs. The Briard dog was famously the first successful retinal gene therapy performed in animal models. Multiple studies have reported the restoration of vision in Briard dogs with RPE65 mutation using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors as effective gene delivery vehicles for treatment of retinal diseases. These breakthroughs served as the basis for clinical trials of gene therapy in humans.", "The FDA approval of sequential and bilateral injection of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to treat visually impaired patients who carry an RPE65 mutation was based on 1-year data from the only randomized controlled phase III clinical study to date, which demonstrated significant vision improvement as a result of the treatment.  Patients with LCA2, a mutation of RPE65 gene were treated with injection of adenovirus vector carrying a normal copy of the RPE65 gene. Multiyear follow-up evaluation of the patients from two other trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00481546 and NCT00643747), however, revealed progressive decline of clinical benefits including retinal sensitivity, visual acuity, and functional gain following an initial peak seen at 6\u2013 12 months after the treatment.", "Many additional gene therapy programs targeting both inherited retinal diseases and other ocular diseases are underway with animal models including treatment for GUCY2D, AIPL1 and CEP290 mutations found in other LCA subtypes. These studies are also using viral vectors to deliver normal genes and are showing promise in the rescue of rod-cone photoreceptors.\nMedical follow up", "Close follow-up of infants with LCA is recommended with diagnostic ERG. Fundus photos and detailed retinal examination may be helpful. Low vision referral may be warranted. Genetic counseling is recommended for families and patients. At conception, each sibling of an individual with recessively inherited LCA has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family are known. Pre-implantation genetics may be considered in this patient population.\nSurgery\nGene therapy is a technique where the genes are delivered through vector virus injected subretinally.\nPrognosis", "The disease has three subtypes: stable, progressive decline and appreciable improvement. Three separate studies with a total of 90 patients with LCA documented the prevalence of patients in each category.

Faulty genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease. Or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could stop the disease.\n- Replace genes that don't work properly. Some cells become diseased because certain genes don't work properly or no longer work at all. Replacing these genes with healthy genes may help treat certain diseases. For example, a gene called p53 usually prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If healthcare professionals could replace the faulty p53 gene, the healthy gene might cause the cancer cells to die.", "- Make the immune system aware of diseased cells. In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't see them as intruders.

A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually is delivered using a carrier called a vector.\nThe most common gene therapy vectors are viruses. That's because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the genes of those cells. Researchers change the viruses, replacing genes that cause disease with genes needed to stop disease.\nThis technique presents risks, including:\n- Unwanted immune system reaction. Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders. As a result, it may attack them. This may cause a reaction that ranges from swelling to organ failure.", "- Targeting the wrong cells. Viruses can affect more than one type of cell. So it's possible that the changed viruses may get into cells beyond those that aren't working properly. The risk of damage to healthy cells depends on which type of gene therapy is used and what it's used for.\n- Infection caused by the virus. It's possible that once the viruses get into the body, they may once again be able to cause disease.\n- Possibility of causing errors in your genes. These errors can lead to cancer.\nViruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry changed genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n- Stem cells. All cells in your body are created from stem cells.

Mutations in RPE65 (LCA2), Lebercilin (LCA5), RPGRIP1 (LCA6), CEP290 (LCA10), and TULP1 (LCA15) have been associated with this phenotype.1", "Type 4: Severe macular atrophy or foveal maldevelopment: This OCT pattern is associated with LCA mutations displaying severe maculopathies, namely AIPL1 (LCA4), NMNAT1 (LCA9) and RDH12 (LCA13). Note that the colobomatous-like maculopathy seen with NMNAT1 (LCA9) mutations is possibly due to a congenital lack of foveal formation and inner retinal layers. All 3 mutations show a reduced central ONL. The parafoveal retinal thickness varies in AIPL1 (LCA4) and RDH12 (LCA13) patients but is significantly thinned in NMNAT1 (LCA9).1\nLCA classification based on retinal histopathology findings", "There are 3 distinct categories that have been described2 based on \u201cpre-molecular testing\u201d histological studies of LCA eyes from cadavers or blind painful enucleated eyes. In type 1, there is an abnormal embryological formation of photoreceptors corresponding to an aplastic process. Type 2 is characterized by a degeneration process in which there is early and progressive photoreceptor loss. In type 3, there is retinal dysfunction due to absence or dysfunction of key retinal biochemical messages despite relatively normal architecture. Not surprisingly, these 3 histological categories correlate well with the OCT-based classification. Specifically, type 1 may be represented by CRB1 mutations; type 2 may correlate well with RPGRIP1, LCA5, and RPE65 mutations; and type 3 may correlate with GUCY2D mutations.\nTherapeutic Considerations", "As in all other retinal dystrophies, the visual deterioration in LCA cannot be prevented and/or halted yet, although several very exciting and novel treatments are showing great promise in human clinical trials, including gene augmentation, oral drug therapy, and intraocular drugs. Early and precise clinical and molecular genetic diagnosis is the first step in the appropriate management of this group of diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach by ophthalmologists, ocular geneticists, and counselors, as well as retinal dystrophy support groups is the best means to efficiently frame this disease in its numerous facets, and assist patients with vocational, educational, and family planning. Monitoring and treating possible clinical associations, such as renal failure and hearing loss, is primordial to maximize patients\u2019 quality of life.", "There have been significant advances in therapeutic modalities, including gene replacement, stem cell therapy, and pharmacologic therapies in a number of inherited retinal diseases. Gene replacement therapy using subretinal injection of genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown very promising results in several LCA animal models and humans: GUCY2D RetGC1 mouse models,111-113 RPE65 Briard dogs,114 and mouse models20,115-118 as well as AIPL1 knock-out mouse models,119 AAV-based gene replacement was shown to preserve and rescue photoreceptors (both rods and cones) and improve and restore retinal function. Based on this success, human clinical trials for LCA patients were undertaken globally and are at various stages of completion (Table 2).", "Presently, 3 phase I, 3 phase I/II and 1 phase III clinical trials in humans are being undertaken for RPE65-related patients using subretinal AAV gene replacement (Table 2). Furthermore, 2 phase I/II clinical trials have been completed. The data collected from these clinical investigations showed that AAV gene replacement is definitely safe but variably efficacious. Some studies have shown that the proposed treatment may not be sustainable, due to persistent progression of the retinal degeneration despite functional improvement in selected participants.121-124", "Oral substitutes of key components of the visual pathway have been clinically tested and have been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and adults with RPE65 and LRAT mutations.125,126 The 2 phases I/II clinical trials using a synthetic prodrug precursor to 9-cis-retinal, QLT091001, showed both significant enlargement of the kinetic visual field and improvement in visual acuity in 44% and 67% of participants, respectively.126 A phase III trial with the same agent is being planned.\nFinally, human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) therapy holds future promise as it aims to regenerate dysfunctional RPE cells. Currently, 2 human phase I/II stem cell clinical trials have demonstrated successful RPE integration of injected hESCs.127,128 The integration and transplantation of stem cells to the photoreceptor layer, which is needed for LCA therapy, is still in the preclinical stage.\nReferences", "- Coussa RG, Lopez Solache I, Koenekoop RK.

Patients usually present with nystagmus, sluggish or near-absent pupillary responses, severely decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and high hyperopia. It is the most severe retinal dystrophy causing blindness by the age of 1 year in most cases.", "The disease was first described by Theodor Karl Gustav von Leber (February 29, 1840 - April 17, 1917) in 1869. It should not be confused with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy described by the same physician in 1871. Leber also described 'Leber miliary aneurysms' now thought to be a variant of Coats disease.\nPrimary Prevention\nGenetic testing before pregnancy or prenatal testing can identify patients at risk of passing this condition on to offspring.\nEtiology", "Leber congenital amaurosis is a a group of hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) retinal diseases. Various phenotypes (LCA1 to LCA19) with at least 29 genotypes have been identified that account for around 70-80% of cases, with thereby more genes yet to be identified.  These genes are known to be important in several retinal developmental and physiologic pathways. Genes with known mutations are GUCY2D, RPE65, SPATA7, AIPL1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, CRX, CRB1, NMNAT1, CEP290, IMPDH1, RD3, RDH12, LRAT, TULP1, KCNJ13, GDF6, CABP4, CNGA3, ALMS1, IQCB1, MYO7A. The other genes causing LCA are unknown. CEP290 (15%), GUCY2D (12%), and CRB1 (10%) and RPE65 (8%) are the most frequently mutated LCA genes.\nHistory", "German ophthalmologist, Theodor Leber, first described the dystrophy in 1869 in a blind child with wandering nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and congenital retinitis pigmentosa. In 1957, a non-recordable ERG (electroretinogram) was identified as a common feature essential to diagnosis of LCA. It was at this time that the disease was named. At the same time, a Swedish study identified the disease to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. This dystrophy is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disease affecting 1 in 30000 to 1 in 81000 subjects.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors are affected parent and/or parents who are carriers of a mutated gene responsible for one of the 17 LCA subtypes.\nGeneral Pathology\nThe histopathology showed the involvement of outer retina and photoreceptors and suggested that the LCA is a degenerative process rather than agenesis.\nPathophysiology", "The pathophysiology of LCA is related to the inability of the eye to undergo phototransduction due to a disruption of the Visual Cycle. The Visual Cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the neurosensory retina to metabolize dietary vitamin A into 11-cis retinal to generate photopigment. Without 11-cis retinal, the phototransduction cascade cannot be initialized; thus, visual neuronal signals are not propagated to the visual cortex. A dysfunctional mutation of any of the genes encoding for proteins that catalyze any of the series of enzymatic reactions to generate 11-cis retinal can block the Visual Cycle and lead to symptoms of LCA.\nThe link between the hindrance of innate vitamin A metabolism within the eye and photoreceptor degeneration remains unclear and is currently an active area of biomedical research.\nEpidemiology", "The estimated birth prevalence of LCA is two to three per 100,000 births. LCA represents almost 5% of all retinal dystrophies and 20% of children with visual impairment in special schools.\nDiagnosis\nHistory\nLCA is characterized by significant vision loss in infancy. It may be suspected in a young child with decreased visual response, nystagmus, poorly reactive pupils, and an extinguished ERG. Family history is typically consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.\nDiagnosis is clinical in this disorder, requiring thorough clinical evaluation and ophthalmic history. Diagnosis is supported by ERG and OCT (optical coherence tomography). Precise diagnosis requires molecular gene testing. Gene testing such as DNA microarray, next generation sequencing, linkage analysis and homozygosity/autozygosity mapping are used to identify specific gene mutations in LCA.", "LCA is characterized by at least three findings: severe and early visual impairment, sluggish or absent pupillary responses, and severely subnormal or non-detectible ERG.\nNo retinal lesion is diagnostic of LCA or specific for a certain subtype. Infants usually have normal fundus appearance and fundus abnormalities present later in life.\nSigns\n- Abnormal or absent pupillary response\n- Keratoconus\n- Nystagmus noticed early in life, present from birth, can be pendular or roving and is present in all positions of gaze\n- Photophobia\n- Nyctalopia\n- Vision loss (typically ranging from 20/200 to complete blindness)\n- Hyperopia is commonly found but myopia has also been reported. High hyperopia (>5 diopters), which is thought to result from impaired emmetropization (the ability of the eye to accommodate to visual stimuli) is a consequence of early-onset visual impairment.", "- Non-ophthalmologic features include mental retardation and olfactory dysfunction, in addition to stereotypical movements and behaviors\nRetinal exam\n- The retina appears normal initially. Later, a variety of abnormalities may develop either in isolation or combination. They include: chorioretinal degeneration and atrophy centered around the fovea, \u201cbone-spicule\" like pigmentation, subretinal flecks, \"marbled\" fundus, pigmented nummular lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), optic disc abnormalities, and \u201cCoats like\u201d reaction.\n- Oculo-digital sign comprising eye poking, pressing, and rubbing likely producing mechanical retinal stimulation. The major sequel is enophthalmos, a physical defect in which the eye recedes into the orbit, presumably from atrophy of orbital fat. This behavior is performed to in an effort to stimulate vision.", "- Intellectual Disability: Rarely, LCA is seen in association with neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and oculomotor apraxia-type behavior.\nSymptoms\nVisual impairment\nProfound visual impairment is usually present from birth. One-third of individuals with LCA have no perception of light. Visual acuity is, with rare exceptions, 20/400 and below. The visual impairment is generally stable or very slowly progressive. Occasionally in the early stages, a mild degree of visual improvement is observed, followed by progressive degradation. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings and ERG. LCA has retinal, ocular, and extraocular features and occasionally, systemic associations. Recent evidence shows that not the genetics of LCA but the low vision can increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder. \nDiagnostic procedures", "- ERG: Nonrecordable/Extinguished or severely reduced scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) is typical in LCA. Normal ERG responses rule out a diagnosis of LCA. Visual evoked responses are variable. ERG measures electrical response of retina which are decreased or absent in LCA.\n- Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF): Autofluorescence measures lipofuscin accumulation in RPE which is related to shed photoreceptor disc elements. Amount of autofluorescence in LCA varies by subtype. For example, autofluorescence is normal in GUCY2D mutation but absent in RPE65 mutations. Abnormalities on FAF include a ring of macular hypo/hyper AF or peripheral hypo-AF. \n- OCT: OCT is high resolution cross sectional images of retinal architecture. In LCA, retinal atrophy is common. In advanced LCA, retinal arterioles are attenuated reflecting overall metabolic status of the retina.\nLaboratory test\n- Genetic testing is available for various genes.\nDifferential diagnosis", "- Senior-Loken syndrome (Juvenile nephronophthisis with LCA):\n- Juvenile nephronophthisis (medullary cystic renal disease)\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy\n- Conorenal syndrome (Renal dysplasia, retinal pigmentary dystrophy, cerebellar ataxia, and skeletal dysplasia or Short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly; SRTD9): Cone-shaped digital epiphyses\n- Joubert syndrome:\n- Nephronophthisis (a juvenile-onset cystic kidney disease)\n- Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis\n- Early-onset retinal dystrophy, and\n- Either or both of the following: Episodic hyperpnea and/or apnea\n- Peroxisome biogenesis disorders: A spectrum three phenotypes described before the biochemical and molecular basis of the disorders were known:\n- Zellweger syndrome (ZS) - Features include retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay with hypotonia, and liver dysfunction. It is usually lethal during the first year of life.", "- Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) - Retinal degeneration is associated with congenital liver and renal abnormalities.\n- Infantile Refsum disease (IRD)\n- Infantile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (CLN1, Santavuori-Haltia disease)\n- Normal at birth\n- Develop retinal vision impairment, loss of milestones, and progressive microcephaly by age six to 12 months\n- Blindness by age two years, seizures and progressive mental deterioration\n- Death generally occurs between ages three and 11 years\n- Disorders of mitochondrial dysfunction\n- Ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, proximal myopathy and exercise intolerance, cardiomyopathy, sensorineural deafness, optic atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP)\n- Later age of onset\n- Better preservation of central visual acuity\n- No nystagmus.", "- ERG: in the early stages of RP, the photopic component of the ERG typically shows some degree of sparing, while in LCA both the photopic and scotopic ERG are profoundly abnormal\n- SECORD (severe early-childhood onset retinal dystrophy)\n- Achromatopsia\n- Photophobia\n- Specific ERG changes\n- Congenital stationary night-blindness\n- Myopia\n- Specific ERG pattern\n- Better visual acuity\n- Abetalipoproteinemia\n- Hyperthreoninemia\n- Congenital Rubella Syndrome\n- ERG is typically normal\nComplications\nKeratoconus is often associated with LCA and it has been postulated that the mechanism is possibly secondary to the oculodigital phenomenon. However, it is likely that development of keratoconus is due to a combination of genetic environmental and toxic (retinal death) factors.\nCataracts are also a known association of LCA. Etiology is similarly unclear but also likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental and toxic factors.\nManagement", "To date no substantial treatment or cure for LCA exists for most forms (see medical therapy section below). Affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error, use of low-vision aids when possible, and optimal access to educational and work-related opportunities.\nThere are several clinical trials, in different phases, involving specific mutation treatment  by gene replacement therapy or photo pigment supplementation.\nMedical therapy\nIn 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Philadelphia, PA), for the treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated- LCA2. This was the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved gene therapy product for the eye. RPE65 mutation accounts for only a minority of patients with LCA. For the other mutations there is no effective therapy proven so far. However, reduction in light exposure is recommended to avoid photophobia.\nGene Therapy", "The general theory behind gene therapy is that in a person with a known mutations of a coding region of a single gene, introduction of a normal allele can return cells to normal functioning. Gene therapy was first attempted in the Briard dog who was discovered to have similar clinical characteristics to humans of disease resulting from RPE65 gene mutation. In fact, there are a number of gene mutations in the RPE65 gene that are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies in both humans and dogs. The Briard dog was famously the first successful retinal gene therapy performed in animal models. Multiple studies have reported the restoration of vision in Briard dogs with RPE65 mutation using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors as effective gene delivery vehicles for treatment of retinal diseases. These breakthroughs served as the basis for clinical trials of gene therapy in humans.", "The FDA approval of sequential and bilateral injection of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to treat visually impaired patients who carry an RPE65 mutation was based on 1-year data from the only randomized controlled phase III clinical study to date, which demonstrated significant vision improvement as a result of the treatment.  Patients with LCA2, a mutation of RPE65 gene were treated with injection of adenovirus vector carrying a normal copy of the RPE65 gene. Multiyear follow-up evaluation of the patients from two other trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00481546 and NCT00643747), however, revealed progressive decline of clinical benefits including retinal sensitivity, visual acuity, and functional gain following an initial peak seen at 6\u2013 12 months after the treatment.", "Many additional gene therapy programs targeting both inherited retinal diseases and other ocular diseases are underway with animal models including treatment for GUCY2D, AIPL1 and CEP290 mutations found in other LCA subtypes. These studies are also using viral vectors to deliver normal genes and are showing promise in the rescue of rod-cone photoreceptors.\nMedical follow up", "Close follow-up of infants with LCA is recommended with diagnostic ERG. Fundus photos and detailed retinal examination may be helpful. Low vision referral may be warranted. Genetic counseling is recommended for families and patients. At conception, each sibling of an individual with recessively inherited LCA has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family are known. Pre-implantation genetics may be considered in this patient population.\nSurgery\nGene therapy is a technique where the genes are delivered through vector virus injected subretinally.\nPrognosis", "The disease has three subtypes: stable, progressive decline and appreciable improvement. Three separate studies with a total of 90 patients with LCA documented the prevalence of patients in each category. In summary, 15%, 75%, and 10% of cases have showed deterioration, stability and improvement, respectively. The category to which patients belonged was dependent on the subtype of LCA each patient had.\nReferences\n- \u2191 American Academy of Ophthalmology.
