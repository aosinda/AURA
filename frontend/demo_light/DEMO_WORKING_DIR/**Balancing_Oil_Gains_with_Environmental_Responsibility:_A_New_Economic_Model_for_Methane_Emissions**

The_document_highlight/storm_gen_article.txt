# Background on Methane Emissions

Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that is emitted during the production and transport of oil, natural gas, and coal. It also results from agriculture and livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills. In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States, a notable concern given that methane is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) [1]. Methane's high global-warming potential—84 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period—makes it a critical target for climate change mitigation efforts [2].
Globally, methane emissions have surged in the past 15 years, with human activities playing a significant role. Approximately two-thirds of global methane emissions originate from human activities, including oil and gas operations, coal mining, landfills, livestock, and rice paddies [3]. This dramatic increase has led the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to officially list methane as a climate change priority to address this decade [1]. Notably, methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution [4].
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 10-20 years, compared to centuries for CO2, but it absorbs much more energy while it is in the atmosphere [5]. This short-lived climate pollutant can lead to ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant, and pose explosion hazards due to leaks [4]. Moreover, atmospheric concentrations of methane have more than doubled since pre-industrial times, making it second only to CO2 in driving climate change [6].
The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and quick reduction of these emissions is one of the most cost-effective actions the country can take to slow the rate of rising global temperatures [7]. Technologies to limit methane emissions are already available and have been successfully deployed in various parts of the world. Approximately 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, based on average energy prices in 2023 [8].
Reducing methane emissions not only helps mitigate climate change but also offers significant economic benefits. Captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. International cooperation and support could further enhance these efforts by addressing infrastructural and technological barriers in countries with high methane emissions, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq [1][2].

# Economic Models for Environmental Responsibility

Balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship is a complex but essential challenge for nations with high methane emissions. This is particularly evident in countries such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, where methane emissions are disproportionately high relative to their gas production. Effective methane management practices can yield substantial economic and environmental benefits, thereby contributing significantly to climate change mitigation efforts.

## Economic Benefits of Methane Management

One of the primary economic advantages of reducing methane emissions is the potential for cost savings. Captured methane can be utilized as a clean energy source, leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs. For instance, it is estimated that 40% of global methane emissions from fossil fuels can be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured gas outweighs the costs of abatement measures [8]. This zero-cost potential is even more pronounced in Iraq, where up to 64% of emissions could be eliminated at no additional cost [9].
The fossil fuel industry, which generated substantial income in 2023, is well-positioned to finance these abatement measures. The required spending represents less than 5% of the industry's income for that year, making it a feasible investment [8]. However, financial support from external sources is also crucial, especially for low- and middle-income countries where financing mechanisms may be limited.

## Ethical Considerations

Beyond the economic advantages, there is an ethical imperative to address methane emissions. Reducing these emissions contributes to limiting near-term temperature rise and improving air quality, which leads to better public health outcomes and food security [10]. This ethical dimension resonates with broader goals of sustainable development and corporate responsibility.

## Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

Implementing effective methane abatement measures requires robust regulatory frameworks and policy incentives. International support can play a significant role in helping countries overcome infrastructural and technological barriers to reducing emissions. For example, voluntary initiatives and coalitions, such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership and the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, are working towards lowering methane emissions by sharing best practices and setting emission targets [11]. However, these efforts need to be complemented by stringent government policies to ensure accountability and drive rapid reductions.

## Human Impact

The human angle is equally compelling. Improved air quality from reduced methane emissions can enhance the quality of life for local communities. In Iraq, for example, reducing methane emissions could alleviate chronic air pollution, leading to significant health benefits for the population [9]. This underscores the importance of integrating environmental responsibility into economic models to achieve both ecological and societal well-being.

# Global Methane Emissions Landscape

Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas emitted during the production and transport of oil, natural gas, and coal, as well as from agriculture, livestock practices, land use, and the decay of organic waste in landfills[1]. In 2021, methane accounted for 12 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the US, which is particularly alarming given its potency; methane is 25 percent more effective at trapping heat than CO2[1]. Moreover, methane is responsible for approximately 30 percent of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution[12].

## Recent Trends and Developments

In recent years, the understanding of methane emissions has grown significantly due to advances in monitoring technologies, notably from satellites[4]. Satellites can now detect and quantify methane emissions from major leaks over large areas down to smaller leaks at the facility level[4]. New satellite technologies like GHGSat, EnMAP, Carbon Mapper, and MethaneSAT promise to deliver higher-resolution images and more sensitive detection thresholds, improving methane quantification capabilities and supporting regulatory oversight[4]. For example, emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline explosion were among the first offshore leaks quantified using satellite data, with estimates ranging between 75,000 and 230,000 tonnes of methane[4].

## Economic and Environmental Implications

Addressing methane emissions is not only crucial for climate change mitigation but also has significant economic implications. Countries like Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq have excessively high methane emissions relative to their gas production, and managing these emissions could yield substantial reductions in global methane levels[13]. Improved methane management practices could result in economic savings from captured methane being used as a clean energy source, potentially boosting exports or reducing domestic energy costs[13].
Four of the ten largest oil and gas methane emitters, including the US, Canada, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia, have signed the Global Methane Pledge, targeting a 30 percent reduction in global emissions by the end of this decade from 2020 levels[13]. If methane generated from human activity is responsible for a larger share of the world's total emissions, including natural sources, achieving this target could have profound effects on mitigating climate change.

## Challenges and Solutions

Despite the potential benefits, significant challenges remain. Incomplete information about actual emissions levels and a lack of awareness of the cost-effectiveness of abatement are key barriers[4]. Moreover, infrastructural and technological barriers hinder many countries from effectively reducing methane emissions. International support, policy incentives, and technological advancements are essential to overcoming these barriers[4].

## Human and Ethical Considerations

Beyond economics, there is the ethical issue of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. Local communities affected by methane emissions often face health risks and reduced quality of life. Improved air quality resulting from better methane management could enhance their quality of life, providing an emotionally compelling narrative for sustainable development and corporate responsibility[4].

# Detailed Case Studies: Countries with High Methane Emissions

## Venezuela

Venezuela's methane emissions are alarmingly high, particularly in relation to its gas production. The country’s second-largest source of emissions, after the energy sector, is deforestation, primarily in the Amazon forest, one of the world’s critical carbon sinks[14]. Despite international concerns, Venezuela has not joined regional efforts led by Brazil and Colombia to curb deforestation and was notably absent from the COP 26 declaration on forests and land use[14]. Addressing these issues could yield significant reductions in methane emissions and provide economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source, potentially leading to increased exports or lower domestic energy costs.

## Turkmenistan

Turkmenistan is another country with disproportionately high methane emissions compared to its gas production. Analysis of TROPOMI satellite data reveals that oil and gas operations are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, highlighting the need for improved methane management practices[15]. Despite available cost-effective technologies that can substantially reduce these emissions, current infrastructural and technological barriers hinder progress[10]. International support in the form of technology transfer and financial incentives could play a crucial role in mitigating these emissions and aligning Turkmenistan’s economic strategies with global climate goals.

## Iraq

Iraq faces similar challenges, with high methane emissions relative to its gas production. Existing infrastructure and operational practices often result in substantial fugitive emissions from leaking equipment and deliberate flaring and venting[10]. Initiating comprehensive leak detection and repair programs, along with the adoption of better technologies, could significantly reduce these emissions. Moreover, policy incentives or penalties might alter Iraq's economic strategies, compelling it to adopt more sustainable practices[10]. International cooperation and funding could support these initiatives, potentially leading to substantial environmental and economic benefits.

## China

China is the highest emitter of methane in the coal sector and is also among the top five global emitters of methane from all sources[8][16]. Despite the high emissions, China has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, which further complicates global efforts to reduce methane levels[16]. Adopting tried and tested abatement policies could cut emissions significantly, presenting an opportunity for China to balance its economic growth with environmental responsibility[16]. Improved methane management could also lead to better air quality and enhanced public health, adding a compelling human dimension to the narrative.

## Russia

Russia follows closely behind the United States as the second-largest emitter of methane from oil and gas operations[8]. The country faces significant methane emissions from its extensive oil and gas infrastructure, which includes a vast network of aging pipelines and equipment prone to leaks[10]. Adopting comprehensive measurement and reporting requirements, similar to those implemented in Norway and the Netherlands, could help Russia reduce its methane emissions[16]. International support in the form of technology and expertise sharing could facilitate these efforts, potentially leading to significant environmental and economic gains.

## India

India is one of the top five global methane emitters, with significant contributions from both agriculture and energy sectors[16]. Despite the high emissions, India has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, highlighting a gap in global climate efforts[16]. Implementing abatement technologies and improving methane management practices could help India reduce its emissions, providing economic benefits through the utilization of captured methane as a clean energy source[10]. Enhanced air quality from reduced emissions would also benefit local communities, improving public health and quality of life.

# Overcoming Challenges in Methane Emission Reduction

Reducing methane emissions, particularly in the oil and gas sector, presents several challenges that need to be addressed through technological, economic, and policy measures. Tackling these challenges is crucial for achieving substantial climate benefits and aligning global energy practices with a 1.5˚C warming trajectory.

## Technological Barriers and Solutions

The detection and accurate measurement of methane emissions have historically been major obstacles in effective methane management. However, recent advancements in technology have significantly improved the accuracy of leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs. Modern approaches now incorporate a combination of satellites, aerial surveillance, and ground-based teams equipped with handheld devices, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for identifying and quantifying emissions [17]. Despite these advancements, the deployment of such technologies often requires substantial initial investments and continuous updates to stay effective [7].

## Economic Considerations

One of the most pragmatic and cost-effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is methane abatement in the fossil fuel industry. Approximately 40% of the 120 Mt of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost, as the market value of the captured methane gas often exceeds the required outlays for abatement measures [8]. For instance, investing in technologies to capture methane can lead to additional revenues from the sale of the captured gas. This economic benefit is more pronounced in the oil and natural gas sectors, where up to 50% of methane emissions can be reduced at no net cost [8].
Moreover, integrating advanced digital systems can streamline operations and reduce costs in the long run. Centralized systems, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms, reduce reliance on multiple software solutions and service providers, while predictive maintenance technologies can minimize expensive downtimes associated with equipment failures [18].

## Policy and Regulatory Support

Regulatory frameworks play a critical role in driving methane emission reductions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule in December 2023 to significantly reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations. This rule is part of a broader effort under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which includes measures to promote the adoption of advanced measurement technologies [7]. International support and policy incentives are essential for countries with high methane emissions, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan, and Iraq, to overcome infrastructural and technological barriers [18].

## Balancing Costs and Benefits

Implementing new technologies and innovations often comes with high initial costs, including investments in hardware, software, and employee training. However, these costs should be viewed as long-term investments rather than immediate expenses. Over time, the benefits of improved methane management—such as reduced emissions, better air quality, and potential economic gains from captured methane—can far outweigh the initial outlays [19]. Additionally, partnerships with technology companies and government support through benefit programs can help mitigate these costs and facilitate the adoption of innovative solutions [19].

# Advantages of Effective Methane Management

Effective management of methane emissions offers numerous advantages, spanning environmental, economic, and public health benefits.

## Economic Benefits

Addressing methane emissions can also result in considerable economic advantages. For instance, many mitigation measures are low-cost and provide significant economic benefits once initial investments are paid off[10]. The International Energy Agency estimates that around 75% of oil and gas methane emissions could be mitigated using existing technologies, with over half of these reductions achievable at zero net cost[10]. Additionally, deploying innovations to reduce methane emissions in agriculture and food systems could potentially reduce the cost of achieving climate targets by up to US$1 trillion by 2050[20].
Moreover, captured methane can be used as a clean energy source, enhancing energy security and potentially leading to increased exports or a reduction in domestic energy costs for countries[10]. This economic benefit aligns with the broader goal of transitioning to more sustainable and resilient energy systems.

## Environmental Benefits

Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential more than 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period[10][13]. Reducing methane emissions can, therefore, have a profound impact on slowing climate change. For example, the Global Methane Pledge aims for a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030, which could significantly mitigate climate change impacts[13].

## Public Health Benefits

Reducing methane emissions also brings substantial public health benefits. Methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is linked to severe health issues such as respiratory and cardiac illnesses[20]. It is estimated that ozone exposure results in approximately one million premature deaths annually[20]. A recent study found that for every megaton of methane emissions reduced, about 1,430 premature deaths are avoided each year, alongside numerous hospitalizations and emergency department visits[20]. Improved air quality from lower methane emissions can thus significantly enhance public health and quality of life.

## Broader System Benefits

Investing in methane reduction measures across sectors, including agriculture, energy, and waste, can provide extensive system-wide benefits. Innovations in methane management not only reduce emissions but also contribute to better land conservation, water preservation, and improved agricultural productivity[20]. These comprehensive benefits underscore the importance of integrating methane management into broader environmental and economic policies.

# Policy and International Initiatives

Policy and regulatory action to curb methane emissions remains uneven globally, although there has been notable progress in 2023. Several countries and regions have either adopted or proposed new regulations aimed at reducing methane emissions, aligning broadly with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario).
In December 2023, the United States finalized new regulations that impose stricter requirements on new and modified oil and gas facilities. These regulations also provide guidelines for states to regulate existing sources. A significant feature of the new rule is the establishment of the Super Emitter Program, which allows the government to act on emissions events detected remotely by qualified third parties, such as the International Methane Emissions Observatory’s Methane Alert and Response System. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this rule will cut emissions by nearly 80% from 2024 to 2038[11].
The European Union's external energy engagement strategy aims to provide technical assistance to partner countries for deploying methane abatement technologies. This strategy includes a "You Collect, We Buy" scheme, which the EU announced it would pilot with Algeria. Additionally, Japan and South Korea introduced the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement toward Net-zero (CLEAN) project. Under this initiative, large LNG purchasers will gather information from suppliers regarding methane reduction efforts to increase transparency about LNG-related emissions[11].
However, turning these ambitions into action will require active coordination and cooperation. There are numerous international methane initiatives designed to support increased action, with more emerging annually. The IEA is involved in many of these efforts, which serve as platforms for collaboration and knowledge sharing[16].
The United States and Canada have implemented effective approaches, although there remains room for improvement. Norway and the Netherlands are leading by example with comprehensive regimes that include robust measurement and reporting requirements, best industry practices, and economic incentives for methane abatement. Actions under the EU Methane Strategy are expected to extend these efforts across Europe[16].
Despite these advancements, some significant players like China, India, and the Russian Federation have not yet joined these global initiatives. Engaging with these countries is critical to achieving the overall target of reducing global methane emissions. For instance, in the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration, China committed to developing a comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane to achieve substantial emission reductions in the 2020s[21].
The priority is to implement practical solutions that can be executed at relatively low or net-negative costs. Where costs are prohibitive, coordinated action is necessary to create the infrastructure and fiscal conditions to support further initiatives. Enhanced monitoring, reporting, and verification, along with greater consumer choice and funding for technical solutions, are essential. Without these efforts, current initiatives may fail, jeopardizing global climate goals and leading to a precarious future[5].
