Do you agree with its principles?", "The social learning theory may explain helplessness as a coping mechanism. It means that you were shown through difficult circumstances that, no matter what you do, you can\u2019t get out of your situation.\nLater, even if circumstances have changed, those feelings may be hard to shake.\nInternalized stigma\nSome 2021 research suggests that social learning theory may explain why some people live with internalized stigma about having a mental health condition, which can make symptoms worse.\nFirst, you observe prejudice, bias, or discrimination from the public. Then, you internalize these negative ideas about yourself. As a result, you may experience reduced self-esteem and feel less optimistic about your ability to manage your condition.\nSubstance use disorder\nResearch from 2021 suggests that a combination of internal factors (like genetics) and environmental factors (like peer pressure and modeling) can impact how likely someone is to use substances.", "Modeling begins at an early age. Most children observe their primary caregivers and attempt to imitate some of their behaviors. This process continues on throughout life in many different scenarios.\nHow does this happen? The theory of social learning says there are three ways:\n- Live model: watching a person carrying out a behavior in front of you\n- Symbolic model: seeing a TV or movie character demonstrating a behavior\n- Verbal instructional model: hearing about a behavior through a teacher or a friend, listening to a podcast, reading about it in a book, or having a TikTok influencer explain it to you\nResearch from 2019 suggests that the rise of social media and \u201cfitspiration\u201d models have added a new dimension to social learning and modeling behaviors.\nPositive vs. negative reinforcement\nPositive reinforcement is a pleasant consequence of an action you take, which strengthens your desire to perform that behavior again.", "In sum, the three main principles of social learning theory state that:\n- You learn behaviors through observation.\n- Your mental state plays a role in this learning process, including whether or not you\u2019re motivated to engage in those behaviors.\n- Observing a behavior in someone else may not lead to a change in your behavior, unless there\u2019s some kind of positive reinforcement or reward.\nThe idea of social learning was introduced by Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura in the 1960s through the Bobo doll experiment. This is one of the most famous series of experiments in the world of psychology.\nIn a 1961 study, Bandura took Bobo dolls (life-size inflatable clowns) and instructed adults to act aggressively toward them in front of preschool-age children. The goal was to see what the children would do after observing these behaviors.\nThe adults hit the Bobo doll with a mallet, threw the doll into the air, kicked it, then punched it on the ground.", "Indeed, research has suggested that some mental health conditions have a strong social learning component. These include:\nAnxiety\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, you have an advantage if you can pick up on the fear of those around you because that gives you have ample time to respond to danger.\nIf you watch other people anticipate danger, you may learn to do so, too. If the threat is not clear, however, you may learn that always being on alert is an effective way of anticipating danger.\nConduct disorder\nSocial learning theory is best known for explaining how children who witness violence may later become violent themselves. This is a core feature of conduct disorder.\nA\nThat same study found that these children were more likely to present symptoms of:\n- anxiety\n- depression\n- social withdrawal\n- somatic complaints\nDepression", "In one study published in 2020, for example, cadets in Turkey who watched their fathers or peers smoke cigarettes were more likely to smoke cigarettes themselves.\nAnother 2018 study in New Zealand found that students who limited their alcohol intake were stigmatized, ostracized, and subjected to peer pressure to drink more.\nSocial learning theory is about explaining human behavior as a result of observing and copying other people\u2019s actions and reactions.\nThe theory aims to explain that most of our behaviors \u2014 and some mental health conditions \u2014 have a strong social learning component. In other words, they come from having watched someone else do the same things.\nIf you\u2019ve had positive reinforcement or rewards from engaging in those behaviors, you\u2019re also more likely to repeat them.\nWhile many mental health conditions may also be explained by biology and genetics, some symptoms seem to connect to what a person has learned from their environment.", "For example, if you\u2019re in a better mood after you go on a walk, you may feel more motivated to exercise again.\nNegative reinforcement is the opposite; it\u2019s a negative consequence that happens after you engage in a certain behavior.\nFor example, if you feel drained every time you hang out with a certain family member, you may feel less motivated to spend time with them.\nBefore Bandura released his theory, psychologists mostly used a concept called behaviorism to explain how people pick up new information and engage in new behaviors.\nAccording to 2018 research, behaviorism states that learning comes from interacting with your environment and being conditioned through positive or negative reinforcement.

Pinel believed that \u201cmentally ill patients would improve if they were treated with kindness and consideration\u201d instead of filthy, noisy, and abusive environments; he implemented his hypothesis when he took over La Bicetre.\nAnother major reformist, William Tuke, founded the York Retreat where patients were treated with \u201crespect and compassion\u201d (Foerschner).

Meyers wanted to move the mental hygiene movement, then focused on programs of intervention in social problems, to accept the necessity of basing its proposals on scientific research. He proposed a program of research based on the belief that the causes of mental illnesses were rooted in the interaction between biology and life history events. Meyers began a biographical or \"life story\" approach to studying mentally ill patients to provide a scientific knowledge base for mental hygiene efforts (Dreyer 1976).", "At a meeting of the nation's public health officers in 1948, and later as part of the committee charged with designing the new National Institute of Mental Health after passage of the National Mental Health Act, Lemkau was able to promote the idea that mental hygiene and public health belonged together. This concept was expressed in his 1949 book, Mental Hygiene and Public Health. In 1949 the Maryland State Health Department invited Lemkau to be the director of a new Division of Mental Health. Four years of experience in that position convinced him that, while the mental hygiene clinics must continue to promote activities preventing psychogenic mental illness, other agencies charged with combating extreme poverty and providing public education would reach larger segments of the population", ". Working with the faculty teaching public health practice to future health commissioners, he became convinced that the expanding public health system would provide the institutional opportunity to bring mental hygiene to the population. As he envisioned it, mental health practitioners in public health would use the tools of epidemiology and biostatistics to diagnose the mental health needs of the population while mental health education could produce effects analogous to immunization for mental disorders.", "The mental hygiene movement, as it was called, was criticized in some medical circles for its lack of an objective scientific basis for its proposals and its \"unscientific\" focus on sociological factors as being the key to the prevention of mental illness and preservation of health. The mental hygiene movement was torn by differences between psychiatrists devoted to treating the mentally ill through biological means and mental hygienists attempting to promote mental health by changing societal institutions.", ". Since these agencies were not staffed by mental health personnel, mental health personnel would have to influence these farther-reaching agencies by means of epidemiologic studies that would convince them to establish policies and programs promoting mental health. He observed that professionals operating psychiatric clinics within local health departments tended to isolate themselves from other personnel, continuing to deliver traditional outpatient psychiatric services (Mental Hygiene and Public Health, 1955 edition). He saw the need for specially trained mental health professional personnel who would work from the public health department as a base. He called for experimentation in expanding mental health professionals' roles to include education and consultation to health and other agency personnel", ". He was aware that voluntary groups want more rapid program development than public agencies, but maintained that these sometimes stressful differences between official and non-government organizations were to the general benefit of society.", ". By World War II, the mental hygiene movement had expanded to the ideas that 1) maladjustments that are not psychiatric but that bring the child into conflict with the law are of concern to mental health; 2) even slight deviations from harmony with the environment in the social world of the school and nursery are close to the roots of ultimate difficulties that produce mental disorder; 3) institutional programs should be encouraged that are favorable to the creation of a mentally healthy environment; 4) community forces should be coordinated to supply mentally health environments; and 5) mental health principles should be integrated into the practices of social work, nursing, public health administration, education, industry and government."], "title": "Origins of Mental Health - Johns Hopkins"}, "https://neurosciencenews.com/trauma-brain-changes-24944/": {"url": "https://neurosciencenews.com/trauma-brain-changes-24944/", "description": "Summary: Unveiling the neurological enigma of traumatic memory formation, researchers harnessed innovative optical and machine-learning methodologies to decode the brain\u2019s neuronal networks engaged during trauma memory creation.

Delivered as a nasal spray in a doctor\u2019s office, clinic, or hospital, it acts rapidly, typically within a couple of hours, to relieve depression symptoms. People who use esketamine will usually continue taking an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in their symptoms.\nAnother option for treatment-resistant depression is to take an antidepressant alongside a different type of medication that may make it more effective, such as an antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication. Further research is needed to identify the role of these newer medications in routine practice.", "Several types of psychotherapy (also called talk therapy or counseling) can help people with depression by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and helping them change habits that contribute to depression.

The other therapies are newer and, in some cases, still considered experimental. Other brain stimulation therapies may also hold promise for treating specific mental disorders.\nECT, rTMS, and VNS have authorization from the FDA to treat severe, treatment-resistant depression. They can be effective for people who have not been able to feel better with other treatments; people for whom medications cannot be used safely; and in severe cases where a rapid response is needed, such as when a person is catatonic, suicidal, or malnourished.\nAdditional types of brain stimulation therapy are being investigated for treating depression and other mental disorders. Talk to a health care provider and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks before undergoing brain stimulation therapy.
