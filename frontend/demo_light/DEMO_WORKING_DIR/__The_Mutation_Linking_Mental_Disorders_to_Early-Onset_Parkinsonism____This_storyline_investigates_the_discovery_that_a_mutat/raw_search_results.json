In addition to Parkinson\u2019s disease, alterations in dopamine transporter density or function have been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and certain forms of dementia. The ability to visualize these changes in vivo provides valuable insights into the underlying neurobiology of these disorders and may help guide treatment decisions.\nHowever, dopamine transporter diagnostics face several challenges and limitations. The high cost and limited availability of PET and SPECT imaging facilities can restrict their widespread use. Additionally, the interpretation of imaging results requires specialized expertise, and there can be variability in results depending on the specific ligand and imaging protocol used. Despite these challenges, ongoing research continues to refine these techniques and expand their clinical applications.", "The study of dopamine transporters intersects with numerous other aspects of neurobiology, including the function of dopaminergic receptors and the broader dopamine signaling system. As we continue to piece together this complex puzzle, we move closer to a comprehensive understanding of how the brain\u2019s molecular traffic controllers shape our mental and physical experiences.\nThe journey of discovery in this field promises not only to expand our knowledge of brain function but also to open new avenues for improving human health and well-being. From enhancing cognitive performance to treating debilitating neurological conditions, the potential applications of dopamine transporter research are vast and exciting. As we look to the future, the molecular dance of dopamine transporters continues to captivate scientists and offer hope for those affected by disorders of the brain\u2019s reward and motor systems.\nReferences:", "Pharmacological Targeting of Dopamine Transporters\nA variety of medications target dopamine transporters to modulate dopamine signaling in the brain. These drugs can be broadly categorized into two groups: those that inhibit dopamine reuptake and those that enhance it. Dopamine reuptake inhibitors work by blocking the transporter\u2019s function, leading to increased dopamine levels in the synapse. Conversely, drugs that enhance dopamine reuptake can reduce excessive dopamine signaling.", "One of the most studied polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene is a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in the 3\u2032 untranslated region. This polymorphism exists in several forms, with the most common being 9-repeat and 10-repeat alleles. These genetic variations have been associated with differences in dopamine transporter expression and, consequently, dopamine signaling efficiency.\nThe impact of genetic variations on dopamine signaling can be profound. For instance, individuals carrying certain alleles may have higher or lower levels of dopamine transporter expression, leading to differences in dopamine clearance rates from the synapse. These variations can influence a wide range of behaviors and cognitive functions, including attention, impulsivity, and reward sensitivity.", "Dopamine transporters are specialized proteins embedded in the cell membranes of dopaminergic neurons. Their primary function is to remove excess dopamine from the synaptic cleft by rapidly shuttling it back into the presynaptic neuron. This process, known as reuptake, is vital for maintaining the delicate balance of dopamine in the brain. By regulating dopamine levels, these transporters help fine-tune neural signaling and ensure optimal brain function.\nDopamine cellular response is intricately linked to the activity of dopamine transporters. When dopamine is released into the synaptic cleft, it binds to dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a cascade of cellular events. The duration and intensity of this response are largely controlled by the efficiency of dopamine transporters in clearing excess dopamine from the synapse.\nStructure and Function of Dopamine Transporters", "Dopamine transporters play a central role in addiction and substance abuse. Many drugs of abuse, including cocaine and amphetamines, directly target these transporters. Cocaine, for example, binds to dopamine transporters and blocks their function, leading to an accumulation of dopamine in the synapse and producing intense feelings of euphoria. This mechanism underlies the addictive potential of such substances and highlights the critical role of dopamine transporters in addiction processes.", "From an evolutionary perspective, the diversity in dopamine transporter genetics may reflect adaptations to different environmental pressures. Variations in dopamine signaling could have conferred advantages in certain contexts, such as increased focus or risk-taking behavior. This genetic diversity might explain some of the individual differences we observe in personality traits and cognitive abilities.\nDopamine Transporters in Health and Disease\nDopamine transporters play a critical role in attention and cognitive function. By regulating the duration and intensity of dopamine signaling, they help modulate various cognitive processes, including working memory, decision-making, and attention allocation. Dopaminergic neurons, which rely on these transporters for proper function, are integral to these cognitive processes.", "The implications of dopamine transporters in reward and motivation are profound. The mesolimbic dopamine pathway, often referred to as the brain\u2019s reward circuit, heavily relies on proper dopamine transporter function. This system is crucial for reinforcing behaviors that are essential for survival and well-being. Dysregulation of dopamine transporters in this pathway can lead to alterations in reward processing and motivation, potentially contributing to conditions such as depression and anhedonia.", "The molecular structure of dopamine transporters is a marvel of biological engineering. These proteins belong to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family and consist of 12 transmembrane domains that span the neuronal membrane. The transporter forms a central pore through which dopamine molecules are shuttled across the membrane. This structure is highly specialized to recognize and bind dopamine molecules selectively, ensuring efficient reuptake.", "In conclusion, dopamine transporters stand as critical regulators of brain function, orchestrating the delicate balance of dopamine signaling that underlies our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. From their molecular structure to their role in health and disease, these proteins exemplify the intricate complexity of the human brain. Dopamine uptake, mediated by these transporters, is a fundamental process that shapes our neural landscape.\nAs research continues to unravel the mysteries of dopamine transporters, we stand on the brink of potential breakthroughs in understanding and treating a wide range of neurological disorders. Future directions in dopamine transporter research may include more precise genetic studies to understand individual variations, advanced imaging techniques for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, and the development of highly targeted therapeutics with fewer side effects.", "6.

Scientists are exploring more selective and potent dopamine transporter inhibitors that could offer improved efficacy and reduced side effects for conditions like ADHD and depression. Additionally, there is growing interest in developing drugs that can modulate dopamine transporter function in more nuanced ways, potentially offering new treatment options for a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to consider the risks and side effects associated with drugs that target dopamine transporters. These can include addiction potential, cardiovascular effects, and psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or mood changes. The balance between therapeutic benefit and potential risks must be carefully weighed in the development and prescription of these medications.", "Dopamine Transporter: The Brain\u2019s Molecular Traffic Controller\nZooming through neural highways at breakneck speeds, molecular traffic controllers orchestrate a delicate dance of chemical signals that shape our very thoughts and behaviors. These microscopic maestros, known as dopamine transporters, play a crucial role in regulating the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for various brain functions. Dopamine transporters act as the brain\u2019s molecular traffic controllers, carefully managing the flow of dopamine molecules in the synaptic cleft, the tiny gap between neurons where chemical communication occurs.", "Neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized our ability to study dopamine transporters in living brains. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two primary methods used to visualize and quantify dopamine transporter density and distribution. These techniques use radioactive ligands that bind specifically to dopamine transporters, allowing researchers and clinicians to map their presence and activity in different brain regions.\nThe clinical applications of dopamine transporter imaging are diverse and growing. In the field of neurology, these imaging techniques are particularly valuable for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson\u2019s disease. By assessing the density of dopamine transporters in the striatum, clinicians can differentiate Parkinson\u2019s disease from other movement disorders and track the progression of the disease over time.", "The distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain is not uniform but follows the pattern of dopaminergic pathways. They are most abundant in regions rich in dopaminergic neurons, such as the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex. This distribution pattern aligns with the critical roles of dopamine in motor control, reward processing, and executive functions. Dopamine\u2019s crucial role in movement is closely tied to the activity of these transporters in the motor regions of the brain.\nDopamine Transporter Genetics and Variations\nThe expression and function of dopamine transporters are influenced by a complex interplay of genetic factors. The gene encoding the dopamine transporter, known as SLC6A3 or DAT1, is located on chromosome 5 in humans. This gene contains several polymorphisms that can affect the expression levels and activity of the transporter protein.", "The mechanism of dopamine reuptake is a complex process that relies on the electrochemical gradient across the neuronal membrane. When a dopamine molecule binds to the transporter on the extracellular side, it triggers a conformational change in the protein. This change allows the dopamine molecule to be transported across the membrane and released into the intracellular space. The process is coupled with the co-transport of sodium and chloride ions, which provides the energy needed for this uphill transport of dopamine against its concentration gradient.\nDopamine transporters play a crucial role in maintaining dopamine homeostasis in the brain. By rapidly clearing excess dopamine from the synaptic cleft, they prevent overstimulation of dopamine receptors and ensure that signaling remains within physiological limits. This homeostatic function is essential for normal brain function, as both too little and too much dopamine can lead to various neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "The therapeutic applications of dopamine transporter-targeting drugs are particularly notable in the treatment of ADHD and depression. Stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, work primarily by inhibiting dopamine reuptake. This action increases dopamine signaling in key brain regions involved in attention and executive function. In depression, some antidepressants, particularly those in the class of norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), target dopamine transporters to enhance mood and motivation.", "The involvement of dopamine transporters in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson\u2019s disease, is an area of intense research. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to a decrease in dopamine levels and, consequently, a reduction in dopamine transporter density. This loss contributes to the motor symptoms characteristic of the disease, such as tremors and rigidity. Dopamine\u2019s role in motor control is significantly impaired in these conditions, highlighting the importance of maintaining proper dopamine transporter function.\nDopamine Transporter Imaging and Diagnostics"], "title": "Dopamine Transporter: Key to Brain Function - neurolaunch.com"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter", "description": "The dopamine transporter (DAT, also sodium-dependent dopamine transporter) is a membrane-spanning protein coded for in humans by the SLC6A3 gene (also known as DAT1), that pumps the neurotransmitter dopamine out of the synaptic cleft back into cytosol.In the cytosol, other transporters sequester the dopamine into vesicles for storage and later release. .

As a result of DAT\u2013Cav coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release.\nProtein structure", "In the substantia nigra, DAT is localized to axonal and dendritic (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes.\nWithin the perikarya of pars compacta neurons, DAT was localized primarily to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation.\nGenetics and regulation\n[edit]The gene for DAT, known as DAT1, is located on chromosome 5p15.

PMID 24953830.", "DAT is implicated in a number of dopamine-related disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, eating disorders, and substance use disorders. The gene that encodes the DAT protein is located on chromosome 5, consists of 15 coding exons, and is roughly 64 kbp long. Evidence for the associations between DAT and dopamine related disorders has come from a type of genetic polymorphism, known as a variable number tandem repeat, in the SLC6A3 gene, which influences the amount of protein expressed.\nFunction\n[edit]DAT is an integral membrane protein that removes dopamine from the synaptic cleft and deposits it into surrounding cells, thus terminating the signal of the neurotransmitter. Dopamine underlies several aspects of cognition, including reward, and DAT facilitates regulation of that signal.\nMechanism", "The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains an endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396). ... Although Zn2+ inhibited uptake, Zn2+ facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET).\n- ^ Scassellati C, Bonvicini C, Faraone SV, Gennarelli M (October 2012). \"Biomarkers and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analyses\".

PMID 23021477.\nWith regard to zinc supplementation, a placebo controlled trial reported that doses up to 30 mg/day of zinc were safe for at least 8 weeks, but the clinical effect was equivocal except for the finding of a 37% reduction in amphetamine optimal dose with 30 mg per day of zinc.110", "[edit]DAT is a symporter that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and co-transport of two Na+ ions and one Cl\u2212 ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase.\nIn the most widely accepted model for monoamine transporter function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane.", "AMPH also increases intracellular calcium (Gnegy et al., 2004) that is associated with calmodulin/CamKII activation (Wei et al., 2007) and modulation and trafficking of the DAT (Fog et al., 2006; Sakrikar et al., 2012).\n- ^ a b c Vaughan RA, Foster JD (September 2013). \"Mechanisms of dopamine transporter regulation in normal and disease states\".

These processes are PKC\u03b2\u2013 and CaMK\u2013dependent , and PKC\u03b2 knock-out mice display decreased AMPH-induced efflux that correlates with reduced AMPH-induced locomotion .", "The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. In contrast, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) do not contain zinc binding sites. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nBiological role and disorders\n[edit]The rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell. This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters. These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of ADHD.", "- ^ Cheng MH, Block E, Hu F, Cobanoglu MC, Sorkin A, Bahar I (2015). \"Insights into the Modulation of Dopamine Transporter Function by Amphetamine, Orphenadrine, and Cocaine Binding\".

In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine.

When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol.

Traditionally researchers built timelines of human prehistory based on fossils and artifacts, which can be directly dated with methods such as radiocarbon dating and Potassium-argon dating. However, these methods require ancient remains to have certain elements or preservation conditions, and that is not always the case. Moreover, relevant fossils or artifacts have not been discovered for all milestones in human evolution.", "Molecular clocks are based on two key biological processes that are the source of all heritable variation: mutation and recombination.\nMutations are changes to the letters of DNA\u2019s genetic code \u2013 for instance, a nucleotide Guanine (G) becomes a Thymine (T). These changes will be inherited by future generations if they occur in eggs, sperm or their cellular precursors (the germline). Most result from mistakes when DNA copies itself during cell division, although other types of mutations occur spontaneously or from exposure to hazards like radiation and chemicals.\nIn a single human genome, there are about 70 nucleotide changes per generation \u2013 minuscule in a genome made up of six billion letters. But in aggregate, over many generations, these changes lead to substantial evolutionary variation.", "At that time, a population \u2013 the common ancestors of both human groups \u2013 separated geographically and genetically. Some individuals of the group migrated to Eurasia and over time evolved into Neanderthals. Those who stayed in Africa became anatomically modern humans.\nHowever, their interactions were not over: Modern humans eventually spread to Eurasia and mated with Neanderthals. Applying the recombination clock to Neanderthal DNA retained in present-day humans, researchers estimate that the groups interbred between 54,000 and 40,000 years ago. When scientists analyzed a Homo sapiens fossil, known as Oase 1, who lived around 40,000 years ago, they found large regions of Neanderthal ancestry embedded in the Oase genome, suggesting that Oase had a Neanderthal ancestor just four to six generations ago. In other words, Oase\u2019s great-great-grandparent was a Neanderthal.\nThe challenges of unsteady clocks", "Focusing on CpG transitions, geneticists recently estimated the split between humans and chimps to have occurred between 9.3 and 6.5 million years ago, which agrees with the age expected from fossils. While in comparisons across species, these mutations seem to happen more like clockwork than other types, they are still not completely steady.\nAnother approach is to develop models that adjust molecular clock rates based on sex and other life history traits. Using this method, researchers calculated a chimp-human divergence consistent with the CpG estimate and fossil dates. The drawback here is that, when it comes to ancestral species, we can\u2019t be sure of life history traits, like age at puberty or generation length, leading to some uncertainty in the estimates.", "DNA holds the story of our ancestry \u2013 how we\u2019re related to the familiar faces at family reunions as well as more ancient affairs: how we\u2019re related to our closest nonhuman relatives, chimpanzees; how Homo sapiens mated with Neanderthals; and how people migrated out of Africa, adapting to new environments and lifestyles along the way. And our DNA also holds clues about the timing of these key events in human evolution.", "Because mutations accumulate so slowly, this clock works better for very ancient events, like evolutionary splits between species. The recombination clock, on the other hand, ticks at a rate appropriate for dates within the last 100,000 years. These \u201crecent\u201d events (in evolutionary time) include gene flow between distinct human populations, the rise of beneficial adaptations or the emergence of genetic diseases.\nThe case of Neanderthals illustrates how the mutation and recombination clocks can be used together to help us untangle complicated ancestral relationships. Geneticists estimate that there are 1.5-2 million mutational differences between Neanderthals and modern humans. Applying the mutation clock to this count suggests the groups initially split between 750,000 and 550,000 years ago.", "Another issue is that mutation rates vary by sex and age. As fathers get older, they transmit a couple extra mutations to their offspring per year. The sperm of older fathers has undergone more rounds of cell division, so more opportunities for mutations. Mothers, on the other hand, transmit fewer mutations (about 0.25 per year) as a female\u2019s eggs are mostly formed all at the same time, before her own birth. Mutation rates also depend on factors like onset of puberty, age at reproduction and rate of sperm production. These life history traits vary across living primates and probably also differed between extinct species of human ancestors.", "One issue relates to a gene called Prdm9, which determines the location of those DNA crossover events. Variation in this gene in humans, chimpanzees and mice has been shown to alter recombination hotspots \u2013 short regions of high recombination rates. Due to the evolution of Prdm9 and hotspots, the fine-scale recombination rates differ between humans and chimps, and possibly also between Africans and Europeans. This implies that over different timescales and across populations, the recombination clock ticks at slightly different rates as hotspots evolve.", "Scientists can use mutations to estimate the timing of branches in our evolutionary tree. First they compare the DNA sequences of two individuals or species, counting the neutral differences that don\u2019t alter one\u2019s chances of survival and reproduction. Then, knowing the rate of these changes, they can calculate the time needed to accumulate that many differences. This tells them how long it\u2019s been since the individuals shared ancestors.\nComparison of DNA between you and your sibling would show relatively few mutational differences because you share ancestors \u2013 mom and dad \u2013 just one generation ago. However, there are millions of differences between humans and chimpanzees; our last common ancestor lived over six million years ago.", "The most direct solution comes from analyses of ancient DNA recovered from fossils. Because the fossil specimens are independently dated by geologic methods, geneticists can use them to calibrate the molecular clocks for a given time period or population.\nThis strategy recently resolved the debate over the timing of our divergence with Neanderthals. In 2016, geneticists extracted ancient DNA from 430,000-year-old fossils that were Neanderthal ancestors, after their lineage split from Homo sapiens. Knowing where these fossils belong in the evolutionary tree, geneticists could confirm that for this period of human evolution, the slower molecular clock rate of 0.5x10\u207b\u2079 provides accurate dates. That puts the Neanderthal-modern human split between 765,000 to 550,000 years ago.\nAs geneticists sort out the intricacies of molecular clocks and sequence more genomes, we\u2019re poised to learn more than ever about human evolution, directly from our DNA.", "Molecular clocks are a mainstay of evolutionary calculations, not just for humans but for all forms of living organisms. But there are some complicating factors.\nThe main challenge arises from the fact that mutation and recombination rates have not remained constant over human evolution. The rates themselves are evolving, so they vary over time and may differ between species and even across human populations, albeit fairly slowly. It\u2019s like trying to measure time with a clock that ticks at different speeds under different conditions.", "Recombination, also known as crossing-over, is the other main way DNA accumulates changes over time. It leads to shuffling of the two copies of the genome (one from each parent), which are bundled into chromosomes. During recombination, the corresponding (homologous) chromosomes line up and exchange segments, so the genome you pass on to your children is a mosaic of your parents\u2019 DNA.\nIn humans, about 36 recombination events occur per generation, one or two per chromosome. As this happens every generation, segments inherited from a particular individual get broken into smaller and smaller chunks. Based on the size of these chunks and frequency of crossovers, geneticists can estimate how long ago that individual was your ancestor.\nBuilding timelines based on changes\nGenetic changes from mutation and recombination provide two distinct clocks, each suited for dating different evolutionary events and timescales.", "For the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans, the slower rate provides an estimate between 765,000-550,000 years ago. The faster rate, however, would suggest half that age, or 380,000-275,000 years ago: a big difference.\nTo resolve the question of which rates to use when and on whom, researchers have been developing new molecular clock methods, which address the challenges of evolving mutation and recombination rates.\nNew approaches for better dating\nOne approach is to focus on mutations that arise at a steady rate regardless of sex, age and species. This may be the case for a special type of mutation that geneticists call CpG transitions by which the C nucelotides spontaneously become T\u2019s. Because CpG transitions mostly do not result from DNA copying errors during cell division, their rates should be mainly independent of life history variables \u2013 and presumably more uniform over time.", "Consequently, over the course of human evolution, the average mutation rate seems to have slowed significantly. The average rate over millions of years since the split of humans and chimpanzees has been estimated as about 1x10\u207b\u2079 mutations per site per year \u2013 or roughly six altered DNA letters per year. This rate is determined by dividing the number of nucleotide differences between humans and other apes by the date of their evolutionary splits, as inferred from fossils. It\u2019s like calculating your driving speed by dividing distance traveled by time passed. But when geneticists directly measure nucleotide differences between living parents and children (using human pedigrees), the mutation rate is half the other estimate: about 0.5x10\u207b\u2079 per site per year, or only about three mutations per year.", "Analyzing DNA from present-day and ancient genomes provides a complementary approach for dating evolutionary events. Because certain genetic changes occur at a steady rate per generation, they provide an estimate of the time elapsed. These changes accrue like the ticks on a stopwatch, providing a \u201cmolecular clock.\u201d By comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can not only reconstruct relationships between different populations or species but also infer evolutionary history over deep timescales.\nMolecular clocks are becoming more sophisticated, thanks to improved DNA sequencing, analytical tools and a better understanding of the biological processes behind genetic changes. By applying these methods to the ever-growing database of DNA from diverse populations (both present-day and ancient), geneticists are helping to build a more refined timeline of human evolution.\nHow DNA accumulates changes"], "title": "DNA dating: How molecular clocks are refining human evolution\u2019s timeline"}, "https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-variants-of-concern-omicron": {"url": "https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-variants-of-concern-omicron", "description": "The web page explains the characteristics, contagiousness, severity, and vaccine effectiveness of Omicron and Delta, the two dominant variants in the U.S. in 2023.

In mid-October the AY.4.2 Delta sublineage was expanding in England, and being monitored and assessed. It contains mutations A222V and Y145H in its spike protein, not considered of particular concern. It has been suggested that AY.4.2 might be 10-15% more transmissible than the original Delta variant. Mid-October 2021, AY.4.2 accounted for an estimated 10% of cases, and has led to an additional growth rate rising to about 1% (10% of 10%) per generational time of five days or so. This additional growth rate would grow with increasing prevalence. Without AY.4.2 and no other changes, the number of cases in the UK would have been about 10% lower. AY.4.2 grows about 15% faster per week. In the UK it was reclassified as a \"variant under investigation\" (but not \"of concern\") in late October 2021.

For example, as of 18 May, Pakistan had not reported any cases, but authorities noted that 15% of COVID-19 samples in the country were of an \"unknown variant\"; they could not say if it was B.1.617 because they were unable to test for it. Other countries had reported travellers arriving from Pakistan that were infected with B.1.617.\nIn June 2021, scientist Vinod Scaria of India's Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology highlighted the existence of the B.1.617.2.1 variant, also known as AY.1 or Delta plus, which has an additional K417N mutation compared to the Delta variant.

Data strongly indicates that full vaccination against COVID-19 may slow down virus evolution.\nTreatment\nIn vitro experiments suggest that bamlanivimab may not be effective against Delta on its own. At high enough concentrations, casirivimab, etesevimab and imdevimab appear to still be effective. A preprint study suggests that sotrovimab may also be effective against Delta.

The top 5 CPS SNP-enriched canonical pathways for each population derived using the extended gene set are tabulated in Additional file 5. As expected, the pathways that were found using both the approaches show a significant overlap. Interestingly, there was a very significant overlap in pathways that were detected to be enriched in CPS SNPs between different populations. We also performed an analysis for enrichment of regulatory networks in the CPS SNPs and their corresponding genes.

The first approach was based on the iHS (integrated Haplotype Homozygosity Score) statistic, which in principle involves the detection of unusually long haplotypes of low diversity as signatures of selection . iHS scores for each SNP in the 50-SNP windows which were found to be enriched with CPS SNP were computed using the program iHS_calc . For each 50 SNP window we calculated the proportion of SNPs with |iHS| > 2 which we will call iES (iHS enrichment score).

The observed number for CPS SNP-enriched windows for each population which correspond to the top 1%, 5%, and 10% iES scores were compared with the number of expected windows and the corresponding p-value for each observation was then estimated using bootstrap resampling. The results show that although some of the CPS SNP-enriched windows show significant iHS score enrichment, the overall distribution does not indicate any significant association of selection with these windows (Figure 5A).", "To test for selective sweeps on the basis of allele frequency differentiation rather than haplotype lengths we used the population branch statistic (PBS); which has been found to be very useful in detecting high altitude adaptation-related SNPs in Tibetans relative to Han Chinese and Danish populations, as an alternative approach for detecting signatures of selective sweeps in CPS SNP-enriched windows . PBS can be thought of as an estimate of the allele frequency change at a given locus in the history of a population since its divergence from another population. The idea behind this analysis is that if we consider two related populations and an outlier population, the allele frequency changes at any locus in these two populations should be equidistant (or have similar branch length) from the outlier", ". Functional enrichment analysis of genes containing the CPS SNP was performed and the enriched functional classes for different populations were compared to identify possible functional trajectories in population-specific SNP evolution.", "Eleven coding non-synonymous CPS SNPs were observed in the YRI mapping to10 different genes, 8 of them were predicted to be functional by at least one of the tools.

Moreover, a functional SNP was detected in TRIM5 which is a capsid-specific restriction factor involved in blocking viral replication early in the life cycle. Additionally, two coding non-synonymous SNPs were detected in the UPK3B gene which plays an important role in AUM-cytoskeleton interaction in terminally differentiated urothelial cells.", "We have used 1000 Genomes sequence data (release October 2012), including more than one thousand individuals from 14 populations spanning Europe, Asia, Africa and America, to identify SNPs and structural variants that are private or specific to each population and to study their genomic distribution and potential functional relevance . However, as the population sample sizes are relatively small (<100) and the sequencing is low coverage (4X-6X) for most of the 1000 Genomes data, low frequency alleles are harder to accurately identify and may be incorrectly identified as population-specific . We have therefore focused our study on common population-specific (CPS) SNPs as higher MAF population-specific SNPs are expected to be more informative and less likely to be incorrectly annotated as population-specific in this dataset", ". Moreover, a recent study aimed at identifying loci under parallel divergence (loci that have undergone moderate allele frequency changes in multiple independent human lineages) found most parallel divergent genes to occur in this pathway . This may explain our observation for CPS SNP enrichment in the corresponding genomic regions in multiple populations. It is also interesting to note that several recent studies have shown this pathway to be one of the major mutational targets in pancreatic and other cancers [89\u201391]. It would be an interesting follow up study to probe whether evolutionary forces, like mutation rate, might contribute to the observed SNP accumulation in regions where genes for these pathways occur and whether this enrichment has any adaptive relevance", "One of the concerns with using all the current populations of the 1000 Genomes data for identifying population-specific SNPs is the inclusion of populations with known recent admixture, such as ASW and MXL (Supplementary Figures S4 and S9 from reference 18). The inclusion of these admixed populations may mask the true population specificity of SNPs. In order to identify SNPs which are truly unique to populations, ASW and the three American populations (MXL, PML and PUR), which are known to have undergone a significant amount of admixture in the recent past, were removed from the dataset . It is worth noting, however, that the MXL, CLM and PUR populations contain a few hundred common SNPs which were not observed in any other continent/population", "Abecasis GR, Altshuler D, Auton A, Brooks LD, Durbin RM, Gibbs RA, Hurles ME, McVean GA: A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing.

For the Asian populations (JPT and CHINESE) and European populations (IBS and FIN), YRI was used as the outlier population. Similarly, for the African populations YRI and LWK, the JPT population was used as the outlier. Although the choice of outlier for the populations might be questionable from a population history perspective, the distances within these populations suggest that this set can still provide reasonable estimates of branch lengths. For each 3-population set (e.g. YRI-LWK-JPT or JPT-CHB-YRI), we estimated the background distribution of the PBS scores, using 10,000 randomly-selected 50-SNP windows. We then identified score cut-offs based on the top 1%, 5% and 10% of the background distribution and estimated the number of 50-SNP windows which can be expected to be in the top 1%, 5% and 10% PBS score range for a population", "Results and discussion\nIdentifying SNPs unique to each population", "Interestingly, the longest blocks and the highest scoring windows show significant overlap in some populations (Tables 2 and 3). For example, one of the longest blocks as well as one of the most CPS SNP dense windows was detected near the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene in the YRI population. Sequence variants identified in the SLCO1B1 gene have been associated with altered transport activity and it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms in the gene have an impact on the inter-individual variability of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of specific drugs . Previous studies have also observed unique genetic diversity in the SLCO1B1 gene between populations with the greatest diversity among African populations . Similar overlap was also observed in the RAP1 interacting factor homolog (RIF1) gene in the CHINESE population", "The second approach was to use a sliding window of 5 kilobases (kb). This approach, in addition to identifying CPS SNP-enriched regions, provides a more direct way to identify possible overlap within CPS SNP-enriched windows across populations. Using this scan, 565 5-kb regions were found to be significantly enriched for CPS SNPs in the 6 populations (Table 1). For each of the populations there was a very significant amount of overlap between the regions identified by the two sliding window based approaches (Table 1). The comparison of enriched windows identified using both the sliding window approaches shows that there is almost no overlap within the CPS SNP-enriched regions in these six populations (Figure 4). The second interesting aspect revealed by both the 50-SNP windows and 5-kb windows based approaches is that for many genomic regions the run of enrichment extends far beyond a single or couple of windows", "Functional categories and pathway distribution of CPS SNPs", "To study the functional relevance of the CPS SNPs we analysed their localization with respect to known genes. As seen in the case of most novel variants identified by the 1000 Genomes project , as well as what can be expected on the basis of the background distribution of SNPs, most of the CPS SNPs were found to be either intergenic or intronic (Figure 7). Despite certain minor variations, for example in FIN and JPT, the overall distribution of the CPS SNPs in different major genomic regions was observed to be similar in all the populations. Interestingly however, the number of coding non-synonymous CPS SNPs in these populations (Table 4) were found be independent of the total number of CPS SNPs in them. These coding non-synonymous CPS SNPs were found to occur in roughly equal numbers in YRI, LWK and JPT, only a single CPS SNP was detected in the IBS, and were missing in the FIN and CHINESE populations", ". As our aim was to identify common SNPs which are unique in different populations, and we know that these populations have a common recent origin, we merged the two Chinese populations CHB and CHS into a single population (named CHINESE for this study).

The two highest-scoring windows detected for each population using this scan are shown in Table 2. In the highest-scoring windows for both LWK and YRI more than 50% of the SNPs were found to be CPS SNPs.", ". The analysis of coldspots at both 1% and 5% levels, on the other hand, show that these sites are highly under-represented in the CPS SNP-enriched regions. A similar analysis for other populations using the combined map (hapMapRelease24CombinedRecombMap) shows that the trend of very significant enrichment of these hotspots and significant depletion of the recombination coldspots is consistently seen in all populations (Figure 6B). A combined analysis of CPS SNP-enriched windows from all the populations taken together also shows the same trend (Figure 6B).", ". This result concurs with the known history of recent migration and admixture of the Western African populations in North America . However, in spite of this increase in the number of the CPS SNPs in the YRI, after removal of admixed populations, they still have only about half the number of CPS SNPs observed in LWK. This difference is, however, not surprising in view of the fact that a number of different populations, which most probably include the LWK along with other Bantu-speaking populations, have migrated to East Africa at different time points in history [41\u201344]. The migration of several different populations along with the presence of indigenous East-African Khoesan-speaking populations in this region, which has been suggested to have contributed to the population differentiation in East-Africa, might also explain the high frequency of CPS SNPs and RPS SNPs observed in the LWK .", "Palo JU, Ulmanen I, Lukka M, Ellonen P, Sajantila A: Genetic markers and population history: Finland revisited.

The CPS SNP clusters observed in our study are somewhat similar to the clusters which show high allele frequency differentiation within populations as they represent genomic regions which vary widely across populations. However, there is an inherent difference in that in these regions both the SNP composition and SNP density is different in a single population compared to others.

Although differences in SNP allele frequencies might be influenced by various demographic factors like selection and population size, time is the major determinant in the rise or fall of allele frequencies.

Although more than 99% of population specific SNPs in the 1000 Genomes data are RPS SNPs, we have focused our present study on CPS SNPs because the sample sizes (around 90\u2013100 individuals for each population) and low coverage sequencing (around 4X for most of the genomic regions) used for generating the data make it difficult to reliably ascertain the population specificity of low allele frequency SNPs. Moreover, as these SNPs have a MAF of at least 0.05 they are less likely to be personal SNPs or the result of recent demographic events.", "Conclusions\nCommon population-specific SNPs are non-randomly distributed throughout the genome and are significantly associated with recombination hotspots. Since the variant alleles of most CPS SNPs are the derived allele, they likely arose in the specific population after a split from a common ancestor. Their proximity to genes involved in specific pathways, including neuronal development, suggests evolutionary plasticity of selected genomic regions. Contrary to expectation, selective sweeps did not play a large role in the persistence of population-specific variation. This suggests a stochastic process towards population-specific variation which reflects demographic histories and may have some interesting implications for health and susceptibility to disease.\nBackground", ". The functional impact of these non-synonymous coding CPS SNPs was assessed using a combination of four different SNP function prediction tools (SIFT, Polyphen 2, LRT, Mutation taster) which predicted most of these SNPs to have a potential functional impact [79\u201382]. The list of coding non-synonymous SNPs along with their predicted functional significance is summarized in Table 4.", "SNPs and structural variants are often classified into \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018shared\u2019 based on their distribution in a single population or a range of populations. The term private however might imply different things based on the context, for example, a SNP might be private to an individual or a family, or to a population (monomorphic in all but one population; also referred to as \u2018population private\u2019) or to an ancestral group. Therefore, we will use the term \u2018population-specific\u2019 for the SNPs that have been found to occur only in a single population. Although private SNPs have not been shown to be involved in major phenotypic traits or common diseases, population-specific SNPs might well be important in ascribing characteristic phenotypes and disease susceptibility/protection to a population .", ". Similar overlap was observed in many other CPS SNP-enriched pathways including protein kinase A signalling and CREB Signaling in Neurons (Figure 8), which points to underlying functional similarities in the distribution of CPS SNPs in different populations.", ". Additional files 2 and 3 contain the full list of windows identified using these approaches, and the SNPs included in them. Interestingly, despite fewer CPS SNPs and the presence of only a few enriched windows, two significantly long stretches of enrichment are observed in the CHINESE population. Similarly, although the number of enriched windows in Japanese is less than one third of that of the YRI, the Japanese population seem to harbour much longer enriched window stretches in comparison to the YRI population, and this enrichment cannot be explained solely on the basis of increased LD in the Japanese compared to the YRI These observations taken together indicate that the bias in distribution of CPS SNPs is largely independent of the size of the datasets and the enriched windows or window blocks may represent genomic regions significant in terms of function or population histories.", ". While the high frequency of CPS SNPs in the Finnish population (FIN) can be interpreted in terms of multiple genetic components and demographic factors like isolation, migration and admixture, which is reflected in their distinctive distribution in the European principal component analysis (PCA) plots in other studies , the high frequency of CPS SNPs in the Spanish (IBS) population needs to be treated with greater caution as the number of individuals sequenced for this population is only 14. Many of the SNPs which seem to be common (MAF > 0.05) in the IBS in the present data might turn out to be rare once other samples from this population are sequenced.Although our analysis is focused on SNPs, we studied the distribution of population-specific short structural variants (SSVs) to see whether their distribution in different populations concurs with that of the SNPs", "5-kb windows", "Xu S, Yin X, Li S, Jin W, Lou H, Yang L, Gong X, Wang H, Shen Y, Pan X, He Y, Yang Y, Wang Y, Fu W, An Y, Wang J, Tan J, Qian J, Chen X, Zhang X, Sun Y, Zhang X, Wu B, Jin L: Genomic dissection of population substructure of Han Chinese and its implication in association studies.

Therefore, in addition to the functional role of these SNPs, the population-specific SNPs might also play an important role in characterizing ancestry and understanding demographic histories . For example, on a genome wide scale the number of population-specific SNPs in a population would be expected to be related to the age of the population and also to reflect demographic events like bottlenecks, geographical isolation and admixtures.", "The relatively high frequency of CPS SNPs as well as RPS SNPs in the Japanese population is notable. It is well known that the modern Japanese population contains admixtures of at least two distinct genetic components; the old migrants who migrated to the Japanese Archipelago approximately 30,000 years ago and the new migrants that reached Japan only about a couple of thousand years ago [45\u201347]. It would be interesting to study how far the unique components of both these, and perhaps other migrating populations, add up to generate the high RPS SNPs and CPS SNPs observed in the JPT population.In addition to population histories, the sample size is also a strong determinant of how many variants and unique variants are observed in a population. For example, the huge increase in the frequency of RPS SNPs in the Chinese populations after the merger (Figure 1D) is also an outcome of the increase in sample size due to merging of the populations", ". Based on the genomic distribution of recombination rates in YRI we estimated the number of hotspot sites expected to occur in CPS SNP-enriched windows for the YRI population. The observed rates were compared with the expected rates and the statistical significance of enrichment of recombination hotspots were estimated at both 1% and 5% levels. The CPS SNP-enriched regions defined on the basis of both length (5-kb) and 50-SNP windows were analysed separately. The frequency of sites with the top 1% and 5% recombination rates in both sets of YRI-specific CPS SNP-enriched regions in comparison to the respective background distributions of genomics regions with the top 1% and 5% recombination rates has been summarized in Figure 6A. It is clear that for both kinds of windows and at both levels (top 1% and 5%) the recombination hotspots were highly enriched in the population specific SNP-enriched genomic regions", "Avenues for future exploration have been highlighted. However, there are several caveats. Firstly, the number of individuals per population for whom we have full genome sequences is presently low (N < 100). Secondly, the definition of a population in terms of origin and admixture is at times vague and increased mobility worldwide leads to elevated levels of admixture. Moreover, the numbers of variants analysed is only a small subset (<1%) of all population-specific variants since rare variants (MAF < 0.05) have not been included. Genome sequencing of global populations is providing data which will assist in teasing out ancestral populations and will shed further light on population differentiation and adaptation", ". Therefore, if recombination hotspots play a role in generating CPS SNP clusters the occurrence of these regions at different genomic positions in different populations becomes explainable.", ". Figure 2 shows the distribution of the common population specific structural variants (CPS SSVs) and rare population-specific structural variants (RPS SSVs). Interestingly, the relative prevalence of the SSVs across populations shows high concordance with that of SNPs. However, the numbers observed for rare and common SSVs are similar in contrast to the few fold difference observed in the number of common and rare SNPs.", "Boyle AP, Hong EL, Hariharan M, Cheng Y, Schaub MA, Kasowski M, Karczewski KJ, Park J, Hitz BC, Weng S, Cherry JM, Snyder M: Annotation of functional variation in personal genomes using RegulomeDB.

Although there are quite a few other tests for detecting selective sweeps  which could have been employed for this dataset and might have identified a few more CPS SNP-enriched windows to be under selective sweeps, it is unlikely that they would change the landscape fundamentally and it can be safely concluded that selection is not the major factor causing CPS SNP enrichment in certain genomic regions. However, the efficiency of existing methodologies for detecting signatures of selection in datasets like the current 1000 Genomes dataset (which contain a large proportion low frequency SNPs, sequenced on a low coverage platform) is an important concern as genome wide variation in error rates might easily mask true signals and generate false positive signals of signature of selection", "For example, the highest number for both CPS SNPs and the RPS SNPs was observed in the LWK population followed by the Japanese (JPT) population. Interestingly, in contrast to the large number of RPS SNPs observed, just a few CPS SNPs were found to occur in the Chinese populations (CHB and CHS). This observation is consistent with the fact that these populations have a similar geographic origin, and the differentiation between them probably started little more than a thousand years ago with the Southward migration of the Northern Han population [37\u201339]. In spite of the pronounced divergence of these populations, reflected in the high frequency of RPS SNPs and has also been observed in many previous studies, the relatively recent divergence has not allowed many of the population-specific alleles to reach frequencies of 0.05 [37\u201339]", "The next major wave of information about genetic and genomic diversity in human populations came from studies based on exome and whole genome sequencing [16\u201319]. The 1000 Genomes Project, for example, in addition to identifying millions of novel SNPs and more than a million short structural variants (SSVs), showed that rare variants account for a large majority of the existing genetic diversity between individuals as well as within populations . Moreover, it was suggested that there is an excess of rare and deleterious mutations in human genomes, probably resulting from exponential population growth and weak purifying selection . Studies based on deep sequencing of selected regions from thousands of individuals further show that the majority of rare coding variants, with allele frequencies lower than 0.0005, are also population-specific and potentially deleterious ", "Additionally, a total of 520 CPS SNPs with probable consequences for gene regulation, all from RegulomeDB category 2, which demonstrates direct evidence of a binding through ChIP-seq and DNase data with either a matched position weight matrix to the ChIP-seq factor or a DNase footprint, were identified (Additional file 4) . Of the putative regulatory variants identified, the majority are intergenic (234) and intronic (224). Approximately 3 times as many upstream (24) compared to downstream (7) variants were identified, while 3\u2032-UTR variants were approximately double the number in the 5\u2032-UTR. The occurrence of these potential regulatory SNPs, in addition to the potentially functional coding non-synonymous CPS SNPs indicate that in spite of occurring in a single population, at least some of the CPS SNPs might play a significant functional role in some of these populations.", ". The regions containing the longest stretches of enriched 50-SNP windows have been summarized in Table 3.", ". However, these studies were based on a fixed number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which had clear ascertainment bias (the SNPs included in the genotyping platforms were selected on the basis of their occurrence and frequencies primarily in European populations), therefore it was difficult to reliably assess the nature and extent of genomic diversity that exists among different populations from these studies .", "Tennessen JA, Akey JM: Parallel adaptive divergence among geographically diverse human populations.

In addition to thousands of contemporary human genomes, sequencing of many archaic genomes has also been performed recently which has provided evidence for archaic admixture in non-African genomes [20\u201322]. Such admixture might also be present in at least some of the African populations . These studies taken together have not only resulted in a paradigm shift in our understanding of various aspects of human genomic diversity but also provided necessary data for addressing numerous other questions related to human genome evolution.", "The global diversity of human genomes is the outcome of a series of demographic and evolutionary events including migration, bottlenecks, admixture, population isolation, natural selection and genetic drift which occurred in different parts of the world at various time points in history [1\u20133]. Genomic signatures of many of these events have been preserved in the genomes of different populations and play a pivotal role in uncovering demographic histories in addition to understanding health and disease . In the last decade, two major large consortium based efforts; the HapMap project, the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), as well as several other studies, based on genotyping of single nucleotide changes, have attempted to catalogue the genetic variations that exist between individuals of a population as well as within different populations across continents [6\u201311].", "The calculation of PBS was carried out following the methods proposed by Yi and colleagues . For calculating PBS scores for the African populations (YRI and LWK), JPT was used as an outlier. For the Asian populations CHINESE and JPT, YRI was used as an outlier. Similarly for the European populations (FIN and IBS) YRI was used as the outlier. For each three population set (like YRI-LWK-JPT or JPT-CHB-YRI) we estimated the background distribution of the PBS scores, using 10,000, randomly selected 50-SNP windows. We then identified score cut-offs based on the top 1%, 5% and 10% of the background distribution and estimated the number of 50-SNP and 5-kb windows which can be expected to be in the top 1% ,5% and 10% PBS score range for a population. The number of observed windows in the 1%, 5% and 10% range was compared to the expected number and the corresponding p-values were estimated using a bootstrap analysis.\nRecombination rate", "Despite their potential significance, population-specific SNPs have not been studied extensively. Previous HapMap data based studies on population-specific SNPs have been able to identify only a small number of population-specific SNPs due to ascertainment bias of the genotyping platform [6, 33\u201335]. The availability of unbiased whole genome sequence data from sources like the 1000 Genomes project, however, has now made the identification and characterization of population-specific SNPs on a genome wide scale possible. Moreover, sequencing-based studies have shown population-specific SNPs to be one of the major components of genetic diversity within populations [17\u201319, 36]. A deeper understanding of population-specific variations, their genomic distribution and potential functional relevance is important.", ". We evaluated the frequency distribution of population-specific SNPs identified in our study in the context of the generally accepted model of population migration and differentiation. We analysed the genomic distribution of these SNPs using fixed length and fixed bin window scan based approaches to identify potential biases in genomic distribution of CPS SNPs. The CPS SNP-enriched genomic regions in different populations were then compared to test whether their preferential localization has overlaps across different populations. Analyses of signatures of selection and the distribution of recombination hotspots were performed in the CPS SNP-enriched genomic regions to determine the extent of involvement of these processes in generating CPS SNP-enriched genomic regions in different populations", "The relative prevalence of the CPS SNPs (as well as RPS SNPs and SSVs) across populations, therefore, shows high concordance with what can be expected on the basis of the generally accepted model of population divergence and the relationships between populations. However, as has been demonstrated, the number of population-specific SNPs observed in any population, in addition to population histories, is also influenced by factors like sample size and number of related and/or admixed populations included in the study. The removal of the admixed African and American populations almost doubled the number of common SNPs which were detected to be population-specific in the other 9 populations, indicating how important the detection and control of admixture is for identifying what is truly population-specific", "One of the major achievements of the 1000 Genomes project has been the identification of numerous novel SNPs across different populations . The sequence-based approach employed in the 1000 Genomes project in contrast to the previous genotyping-based approaches like HGDP and HapMap, provides an unbiased estimate of human genetic variation across many populations globally . We have used the most recent version (October 2012) of the 1000 Genomes data to identify SNPs which are observed to be unique to each of the individual study populations . These SNPs were categorized into CPS SNPs and rare population-specific (RPS) SNPs based on a MAF cut-off of 0.05. SNPs with MAF >0.05 were considered as CPS SNPs while SNPs with lower MAFs were considered as RPS SNPs", "In the first approach, a window was defined as a set of 50 contiguous SNPs and each chromosome was scanned along the 50-SNP windows (with a slide of 50 SNPs per step) separately for each population. In each step the fraction of CPS SNPs in each window was recorded and compared to an expected value, based on the occurrence of CPS SNPs on the corresponding chromosome for the particular population. The statistical significance of the observations was estimated using cumulative hyper geometric p-values calculated for each window. The results clearly identified specific regions of the genome to be enriched with CPS SNPs in each population. We detected 655 CPS SNP-enriched windows/regions in the 6 populations (Table 1, Additional file 2). The populations CEU, TSI and GBR were not analysed due to a paucity of CPS SNPs.

Therefore, we ran two independent sets of analysis in which the iES scores were defined on the basis of lowered thresholds of iHS > 1.75 and iHS > 1.5, respectively. However, no distinct enrichment of iHS scores was observed even in the lower threshold sets. Results from the analysis of the 5-kb windows were also found to be very similar to that obtained with the 50-SNP windows. It should, however, be kept in mind that iHS in itself might not be a very good metric for testing selective sweeps in a dataset which is known to contain many CPS SNPs of moderate allele frequencies because, unless on a single haplotype, these SNPs will have a tendency to disrupt long haplotype blocks", ".

Whole genome datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (October 2012) provide an unbiased view of genetic variation across populations from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Common population-specific SNPs (MAF > 0.05) reflect a deep history and may have important consequences for health and wellbeing. Their interpretation is contextualised by currently available genome data.\nResults", ". Moreover, as the width of a recombination hotspot (1\u20132 kb) is significant with respect to length of the sliding windows (5 kb or 50 SNP) used in the analysis, the presence of even a single hotspot can lower the LD of the region covered within the window considerably. The enrichment of recombination hotspots, therefore suggests that LD blocks are probably shorter and that LD is probably lower in the CPS SNP-enriched regions compared to average genomic regions. Moreover, in addition to recombination rate associated SNP density variations, the high recombination rates also suggest that the effects of population admixtures will be more prominent in these regions, which might also be an important source of the observed CPS SNP clusters.

Firstly, we showed that CPS SNPs are abundant but are not randomly distributed and can cluster into regions that can span up to several kilobases. Secondly we have illustrated that at least some of the CPS SNPs are likely to have a phenotypic or functional impact. Thirdly, in terms of mechanism, we were unable to detect any evidence for selection in the regions of high CPS SNP density but interestingly, these regions more often associate with regions of high recombination. The enrichment of recombination hotspots in a way also indicates that the LD in the CPS SNP-enriched region is lower than that in the average genome and rules out any possible role of LD in generating CPS enriched regions", "We retrieved the deCODE recombination map and the HapMap related recombination maps (hapMapRelease24YRIRecombMap and hapMapRelease24CombinedRecombMap) using the UCSC table browser . The distribution of recombination hotspots from the deCODE recombination map using a SRR (sex-standardized recombination rate) cut-off of 10 found only a few hotspots in the gene set and were not analysed further.", "50-SNP windows", "The Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)  is an online tool that accepts a list of genes as input and performs functional analysis on them. It provides a list of functions enriched in the gene list, and clusters these functions according to their similarity. Functions include gene ontology (GO) and Swiss-Prot annotation, InterPro matches, OMIM  and other disease links, as well as KEGG  and other pathway database links. The gene-enrichment analysis is based on the Fisher\u2019s Exact test, which determines whether or not a given list of genes is enriched for a certain function label or if this function occurs in the list by chance. A p-value shows the significance and adjusted p-values are also provided, after correction for multiple testing. The gene lists for each population that contained CPS SNPs were run through DAVID to identify overrepresented pathways and other functional labels.", "In the LWK population 12 coding non-synonymous CPS SNPs in 11 genes were observed, 5 of which are linked to disease phenotypes. These include ABCA4, linked to Stargardt disease 1, hereditary macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa; ATP8B1, associated with various forms of cholestasis, GHR, which is linked to Laron syndrome, resulting in growth impairment; MCCC1, involved in methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency, and two SNPs in NLRP12 gene, which is associated with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome. In the JPT population 8 non-synonymous CPS SNPs, all of which were predicted to be functional, were observed in 8 genes. Some of these genes were found to be involved in melatonin activity, melanogenesis, olfaction and hair formation. Only a single non-synonymous CPS SNP was detected in the MRP35 gene in the IBS population, whereas none was found to occur in the CHINESE and the FIN populations.", "To identify possible functional preference in the distribution of CPS SNPs in different populations we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA)  and DAVID  to identify functional classes, metabolic pathways and regulatory networks enriched in CPS SNPs in each population. The populations CEU, GBR and TSI, were excluded from this analysis as they contain too few CPS SNPs for generating statistically and biologically meaningful results. The top 5 canonical pathways found to be overrepresented in the CPS SNPs for each population using IPA are shown in Figure 8. We also prepared an extended gene list for each population which, in addition to genes for coding and intronic SNPs included nearby genes for the intergenic SNPs. This set was created to provide a more inclusive view of the functional preference as intergenic SNPs which form large proportion of CPS SNPs, are completely excluded from the pathway analysis", ". The availability of more extensive data along with an increased depth of sequencing, which permits the reliable study of rare genetic variants and structural variants, is therefore required for a better understanding of the relationship between unique genotypic variations and their geographical contexts.", ". While the lack of CPS SNPs in most European populations is not very surprising considering their population histories, as well as the number of populations (5 European populations in contrast to only 2 African and 3 Asian population) included in the dataset, it would be interesting to see how strongly the inclusion of other populations from Asia and Africa change the number of population-specific SNPs as new data pour in.", ". The number of observed windows in the 1%, 5% and 10% range was compared to the expected number and the corresponding P-values were estimated using a bootstrap analysis. Figure 5B summarizes the PBS score distribution for the Asian and African populations. None of the windows which were found to be enriched with CPS SNPs in FIN and IBS were found to be in the top 1%, 5% or 10% range for the respective populations and hence were not retained for further analysis. It can be seen that, although some of the populations have some enrichment of high PBS scores in the CPS SNP-enriched windows, their lack of statistical significance as well as the overall distribution of PBS scores do not suggest that selection is common in these regions (Figure 5B)", "Myles S, Tang K, Somel M, Green RE, Kelso J, Stoneking M: Identification and analysis of genomic regions with large between-population differentiation in humans.

Similarly the combined HapMap recombination map (hapMapRelease24CombinedRecombMap) was used to identify recombination hotspots and coldspots for all other populations .We studied the genomic distribution of the recombination rates from the YRI-specific map and the genomic regions corresponding to the top 1% recombination rates were defined as recombination hotspots for YRI.

The haplotype homozygosity based iHS score was calculated using the WHAMM package . As calculation of iHS requires physical positions to be specified, we downloaded the combined linkage physical map for human genome build GrCh37 from Rutgers Map  and incorporated the physical positions into the existing data. For each population, iHS scores for SNPs occurring in the 50-SNP windows which were found to be enriched in CPS SNPs in that population were calculated using the iHS_calc script from the WHAMM package. To estimate the background iHS distribution for each population, we randomly sampled 10,000 50-SNP blocks and calculated the iHS scores for the SNPs occurring in these blocks. Based on allele frequency bins derived from the background, the iHS scores were then standardized", "The trimming and rearrangement of the population datasets resulted in 9 potentially independent and essentially non-admixed populations for further investigation in the current study. The distribution of the CPS SNPs and RPS SNPs for each population was recalculated considering these 9 populations only, and has been summarized in Figure 1C and D. The list of SNPs which were observed to be unique to each population along with their frequencies in the 14 study populations has been provided in Additional file 1. Although the removal of the admixed populations significantly increased the count of CPS SNPs for all the populations, the detected trends, for example the highest number of SNPs in LWK, followed by JPT, IBS and FIN, are similar in both sets (Figure 1A, C, B and D). An interesting exception is the YRI population, where the number of YRI specific CPS SNPs goes up by folds with the removal of the admixed African American population", "Role of recombination rate", "In order to identify non-coding CPS SNPs that may have an effect on the binding of regulatory factors, intronic variants and those flanking genes were searched against the RegulomeDB database , which employs a heuristic scoring system based on the confidence that the variant lies in a regulatory element and whether it has known or possible functional consequences such as alteration of Transcript Factor (TF) binding and changes in expression patterns of the associated gene(s). dbSNP  variants are classified into 6 categories, with category 1 having highest confidence due to associated eQTL data, and category 6 the lowest. Only CPS SNPs belonging to categories 1 and 2 were considered to be regulation-modifying, since they are the most likely to result in a functional consequence.\nIPA analysis", "The present 1000 Genomes data contain two African (YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), LWK (Luhya in Webuye, Kenya)), three Asian (JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan), CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China) and CHS (Han Chinese South)), three American (MXL (Mexican Ancestry in Los Angeles, CA, USA), PUR (Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico) and CLM (Colombians in Medell\u00edn, Colombia)), 5 European (IBS (Iberian Populations in Spain), GBR (British from England and Scotland), CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe), FIN (Finnish in Finland) and TSI (Toscani in Italia)) and one admixed African (ASW (African Ancestry in SW USA)) population. The frequencies of common and rare population-specific SNPs in these populations have been summarized in Figure 1A and Figure 1B, respectively. Although the numbers of common and rare SNP differ by many folds, there are some broad similarities in the distribution patterns of the CPS SNPs and RPS SNPs.", "We found that three of the European populations (CEU, GBR and TSI) have only a handful of common SNPs unique to them in contrast to a few hundred thousand rare SNPs. While this makes sense in terms of demographics  and probable admixtures, it might also be a result of treating these related or partially admixed populations separately. Approaches that group these populations together, based on population histories, might lead to the identification of some CPS SNPs in these groups too", "Weir BS, Cardon LR, Anderson AD, Nielsen DM, Hill WG: Measures of human population structure show heterogeneity among genomic regions.

As the SNP densities in the CPS SNP-enriched windows are higher in a single population compared to others, we considered whether there was any relationship between CPS SNP-enriched windows and higher recombination rates. To test the association of CPS SNP-enriched genomic regions with meiotic recombination rates, we obtained recombination hotspots based on the recombination maps generated by deCODE . The distribution of recombination hotspots from the deCODE recombination map using a SRR (sex-standardized recombination rate) cut-off of 10 found only a handful of recombination hotspots within the CPS SNP-enriched regions in all populations taken together ", "Although this analysis shows a very clear trend, as the maps used in this study are LD based, further evidence in terms of experimentally derived data for at least some of these regions will be required to reliably establish the relationship between recombination hotspots and CPS SNP-enriched windows. Nevertheless, the observed enrichment of recombination hotspots in CPS SNP-enriched genomic regions hints that high recombination might be one of the factors contributing to the generation of CPS SNP clusters. The presence of recombination hotspot(s) in a short genomic region (5 kb or 50 SNP), especially in case of a genotype based recombination map like the one used here, clearly indicates the LD architecture to be complex and the LD blocks to be short within that particular region", ". Development of parameters and efficient quality control measures well suited for identifying signatures of selection in such a dataset will significantly contribute to future work in this direction.", "The HapMap YRI recombination map (hapMapRelease24YRIRecombMap) was used to identify recombination hotspots and coldspots in YRI and the combined dataset. The distribution of recombination rates was studied to select genomic regions showing the top 1% recombination rate scores and these regions were designated as recombination hotspots. We also used the top 5% recombination rate scores to select a second set of hotspots. Similarly, the two sets of coldspots likewise were defined by the lowest 1% and 5% recombination rates. Based on the genomic distribution of recombination rates in YRI (hapMapRelease24YRIRecombMap) we estimated the number of hotspot sites expected to occur in CPS SNP-enriched windows for YRI", ". As the sample size for the population has doubled the frequency of detection of RPS SNPs has increased proportionately and similar changes can be expected to be observed in other populations in the future as more samples from these populations are sequenced. Similarly, the lack of RPS SNPs in the IBS population in comparison to other populations can be ascribed to the inclusion of only 14 IBS samples in the current 1000 Genomes data set. It can be expected that as more samples are sequenced the fraction of RPS SNPs in this population will be in line with other populations.", ".

The second scenario is that the variant originated before differentiation of populations, survives in only a single population, and gets eliminated from other populations. In cases where the population-specific allele is the ancestral allele, both the alleles are estimated to have evolved far back in evolutionary history and the derived allele replaces the ancestral allele in all but one of the populations, probably through selective sweeps. Alternatively, in some cases, the assignment of ancestral state may be incorrect. The other possible scenario by which population-specific SNPs might originate is by admixture with populations which are not included in the study or even populations which are no longer extant", "The distribution of SNPs has for long been known to be non-random across the genome [52\u201355]. Recent studies have further suggested that the rates of mutations in a genomic region in addition to the genomic context might also depend on the presence of repeat sequences and even existing SNPs in the region . Moreover, genomic regions where genomes from different global populations differ very strongly from each other have also been observed . Given this background it was interesting to investigate whether the CPS SNPs, as delineated in our study, also show clustered occurrences across the genome. To identify possible biases in the distribution of CPS SNPs in each population and test whether the enriched regions are similar in different populations we used a sliding window based scan", ".

Leafy greens, broccoli, lentils, and many beans are great sources of folate, fiber, and other nutrients.\n- Because MTHFR impacts the process of methylation, it is also recommended to take a methylated (and more usable) form of B12, known as methylcobalamin, rather than the more commonly available cyanocobalamin form. B12 absorption is essential for good mental health, and is also compromised by the MTHFR mutation and the other factors listed above.\n- Speak with your healthcare provider about what the your nutritional and vitamin regimen should consist of, including what doses would be most appropriate for you.", "- If you are planning a pregnancy and are positive for an MTHFR mutation, you may also need to add either low-dose aspirin or a blood thinner to your regimen to reduce the risk of blood clots associated with early miscarriage. Again, consult your healthcare provider to see if this is appropriate for you.\n- Finally, if one or both parents carry an MTHFR mutation, and particularly if your child has attentional difficulties or other cognitive or mental health issues, speak with your child\u2019s pediatrician about whether you should supplement his or her diet with l-methylfolate, and at what dose.\nFor more, see the National Institutes of Health information on MTHFR.\nReferences\nGilbody, S., Lewis, S. & Lightfoot, T.

One function that is particularly important to mental health is the conversion of an essential B-vitamin, folate, into the more usable form, l-methylfolate.\nL-Methylfolate enables our bodies to convert the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body then uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds, including neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). These brain chemicals are essential for a number of aspects of mental health; thus, when this process is impaired, it can increase the likelihood of the mental health issues mentioned previously. In addition, when the enzyme is not working at normal capacity, it can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular and other health problems.", "In addition to having an MTHFR mutation, there are other factors associated with decreased folate levels or poor absorption, including malnutrition, gastrointestinal illness, and high alcohol consumption. If you have an MTHFR mutation and/or one of the above issues, it is important to know that you will have reduced ability to metabolize folic acid, the synthetic form of folate that is found in processed foods (e.g., breads, cereals) and vitamins.\nWhat You Can Do\nThere are some simple and inexpensive steps one can take to reduce the risks associated with MTHFR mutations, possibly improve response to antidepressant therapies, and feel better in general:", "Jamil, K.

The current data suggest that between 6 and 14% of Caucasians and about 2% of those of African descent probably have a more severe (two mutated alleles) version of the mutation. In Hispanics, this number may be as high as 21%.\nBut even having one mutated allele is associated with an increased risk of certain health problems. For example, having one mutated allele at either of two specific locations is associated with 20-40% reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme (depending on where on the gene the mutation is found). Having two mutated alleles at the same location is associated with a 40-70% reduction in enzyme activity, again, with severity depending upon the location of the mutated alleles. Some people may have two mutated alleles \u2013 one at each of two different locations on the gene \u2014 and that also increases risk of a number of health issues.\nHow Does This Gene Impact Health?", "This post may be of greatest interest to those who have been diagnosed with one of the mental health issues linked to having an MTHFR mutation, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism. MTHFR mutations also increase the risk of several physical health problems, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease and stroke, recurrent early miscarriage, migraine with aura, osteoporosis, and some cancers. So, it\u2019s worth knowing about this mutation even if one or more of the above conditions run in your family.\nResponse to Drugs", "- Speak with your healthcare provider about whether MTHFR testing may be appropriate for you. Your insurance company may or may not cover this expense, but some independent laboratories will process your blood sample for about $200. Before getting tested, it\u2019s worth calling your insurer to see under what circumstances you will be covered for this specific lab test.\n- Swap out folic acid for the more bioavailable form of folate \u2013 l-methylfolate). This is more usable by the body and easily available in health food stores, many pharmacies, and online. L-methylfolate is sometimes referred to as \u201coptimized folate.\u201d\n- Avoid processed foods and supplements containing the folic acid form of folate. It\u2019s not as easily used by people with an MTHFR mutation and may interfere with the absorption of l-methylfolate.", "As you may remember from biology class, genes are pieces of our DNA that control a specific characteristic (such as hair or eye color, etc.). Each gene is made up of two alleles, or specific forms of that gene. In short, genes and their alleles determine what traits we inherit from our ancestors. Sometimes these traits are obvious, such as having blue vs. brown eyes. Other times, the result of a specific trait may not be immediately obvious, such as whether we will like or detest the herb cilantro, metabolize caffeine quickly or slowly, or have increased or decreased risk of a health problem down the road.\nA mutation is a naturally occurring process that causes a specific variation on one or more alleles of a particular gene, changing a sequence in our DNA. Having a mutation on both alleles at a specific location on a gene is generally associated with a greater impact than if only one of a pair of alleles is different from normal.\nHow Common Are MTHFR Mutations?", "Health\nA Genetic Mutation That Can Affect Mental & Physical Health\nMTHFR mutations are linked to depression, ADHD, migraines, miscarriage & more.\nPosted September 5, 2014 Reviewed by Lybi Ma\nKey points\n- Mental health issues associated with a MTHFR mutation include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ADHD.\n- Up to 40% of the population may have an MTHFR mutation of some kind.\n- To reduce the risks associated with a MTHFR mutation, it's important to speak to one's health care provider.\nMTHFR is the acronym for a gene (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) that produces an essential enzyme.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nThe good news is that in the early spring of 2024, COVID-19 cases were down, with far fewer infections and hospitalizations than were seen in the previous winter. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, is still mutating, raising concerns about a potential wave of infections this summer. In April, a group of new virus strains known as the FLiRT variants (based on the technical names of their two mutations) began to spread, followed in June by a variant known as LB.1.", "There is no conclusive information yet about whether a COVID illness will be more severe with the new variants or how symptoms might change.

How can people protect themselves against the FLiRT and LB.1 strains?\nVaccination is still a key strategy, says Dr. Roberts, adding that everyone eligible for COVID vaccination should make sure they are up to date with the latest COVID vaccines. While vaccination may not prevent infection, it significantly lowers a person\u2019s risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID.", "To better understand how the FLiRT strains emerged, it might help to see how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed over time, with new variants forming as mutations emerged in its genetic code. Omicron was a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that took hold in the U.S. in 2021 and began to spawn subvariants of its own. One of those was JN.1, which was identified in September 2023 and spread through the country during the winter months, leading to a spike in COVID hospitalizations. JN.1 also has descendants; the FLiRT subvariants are spinoffs of one called JN.1.11.1.\nLB.1 is also descended from JN.1, and researchers are still learning about it and how its additional mutation might set it apart from FLiRT.\n2. What do we know\u2014and not know\u2014about the FLiRT and LB.1 variants?", "\u201cI would especially recommend anyone who qualifies for the vaccine because of advanced age get it if they haven\u2019t already,\u201d Dr. Roberts adds. \u201cThe reason is that the biggest risk factor for a bad outcome from COVID is advanced age.\u201d Anyone over age 65 is eligible for both the first updated vaccine offered in the fall of 2023, and a second shot four months later.\nHe also says COVID tests should be able to detect strains related to JN.1, and antiviral treatments should remain effective against them. Paxlovid, the primary treatment for most people with COVID, acts on a \u201cnonspiked part of the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's relatively variant-proof, so it should really act against many future COVID iterations.\u201d\nOther preventive efforts can help.

As summer began, it was responsible for 14.9% of COVID cases. (The percentages are based on CDC Nowcast estimates, which provide projections that can change as more data is reported.)\nMeanwhile, during the same period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant COVID uptick in several states, based on spikes in emergency room visits and detections of the virus in wastewater. (Wastewater testing can help detect the spread of a COVID in a community.)", "Nobody knows exactly where the FLiRT variants first emerged. They were first detected in the U.S. in wastewater by the CDC, which tests sewage to detect traces of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in a community, even if people don\u2019t have symptoms. (The data can be used as an early warning that infection levels may be increasing or decreasing in a community.) The FLiRT strains have since been identified in several other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom.", "We know the FLiRT variants have two mutations on their spike proteins (the spike-shaped protrusions on the surface of the virus) that weren\u2019t seen on JN.1 (the previously dominant strain in the U.S.). Some experts say these mutations could make it easier for the virus to evade people\u2019s immunity\u2014from the vaccine or a previous bout of COVID.\nWhile more research is needed, experts suspect that the LB.1 strain and another variant called KP.2.3, which also has the two FLiRT mutations plus an additional one, may be more transmissible as well.\nBut, the fact that the variants are otherwise genetically similar to JN.1 should be reassuring, Dr. Roberts says. \"While JN.1 occurred during the winter months, when people gather indoors and the virus is more likely to spread, its symptoms were milder than those caused by variants in the early years of the pandemic,\" he says.", "\u201cViruses mutate all the time, so I\u2019m not surprised to see a new coronavirus variant taking over,\u201d says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD.

Earlier studies by the Abel lab prior to its relocation to UCLA found evidence that the absence of a protein called insulin receptor substrate protein-2 (IRS2), which regulates how insulin affects the heart, could be the culprit: When their hearts were stressed by increased blood pressure, mice with a non-functioning IRS2 gene develop severe ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.", "Additional experiments showed that when IRS2 is functioning normally in heart cells, it blocks a pathway that involves a protein called AKT1. Without IRS2 to suppress its activity, AKT1 alters how the heart handles calcium, which leads to ventricular arrhythmias. The researchers showed that treating mice with dysfunctional IRS2 with a drug that inhibits AKT1 activity prevented them from developing ventricular tachycardia.\nThese findings underscore insulin\u2019s important role in heart rhythm function and shed light on IRS2 as key regulator of the heart\u2019s response to stress. Studies that build upon this work will investigate whether the higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias observed in people with diabetes and obesity can also be linked to IRS2 dysfunction. Earlier research from the Abel lab has already shown that diabetes is associated with alterations to insulin signaling in the heart.", "Given that the IRS2 gene is mutated in about 3% of all cancers, the team from UCLA and the University of Iowa wondered if patients whose cancer has an IRS2 gene mutation are more likely to have heart problems. To find out, they analyzed an anonymized clinical dataset containing information from approximately 200 million patients across 160 health care organizations, including genetic data on patients with cancer. Those whose cancer had IRS2 mutations were not only at greater risk of any cardiac complications, but were two to three times more likely to develop a dangerous cardiac arrhythmia like ventricular tachycardia.", "\u201cThese findings have implications for understanding and treating ventricular arrhythmia risk in this much larger population of at-risk individuals,\u201d Dr. Abel said.\nThis work was conducted with colleagues from the University of Iowa, where Dr. Abel\u2019s laboratory was formerly housed.
