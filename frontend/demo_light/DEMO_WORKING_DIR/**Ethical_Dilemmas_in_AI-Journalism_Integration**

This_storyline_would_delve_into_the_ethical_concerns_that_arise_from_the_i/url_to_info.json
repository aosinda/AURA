Illustration generated by the Midjourney 5.2 text-to-image model, using the prompt \u201cAn abstract image representing the uncertain future of digital journalism in the age of artificial intelligence.\u201d.", "snippets": ["AI and journalism: What's next?\nInnovation in journalism is back. Following a peak of activity in the mid 2010s, the idea of fundamentally reinventing how news might be produced and consumed had gradually become less fashionable, giving way to incrementalism, shallow rhetoric and in some cases even unapologetic \u2018innovation exhaustion.\u2019 No longer. The public release of ChatGPT in late November of 2022 demonstrated capabilities with such obvious and profound potential impact for journalism that AI-driven innovation is now the urgent focus of the senior leadership teams in almost every newsroom. The entire news industry is asking itself \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019?", "This article is based on a distillation of what I have learned from these conversations. It assumes a knowledge of generative AI\u2019s general capabilities and potential, and examines some of the ways that large news organisations are thinking about its strategic and practical implications for their newsrooms. My intent here is to help advance the conversation beyond awareness and towards specific initiatives that can help move newsrooms forward in preparing for an uncertain AI-mediated future.\nAny point of view regarding the application of AI to news is somewhat speculative, especially given the remarkable pace of advancement in AI functionality. Nonetheless, I believe that some clarity may be emerging.", "Given this uncertainty, it may be useful for news organisations to reexamine their technical architectures and infrastructure strategy from the perspective of an increasing need for flexibility. This might involve reexamining build-vs-buy decisions, refactoring brittle, tightly coupled architectures, or even attempting to identify various possible product scenarios and a path to infrastructure that could support those scenarios if they develop.\nAny such reevaluation should consider the many new options for AI-enabled software architectures and AI-enabled software engineering that are appearing. The increasing need for flexible infrastructure is accompanied by new AI-enabled techniques that may make it easier to design, build and maintain such infrastructure.\n4. Organisational structure for AI-empowered teams\nNews organisations will need to operate differently", "Infrastructure is also required to take advantage of opportunities to use LLMs to substantially scale news-gathering by monitoring and analysing large volumes of source documents \u2013 perhaps as part of a differentiation strategy focused on competitively defensible coverage of a particular news domain.\nA starting point is infrastructure that enables constant access to source material, which might exist in different text formats, or in audio or video form that must first be converted to text transcripts using AI speech-to-text tools, or possibly even in large datasets that are frequently updated. Such \u2018monitoring\u2019 infrastructure might range from a simple list of sources to a complex web crawler that continually \u2018reads\u2019 portions of the internet to maintain an awareness of domain events.\nThe monitoring that such infrastructure performs will depend on a system of prompts and a system that manages the summaries and assessments that are the outputs of such prompts.", "This federal organisation provides brand, values, certification of quality, monetisation, financial stability, enabling infrastructure, training and, of course, general strategy. The atomic teams provide adaptability, fast decision making, audience and competitive awareness and, of course, routine production of valued content via AI-augmented workflows.\nImplementing such a federalised organisational structure would clearly be challenging for many news organisations, not least because of that eternal and vaguely-defined bugbear of newsroom change management: culture.", "This includes prompt design, assembly, evaluation and testing, \u2018certification\u2019, metadata, storage and retrieval, versioning, iterative improvement, usage tracking, analytics, output editing, training and more. Even just prompt design can involve explicit task definition, application of system roles and \u2018custom instructions\u2019, development of few-shot examples, management of context size, prompt templating, multi-prompt staging and more.\nJust evaluating the outputs of prompts applied to stochastic models fed by diverse source documents presents a combinatorial editing challenge unlike anything previously seen in news work. All of this requires infrastructure \u2013 databases, tools, user interfaces, schemas, integration, processes, analytics, training and documentation.\nInterfaces between prompts and journalistic tasks\nAssuming that adequate \u2018prompt-to-publish\u2019 infrastructure is in place, a newsroom still requires an interface between this infrastructure and its journalists.", "Producing 5, 10 or 20 different variants of every story, suitable for a wide variety of audiences, situations and consumption contexts, might be far easier than actually serving each of those variants to the right user at the right time. This is a personalisation challenge, but one that is quite different from the usual interpretation of \u2018personalisation\u2019 in most newsrooms \u2013 which tends to focus almost exclusively on personalised recommendations of one-size-fits-all content artefacts.\nThis new requirement is, instead, for personalisation of the story experience, and it therefore requires infrastructure that can store, select and serve different variants of a story to different users or different user segments in different situations \u2013 in addition to continuing to recommend relevant stories.", "What will journalism look like, for example, in an environment in which text, audio and video is fluid and malleable to the preferences of each individual consumer? What should the tangible output of a newsroom be in an environment in which that output is consumed primarily by machines? How will a coherent record of news \u2013 an archived \u2018first draft of history\u2019 \u2013 be maintained in such an environment? What might news become when useful reporting can be done on almost every word of text or speech, or every byte of data, produced in public by society? How will newsrooms capture value from their work in such an environment? What will that work be?\nThese questions, and others that are similarly fundamental, may not become relevant for years, or even decades, but merely participating meaningfully in that discussion will require newsrooms to possess far more tangible expertise of AI-augmented journalism than any now possess.", "Efficiency-focused strategies\nThe most obvious opportunities for applying generative AI to news are in bringing new efficiencies to specific and familiar steps within the existing news production workflows supporting an organisation\u2019s existing news products. This \u2018more-efficient-production-of-existing-products\u2019 strategy is attractive in its simplicity, but its benefits will almost certainly be short-lived because it assumes that the existing media environment will continue in roughly its existing form.\nIt is increasingly possible that the competitive environment, product offerings, production workflows and business models of news organisations will change, possibly radically, as use of generative AI becomes ubiquitous and as AI-based media products appear.", "A relatively low risk category of generative AI projects is purely back-end applications. These are applications with no direct audience-facing output, not even draft text, but which instead deliver their value to journalists or to businesses. These can include efficiency-focused or quality-focused tasks such as tagging, other kinds of categorisation, headline and SEO suggestions, assembly of newsletters from pre-existing copy, copy-editing, brainstorming and ideation, early research, some analysis, etcetera.\nIn addition to being relatively low risk, back-end AI applications are also relatively easy to implement as they are often \u2018loosely coupled\u2019 to news production workflow and infrastructure. Such applications can sometimes be managed by stand-alone tools disconnected from the primary publishing stack of the organisation, operated by specialised staff separate from the main editorial workflow.\nLanguage task projects", "Such a strategy would likely be research-led, would require substantial capital investment and needs to be justified by expected returns from high-value subscriptions. Such \u2018techno-editorial\u2019 businesses may not be well suited for reach-based news products but might nevertheless become significant components of an information ecosystem in which generative AI is ubiquitously deployed.\nTraining your own model\nAs news organisations look for strategic responses to generative AI, there are also a few options that are often discussed but which might be less attractive than they first seem. One of those \u2018approach-with-caution\u2019 strategies is that of pre-training a proprietary language model using a newsroom\u2019s archive.", "The advantage of this strategy is that it offers a way to compete within an emerging AI-mediated news ecosystem while continuing to exploit the advantages that news organisations already possess \u2014 brand, trust in editorial processes, habit, etcetera.\nFurthermore, that competition need not merely be aimed at existing targeted audiences but might now also be extended to entirely new audiences via new journalistic products that would have been editorially impossible without generative AI. Even small newsrooms now have the option of offering comprehensive multi-media news products to diverse audiences with radically different consumption behaviours and preferences.\nDifferentiation strategies\nA more enduring strategy for news in the age of AI will necessarily be centred on differentiation and competitive advantage, offering exclusive news products that remain uniquely valuable to audiences even as the information ecosystem changes.", "This kind of strategy might include provision of highly technical solutions such the systematic extraction of news events (and, critically, of news stories) from enormous streams of natural language text and speech, the creation and maintenance of proprietary datasets in story form, the systematic certification of that news, new tools for exploring and contextualising complex news, the extreme customization of news and of the experience of consuming news, etc.\nSuch processes and tools might resemble those used by government intelligence organisations, platforms like search engines, or processes and tools already offered by news organisations targeting financial professionals, but with much broader coverage and audience appeal.", "This attention is necessary and valuable, but it is not enough. Journalism must also engage with these new tools, explore them and their potential, and learn how to pragmatically apply them in creating and delivering value to audiences.\nThere are no best practices, textbooks or shortcuts for this yet, only engaging, doing and learning until a viable way forward appears. Caution is advisable, but waiting for complete clarity is not. So-called \u2018second mover advantage\u2019 is only available to those who are well-prepared to move when the time comes.\nThe next information ecosystem\nLooking further ahead, the need for hands-on familiarity with applied AI in journalism becomes even more critical because of the likelihood that the entire information ecosystem within which journalism exists will undergo transformation.", "Mitigating the risks associated with knowledge tasks requires editing processes designed to detect error and inappropriate content \u2013 non-trivial tasks, as evidenced by the difficulties experienced by CNET in publishing knowledge-based content from language models. Nonetheless, there are clearly many significant journalistic opportunities available from knowledge tasks, and these opportunities will likely increase as we collectively learn more about how to manage and edit their output and as we begin to use AI to help do that.\nAs with language tasks, knowledge tasks can be integrated into workflows in different ways and can contribute to different strategies. They too are a fundamental category of journalistic task in an AI-enabled newsroom.\nMedium-to-medium transformation projects", "That control will be exercised through prompts. Whether back-end tasks, language tasks or knowledge tasks, and whether employed as part of an efficiency strategy, a product expansion strategy or a product differentiation strategy, all applications of generative AI in newsrooms are fundamentally dependent not just on the models used to execute them, but also on the prompts used to direct those models.\nPermanent, professional mastery of prompts does not look like journalists casually cutting-and-pasting from a dozen options in a Google Doc into ChatGPT, but instead looks like a professional \u2018prompt-to-publish\u2019 pipeline that enables systematic and quality-controlled management of every aspect of prompting, outputs, editing and deployment.", "Language tasks can be done using any form of model access, such as the ChatGPT user interface, custom-built API-driven tools or even as new features integrated into content authoring and management systems. Language tasks can also be part of any strategy, including strategies based on efficiency, on new products or on differentiation. They are a fundamental category of journalistic task in an AI-enabled newsroom.\nKnowledge task projects\nA higher risk category of generative AI projects are applications that produce draft text with information content that originates in the language model itself, rather than from a source document.\nThese applications perform so-called \u2018knowledge tasks\u2019, because they are doing more than merely modifying language \u2013 they are true \u2018authoring\u2019 applications of language models."], "title": "AI and journalism: What's next? - Reuters Institute for the Study of ..."}}}
