There are countless challenges and opportunities facing society that journalists can and should be prepared to communicate with the general public, but in many cases, that will not be possible without artificial intelligence (AI).\n[4]: In early July, the Associated Press made a deal with OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, to license \u201cpart of AP\u2019s text archive\u201d and get access to \u201cOpenAI\u2019s technology and product expertise.\u201d A few days later, OpenAI announced a $5 million grant, accompanied by $5 million in software use \u201ccredits,\u201d to the American Journalism Project, an organization that supports nonprofit newsrooms. Meanwhile, Google has reportedly been presenting major news organizations, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, with a new software \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d for journalists, code-named Genesis, which promises to \u201ctake in information \u2014 details of current events, for example \u2014 and generate news content,\u201d with a pitch described by some in attendance as unsettling\n[5]: By Molly Killeen | Euractiv Est. 4min 03-12-2021 (updated: 06-12-2021 ) From automated reporting and data processing to information verification, AI\u2019s presence in the world of journalism is growing.

According to an article by Jeremy Gilbert, Knight Chair in digital media strategy at Northwestern University, AI is crucial for addressing the challenges and opportunities facing society today. This sentiment is shared by many in the industry, with the entire news industry asking themselves \"what's next?\" after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. In fact, the Associated Press has made a deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to access their technology and expertise. Other major news organizations, such as Google, are also exploring the use of AI in news production.\n\nHowever, this integration of AI in journalism also brings up ethical concerns. As highlighted in an article by Euractiv, the media industry's reliance on trust and truth adds a layer of complexity to the use of AI. There are concerns about algorithmic bias and the potential amplification of misinformation. To address these issues, many news organizations are exploring solutions such as transparent algorithms, human-AI collaboration, and robust fact-checking processes.\n\nAn investigation into the ethical dilemmas of AI in journalism integration should also include case studies. For example, in an article by the American Journalism Project, they discuss the potential for AI to generate news content and the ethical concerns surrounding this practice. They also mention successful integration of AI in breaking down and standardizing COVID-19 data. This highlights the potential benefits of AI in journalism, but also the importance of responsible use.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of AI in journalism is a complex and evolving issue.

One year later, dozens of influential, global newsrooms had formal documents related to the use of AI.\nIn between, artificial intelligence research firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot that can produce all sorts of written material when prompted: lines of code, plays, essays, jokes and news-style stories. Elon Musk and Sam Altman founded OpenAI in 2015, with multibillion dollar investments over the years from Microsoft.\nNewsrooms including USA Today, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Financial Times have since developed AI guidelines or policies \u2014 a wave of recognition that AI chatbots could fundamentally change the way journalists do their work and how the public thinks about journalism.\n[5]: The rise of generative AI in journalism has provided a powerful tool for creating news content but also raises complex ethical questions around transparency, bias, and the role of human journalists.\nI will immediately come clean: The above sentence was written by AI chatbot ChatGPT, when asked for a one-sentence introduction to this article about the ethics of using such tools in journalism.\nDoes this mean I should give the chatbot a joint byline?

The most common use of AI was for the production of content, with nearly 70% or respondents saying they had used it for this purpose. The next most popular uses were information gathering, multimedia content production and business tasks. Despite its popularity, the AP found that people working in the news industry have significant concerns about generative AI and their employers have implemented precautions unevenly.\nThe AP\u2019s Generative AI in Journalism study surveyed professionals in the news industry about how they are using AI in their work and what the practical and ethical implications are for these technologies. The AP received 292 responses to its survey, which was conducted at the end of 2023, representing a range of roles in the industry.\n[2]: The rise of generative AI in journalism has provided a powerful tool for creating news content but also raises complex ethical questions around transparency, bias, and the role of human journalists.\nI will immediately come clean: The above sentence was written by AI chatbot ChatGPT, when asked for a one-sentence introduction to this article about the ethics of using such tools in journalism.\nDoes this mean I should give the chatbot a joint byline?

These technology tools can generate content that\u2019s skewed or misleading (Generative AI Working Group, n.d.). They\u2019ve been shown to produce images and text that perpetuate biases related to gender, race (Nicoletti & Bass, 2023), political affiliation (Heikkil\u00e4, 2023), and more. As generative AI becomes further ingrained into higher education, it\u2019s important to be intentional about how we navigate its complexities.\nBiased Content\nProblems with bias in AI systems predate generative AI tools. For example, in the Gender Shades project, Buolamwini (2017) tested AI-based commercial gender classification systems and found significant disparities in accuracy across different genders and skin types. These systems performed better on male and lighter-skinned faces than others. The largest disparity was found in darker-skinned females, where error rates were notably high.\n[4]: Blue Planet Studio - stock.adobe\n6 steps in fact-checking AI-generated content\nGenerative AI tools are now prevalent, yet the extent of their accuracy isn't always clear. Users should question an AI's outputs and verify them before accepting them as fact.\nInformation disseminated online is increasingly created with the help of artificial intelligence, but such tools are far from perfect.\nEarlier in 2024, Google Chrome users reported the search engine's AI overview provided them with misleading information -- such as telling them to use glue to keep cheese from sliding off pizza and eat one rock per day. This is known as an AI hallucination.\n[5]: AI and journalism: What's next?\nInnovation in journalism is back.

The technical limitations of AI tools in journalism can contribute to ethical concerns, such as bias or inaccuracy in reporting.\n\nAccording to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, AI is being used in newsrooms worldwide to automate mundane tasks, deliver personalized content, and provide insights that help journalists understand the stories they're covering on a deeper level. However, as with any technology, there are limitations to what AI can do. AI-powered tools can only analyze and report based on the data they are given, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy if the data is skewed or incomplete.\n\nOne major concern is the risk of AI-generated content, where AI is used to write news articles or produce videos without human intervention. While this may improve efficiency and reduce costs, it also raises questions about the authenticity and credibility of the content. Without human judgment and fact-checking, AI-generated content may perpetuate biases and spread misinformation.\n\nAnother ethical dilemma is the dilution of human judgment in editorial decisions. As AI tools are used to select and prioritize news stories, there is a risk of human editors losing control over what is deemed newsworthy. This could lead to a lack of diversity in news coverage and the promotion of sensationalized or biased content.\n\nTransparency is also a key concern. As AI tools become more advanced, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between human and AI-generated content. This lack of transparency can erode trust in journalism and raise questions about the motivations behind news production.\n\nTo address these ethical dilemmas, news organizations are establishing guidelines and frameworks for responsible AI use. For example, the Google News Initiative supports JournalismAI, a global initiative that works with journalists, AI developers, and ethicists to develop best practices for integrating AI in journalism.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI has the potential to improve newsroom efficiency and productivity, it also raises important ethical concerns. Journalists, news organizations, and consumers must be aware of the technical limitations of AI tools and work towards responsible and transparent integration to maintain the essential values of journalism.

However, there are also some valid concerns surrounding AI technology:\n- Will AI be a threat to humanity? For that AI first needs to surpass human intelligence. Experts do not expect that to happen in the next 30-40 years.\n- Will AI be a threat to our jobs? Yes, 44% of low education workers will be at risk of technological unemployment by 2030.\n- Can we trust the judgment of AI systems? Not yet, AI technology may inherit human biases due to biases in training data\nIn this article, we focus on AI bias and will answer all important questions regarding biases in artificial intelligence algorithms from types and examples of AI biases to removing those biases from AI algorithms.\nWhat is AI bias?\n[2]: As a step toward improving our ability to identify and manage the harmful effects of bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommend widening the scope of where we look for the source of these biases \u2014 beyond the machine learning processes and data used to train AI software to the broader societal factors that influence how technology is developed.\nThe recommendation is a core message of a revised NIST publication, Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence (NIST Special Publication 1270), which reflects public comments the agency received on its draft version released last summer. As part of a larger effort to support the development of trustworthy and responsible AI, the document offers guidance connected to the AI Risk Management Framework that NIST is developing.\n[3]: The rise of generative AI in journalism has provided a powerful tool for creating news content but also raises complex ethical questions around transparency, bias, and the role of human journalists.\nI will immediately come clean: The above sentence was written by AI chatbot ChatGPT, when asked for a one-sentence introduction to this article about the ethics of using such tools in journalism.\nDoes this mean I should give the chatbot a joint byline?

Well, here at NPR, it's reporters, producers, editors, literally hundreds of human beings in our newsroom. And until recently, it was pretty safe to assume that real people were behind the bylines and the articles that you read. But last year, an investigation by the publication Futurism found that Sports Illustrated had been publishing AI-written pieces by make-believe journalists. It was a scandal that rocked the publication, and, shortly after, the magazine's publisher fired the CEO.\n[2]: Editor\u2019s Note: Since publication of this report, NewsGuard has identified hundreds of additional unreliable, AI-generated websites. Visit our AI Tracking Center for the latest total number and for our latest coverage.\nBy McKenzie Sadeghi and Lorenzo Arvanitis | Published on May 1, 2023\nArtificial intelligence tools are now being used to populate so-called content farms, referring to low-quality websites around the world that churn out vast amounts of clickbait articles to optimize advertising revenue, NewsGuard found.\nIn April 2023, NewsGuard identified 49 websites spanning seven languages \u2014 Chinese, Czech, English, French, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Thai \u2014 that appear to be entirely or mostly generated by artificial intelligence language models designed to mimic human communication \u2014 here in the form of what appear to be typical news websites.\n[3]: AI and journalism: What's next?\nInnovation in journalism is back. Following a peak of activity in the mid 2010s, the idea of fundamentally reinventing how news might be produced and consumed had gradually become less fashionable, giving way to incrementalism, shallow rhetoric and in some cases even unapologetic \u2018innovation exhaustion.\u2019 No longer. The public release of ChatGPT in late November of 2022 demonstrated capabilities with such obvious and profound potential impact for journalism that AI-driven innovation is now the urgent focus of the senior leadership teams in almost every newsroom. The entire news industry is asking itself \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019?\n[4]: The rise of generative AI in journalism has provided a powerful tool for creating news content but also raises complex ethical questions around transparency, bias, and the role of human journalists.\nI will immediately come clean: The above sentence was written by AI chatbot ChatGPT, when asked for a one-sentence introduction to this article about the ethics of using such tools in journalism.\nDoes this mean I should give the chatbot a joint byline?

For example, NPR recently reported on an investigation by Futurism that revealed Sports Illustrated had been publishing AI-written articles by fake journalists. This scandal resulted in the firing of the magazine's CEO and raised questions about the transparency and accountability of AI-generated content.\n\nAdditionally, NewsGuard has identified hundreds of unreliable, AI-generated websites that are used for clickbait and profit. These websites are often created using artificial intelligence language models and pose a threat to the credibility of journalism as a whole.\n\nAs AI tools become more prevalent in newsrooms, the question of what's next for the industry has become a pressing issue. According to Nieman Reports, there is a renewed focus on AI-driven innovation in journalism, with many news organizations looking for ways to use AI without compromising journalistic values.\n\nHowever, the rise of AI in journalism has also raised complex ethical questions. The use of generative AI in news production blurs the lines between human and machine, leading to debates over transparency and the role of human journalists. As one article asks, should AI chatbots be given joint bylines for their contributions to news articles?\n\nIn conclusion, news organizations are taking steps to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI in journalism.

One of the main concerns is the potential erosion of journalistic integrity, as AI tools are adopted to improve newsroom efficiency and productivity. This raises questions about the dilution of human judgment in editorial decisions and the risks of AI-generated content.\nAccording to the research conducted by the Associated Press, the use of AI in newsrooms is on the rise. From automated reporting and data processing to information verification, AI is being incorporated into various aspects of news production. However, with trust in media already in a precarious position, there are concerns that the use of AI could worsen the situation.\nOne of the main ethical dilemmas in AI-journalism integration is the potential for AI-generated content to perpetuate biases or inaccuracies. This can lead to reputational harm for both the news organization and the individuals or groups being portrayed. This highlights the importance of responsible AI use and the need for guidelines and frameworks to ensure ethical practices are upheld.\nTo understand the boundaries between AI-driven efficiency and the preservation of journalistic values, interviews with ethicists, AI developers, journalists, and media consumers should be conducted. Additionally, examining case studies where AI initiatives have either succeeded or failed in maintaining ethical standards would provide valuable insights for best practices.\nIn conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize the news industry, its integration must be carefully monitored to prevent compromising core ethical principles. With responsible use and proper guidelines, AI can enhance journalistic practices without sacrificing integrity.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-A7pIXaCH0YY1bbsyArrn2Sp6xJYR8", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "produce the question.

Following a peak of activity in the mid 2010s, the idea of fundamentally reinventing how news might be produced and consumed had gradually become less fashionable, giving way to incrementalism, shallow rhetoric and in some cases even unapologetic \u2018innovation exhaustion.\u2019 No longer. The public release of ChatGPT in late November of 2022 demonstrated capabilities with such obvious and profound potential impact for journalism that AI-driven innovation is now the urgent focus of the senior leadership teams in almost every newsroom. The entire news industry is asking itself \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019?\nThis article is based on a distillation of what I have learned from these conversations. It assumes a knowledge of generative AI\u2019s general capabilities and potential, and examines some of the ways that large news organisations are thinking about its strategic and practical implications for their newsrooms. My intent here is to help advance the conversation beyond awareness and towards specific initiatives that can help move newsrooms forward in preparing for an uncertain AI-mediated future.\nAny point of view regarding the application of AI to news is somewhat speculative, especially given the remarkable pace of advancement in AI functionality. Nonetheless, I believe that some clarity may be emerging.\nGiven this uncertainty, it may be useful for news organisations to reexamine their technical architectures and infrastructure strategy from the perspective of an increasing need for flexibility. This might involve reexamining build-vs-buy decisions, refactoring brittle, tightly coupled architectures, or even attempting to identify various possible product scenarios and a path to infrastructure that could support those scenarios if they develop.\nAny such reevaluation should consider the many new options for AI-enabled software architectures and AI-enabled software engineering that are appearing. The increasing need for flexible infrastructure is accompanied by new AI-enabled techniques that may make it easier to design, build and maintain such infrastructure.\n4. Organisational structure for AI-empowered teams\nNews organisations will need to operate differently\nInfrastructure is also required to take advantage of opportunities to use LLMs to substantially scale news-gathering by monitoring and analysing large volumes of source documents \u2013 perhaps as part of a differentiation strategy focused on competitively defensible coverage of a particular news domain.\nA starting point is infrastructure that enables constant access to source material, which might exist in different text formats, or in audio or video form that must first be converted to text transcripts using AI speech-to-text tools, or possibly even in large datasets that are frequently updated. Such \u2018monitoring\u2019 infrastructure might range from a simple list of sources to a complex web crawler that continually \u2018reads\u2019 portions of the internet to maintain an awareness of domain events.\nThe monitoring that such infrastructure performs will depend on a system of prompts and a system that manages the summaries and assessments that are the outputs of such prompts.\nThis federal organisation provides brand, values, certification of quality, monetisation, financial stability, enabling infrastructure, training and, of course, general strategy. The atomic teams provide adaptability, fast decision making, audience and competitive awareness and, of course, routine production of valued content via AI-augmented workflows.\nImplementing such a federalised organisational structure would clearly be challenging for many news organisations, not least because of that eternal and vaguely-defined bugbear of newsroom change management: culture.\nThis includes prompt design, assembly, evaluation and testing, \u2018certification\u2019, metadata, storage and retrieval, versioning, iterative improvement, usage tracking, analytics, output editing, training and more. Even just prompt design can involve explicit task definition, application of system roles and \u2018custom instructions\u2019, development of few-shot examples, management of context size, prompt templating, multi-prompt staging and more.\nJust evaluating the outputs of prompts applied to stochastic models fed by diverse source documents presents a combinatorial editing challenge unlike anything previously seen in news work. All of this requires infrastructure \u2013 databases, tools, user interfaces, schemas, integration, processes, analytics, training and documentation.\nInterfaces between prompts and journalistic tasks\nAssuming that adequate \u2018prompt-to-publish\u2019 infrastructure is in place, a newsroom still requires an interface between this infrastructure and its journalists.\nProducing 5, 10 or 20 different variants of every story, suitable for a wide variety of audiences, situations and consumption contexts, might be far easier than actually serving each of those variants to the right user at the right time. This is a personalisation challenge, but one that is quite different from the usual interpretation of \u2018personalisation\u2019 in most newsrooms \u2013 which tends to focus almost exclusively on personalised recommendations of one-size-fits-all content artefacts.\nThis new requirement is, instead, for personalisation of the story experience, and it therefore requires infrastructure that can store, select and serve different variants of a story to different users or different user segments in different situations \u2013 in addition to continuing to recommend relevant stories.\nWhat will journalism look like, for example, in an environment in which text, audio and video is fluid and malleable to the preferences of each individual consumer? What should the tangible output of a newsroom be in an environment in which that output is consumed primarily by machines? How will a coherent record of news \u2013 an archived \u2018first draft of history\u2019 \u2013 be maintained in such an environment? What might news become when useful reporting can be done on almost every word of text or speech, or every byte of data, produced in public by society? How will newsrooms capture value from their work in such an environment? What will that work be?\nThese questions, and others that are similarly fundamental, may not become relevant for years, or even decades, but merely participating meaningfully in that discussion will require newsrooms to possess far more tangible expertise of AI-augmented journalism than any now possess.\nEfficiency-focused strategies\nThe most obvious opportunities for applying generative AI to news are in bringing new efficiencies to specific and familiar steps within the existing news production workflows supporting an organisation\u2019s existing news products. This \u2018more-efficient-production-of-existing-products\u2019 strategy is attractive in its simplicity, but its benefits will almost certainly be short-lived because it assumes that the existing media environment will continue in roughly its existing form.\nIt is increasingly possible that the competitive environment, product offerings, production workflows and business models of news organisations will change, possibly radically, as use of generative AI becomes ubiquitous and as AI-based media products appear.\nA relatively low risk category of generative AI projects is purely back-end applications. These are applications with no direct audience-facing output, not even draft text, but which instead deliver their value to journalists or to businesses. These can include efficiency-focused or quality-focused tasks such as tagging, other kinds of categorisation, headline and SEO suggestions, assembly of newsletters from pre-existing copy, copy-editing, brainstorming and ideation, early research, some analysis, etcetera.\nIn addition to being relatively low risk, back-end AI applications are also relatively easy to implement as they are often \u2018loosely coupled\u2019 to news production workflow and infrastructure. Such applications can sometimes be managed by stand-alone tools disconnected from the primary publishing stack of the organisation, operated by specialised staff separate from the main editorial workflow.\nLanguage task projects\nSuch a strategy would likely be research-led, would require substantial capital investment and needs to be justified by expected returns from high-value subscriptions. Such \u2018techno-editorial\u2019 businesses may not be well suited for reach-based news products but might nevertheless become significant components of an information ecosystem in which generative AI is ubiquitously deployed.\nTraining your own model\nAs news organisations look for strategic responses to generative AI, there are also a few options that are often discussed but which might be less attractive than they first seem. One of those \u2018approach-with-caution\u2019 strategies is that of pre-training a proprietary language model using a newsroom\u2019s archive.\nThe advantage of this strategy is that it offers a way to compete within an emerging AI-mediated news ecosystem while continuing to exploit the advantages that news organisations already possess \u2014 brand, trust in editorial processes, habit, etcetera.\nFurthermore, that competition need not merely be aimed at existing targeted audiences but might now also be extended to entirely new audiences via new journalistic products that would have been editorially impossible without generative AI. Even small newsrooms now have the option of offering comprehensive multi-media news products to diverse audiences with radically different consumption behaviours and preferences.\nDifferentiation strategies\nA more enduring strategy for news in the age of AI will necessarily be centred on differentiation and competitive advantage, offering exclusive news products that remain uniquely valuable to audiences even as the information ecosystem changes.\nThis kind of strategy might include provision of highly technical solutions such the systematic extraction of news events (and, critically, of news stories) from enormous streams of natural language text and speech, the creation and maintenance of proprietary datasets in story form, the systematic certification of that news, new tools for exploring and contextualising complex news, the extreme customization of news and of the experience of consuming news, etc.\nSuch processes and tools might resemble those used by government intelligence organisations, platforms like search engines, or processes and tools already offered by\n\nThe topic of the page:\n**Ethical Dilemmas in AI-Journalism Integration**\n\nThis storyline would delve into the ethical concerns that arise from the integration of AI in journalistic practices. As AI tools are adopted to improve newsroom efficiency and productivity, questions surface regarding the potential erosion of journalistic integrity. Key ethical dilemmas include the risks of AI-generated content, the dilution of human judgment in editorial decisions, and the transparency of AI's role in news production.\n\nAn in-depth investigation should involve interviews with ethicists, AI developers, journalists, and media consumers to gather perspectives on the boundaries between AI-driven efficiency and the preservation of essential journalistic values such as accuracy, independence, and accountability. Research should also explore existing guidelines and frameworks being established by news organizations to ensure responsible AI use, highlighting best practices and areas for improvement.\n\nConsideration should be given to scenarios where AI outputs exacerbate biases or inaccuracies, possibly leading to reputational harm. The investigation should thus focus on case studies where AI initiatives either succeeded in maintaining high journalistic standards or faltered, causing public outcry or ethical controversies.
