Still, concerns remain over the ethical implications of using this kind of software in a sector that deals with sensitive information and has a potentially wide societal reach. Despite this, the media is not included as a high-risk area of application in the EU\u2019s draft AI Act, which takes a vertical risk-based approach to regulating the technology\u2019s application, identifying sectors seen as particularly vulnerable to its misuse or unintended consequences. EU launches AI blueprint in bid to become world leader The European Commission has presented on Wednesday (21 April) a long-waiting \u2018AI package\u2019. The proposal is the first-ever attempt to regulate AI and has been developed as part of a broader ambition to make Europe a global leader in the field by being the first to set clear guidelines. AI in journalism is already broad in scope regarding both existing and potential applications", "By Molly Killeen | Euractiv Est. 4min 03-12-2021 (updated: 06-12-2021 ) From automated reporting and data processing to information verification, AI\u2019s presence in the world of journalism is growing. Shutterstock / metamorworks] Euractiv is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: BulgarianPrint Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram AI technologies are increasingly being incorporated into newsrooms, but with trust in media in a precarious position, concerns remain that introducing machine learning could worsen the situation. From automated reporting and data processing to information verification, AI\u2019s presence in the world of journalism, and other sectors, is growing. But the media industry\u2019s reliance on trust and truth means an added layer of complexity when it comes to using such tech. Several programmes successfully integrate AI into the news-making process, breaking down and standardising COVID-19 data", ".\u201d What is needed, therefore, he said, is an \u201cethics by design\u201d approach to creating these kinds of technologies. \u201cYou actually need ethical considerations everywhere \u2013 you need it while you construct or design the AI, you need it in constructing the data set, during training, and you need it when you apply it.\u201d When it comes to the deployment of this software by media organisations, an additional level of considerations arise, given the potential implications of publishing information that has been processed by automated technologies. AI tools can be invaluable for investigative journalists, for example, when it comes to collating and processing large volumes of information, said Jonathan Stray, an AI researcher at the University of Berkeley, speaking at the London School of Economics\u2019 JournalismAI Festival on Thursday (2 December)", ". In many cases, the work is still behind the scenes, automating the collection and processing of large volumes of data, for example, or using textual analysis to fact-check or tag articles. Increasingly, though, it is also being worked into more outward-facing components of journalism, including the formulation of articles themselves. Various newsrooms have deployed automation to issue updates and piece together articles on current affairs, sports events and property listings, amongst other topics. The software is not just text-based and is being applied to other forms of media. Design AI, a Munich-based company, working with news organisations such as the European Pressphoto Agency and Spanish news agency EFE, has developed AI for annotating videos, mainly for archiving footage but with potential applications in a wide range of practices both within and outside of journalism", ". When it comes to the ethics of using AI in the media and how to consider them, a differentiation needs to be made between the different levels of development, Keesiu Wong, CEO and co-founder of DesignAI told EURACTIV. This occurs first in determining whether the concern applies to AI as a whole, for instance, when it comes to bias in data, as seen in the technology\u2019s application in other sectors, or whether it applies to the software\u2019s media-specific use. Secondly, it occurs when working out where these issues might arise within the process of development to application. \u201cThere are different levels and places where undesired unethical behaviour might happen\u201d, Wong said. \u201cThis might be in how the software is programmed \u2013 this would be basically our concern \u2013 it might be how the data was constructed\u2026and this is basically the hardest one because it\u2019s the least obvious. And then it could also be in how the AI is applied", ". However, he added, before any claims or allegations are made public based on this, \u201cguaranteeing the accuracy of a process, guaranteeing human oversight of the quality of the product is one of the main ethical challenges relevant to AI and story production.\u201d EU Council presidency pitches significant changes to AI Act proposal The Slovenian Presidency circulated a compromise text on the EU\u2019s draft AI Act, including major changes in the areas of social scoring, biometric recognition systems, and high-risk applications, while also identifying future points for discussion.

When we encounter ethical challenges in our research and development, we make them a topic in order to raise awareness for such problems and make our own learning process transparent.\u201d\nOther news organisations are working behind the scenes to get themselves to a point where they are ready to make such a public statement of intent.", "In March tech magazine brand Wired was one of the first to publish the ground rules it set for its journalists on using generative AI, saying it wants \u201cto be on the front lines of new technology, but also to be ethical and appropriately circumspect\u201d.\nIt came shortly after tech news rival CNET was criticised for publishing AI-generated content (some of which was false) under a generic staff byline that did not make the production process clear. It has now updated its processes to be more transparent, although Beckett suggested publishers may not always need to tell their audiences when AI has assisted in creating a story.", "Wired told readers it has decided not to publish stories with text generated or edited by AI, whether it creates the full story or just parts, \u201cexcept when the fact that it\u2019s AI-generated is the whole point of the story\u201d. It said risks of the current AI tools available include the introduction of errors or bias, boring writing, and plagiarism. Therefore it decided: \u201cIf a writer uses it to create text for publication without a disclosure, we\u2019ll treat that as tantamount to plagiarism.\u201d\nWired journalists may, however, experiment with using AI to suggest headlines, text for social media posts, story ideas or help with research, but this will be acknowledged where appropriate and never lead to a final product without human intervention.", "Another risk is of introducing bias or discrimination into a story, but Beckett said this was common to any kind of AI work. He has noticed \u201cbigger ethical problems\u201d within other industries, he said, for example a discriminatory algorithm for allocating teacher contracts in Italy that resulted in people unfairly being out of work.\nBeckett added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly to be frightened of. I mean, there\u2019s plenty of risks inherent in the technology, like there is with lots of technology, but as long as you\u2019re cautious then you can avoid or minimise many of those risks.", "It warned that using any of its writing without telling readers would be \u201cmisleading\u2026 and could potentially compromise the ethical standards of journalism\u201d. And if I disclose it? Yes, but \u201cit is important to consider the limitations of using AI-generated content, as it may not always accurately reflect the nuances and complexities of human experience or the specific context of a particular news event.\n\u201cIt is also important to ensure that any AI-generated content used in your news story is factually accurate, free from biases and is in compliance with the ethical standards of journalism.\u201d\nEmail pged@pressgazette.co.uk to point out mistakes, provide story tips or send in a letter for publication on our \"Letters Page\" blog", "Heidi News, a French-language Swiss online media brand focusing on science and health, published its own \u201cethical charter\u201d on AI earlier this month.

No content will be published without prior human supervision.\u201d To provide transparency to readers, they said every article will continue to be \u201csigned\u201d by at least one journalist \u201cwho remain guarantors of the veracity and relevance of the information it contains\u201d.", "The BBC has been hiring into its responsible data and AI team, whose job it is to build \u201ca culture where everyone at the BBC is empowered to use data and AI/ML [machine learning] responsibly.

You\u2019re supposed to have bosses who look at your copy and you\u2019re supposed to correct things if they\u2019re not accurate. This is what we\u2019re supposed to do as journalists.\u201d\nBack to my interaction with ChatGPT. It itself appears very keen to mention \u201cethical standards of journalism\u201d in discussions of this topic, using that phrase in multiple responses to my questions.", "Professor Charlie Beckett, director of the Journalism AI project at LSE which produced a major report on this topic in 2019, told Press Gazette trust, accuracy, accountability and bias continue to be the major ethical issues around AI despite new issues raised by the advent of generative AI such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and image generator DALL-E, and Google\u2019s Bard. The conversation has rapidly evolved over the past six months as these new chatbots are so much more user-friendly than previous versions, increasing the possibilities of using them on a day-to-day basis.\nBeckett said the general consensus appears to be that newsrooms are \u201cquite rightly\u201d exploring the new generative AI technologies before they make big decisions about how they might or might not use them.", "After discovering that ChatGPT had cited to members of the public at least two supposed articles by its journalists that turned out to be fake, The Guardian has created a \u201cworking group and small engineering team to focus on learning about the technology, considering the public policy and IP questions around it, listening to academics and practitioners, talking to other organisations, consulting and training our staff, and exploring safely and responsibly how the technology performs when applied to journalistic use\u201d.\nThe Guardian\u2019s head of editorial innovation Chris Moran has said the title will publish a \u201cclear and concise explanation of how we plan to employ generative AI\u201d in the coming weeks, ensuring it maintains the \u201chighest journalistic standards\u201d and stays accountable to the audience.", "Dutch news agency ANP has its own guidelines, in which it similarly said AI tools could be used to provide inspiration to its journalists but that it would not use any AI-produced information without human verification.\nAnd German news agency DPA published guidelines specifically addressing the ethical implications and need for transparency: \u201cDPA only uses legitimate AI that complies with applicable law and statutory provisions and meets our ethical principles, such as human autonomy, fairness and democratic values.\n\u201cDPA uses AI that is technically robust and secure to minimise the risk of errors and misuse. Where content is generated exclusively by AI, we make this transparent and explainable. A person is always responsible for all content generated with AI.\u201d", "He said news organisations should consider it in terms of what they currently do: for example, if they tell readers when copy comes directly from the PA wire, or if they make clear when they follow-up a story from another outlet. Alternatively, they may want to tell readers they \u201cused a clever AI programme to do this as a way of showing off\u201d or as part of the storytelling on a big investigation.\nBut he added: \u201cYou certainly shouldn\u2019t deceive the user. You shouldn\u2019t say this is written by Charlotte Tobitt and in fact it was written by an algorithm. If you\u2019re going to tell people be honest. Don\u2019t say with AI assistance or something, just say, yeah, this is automated news, we review it, make sure the standards are there, but this is automated\u2026 I don\u2019t want to sound complacent at all, but I think it\u2019s largely common sense.\u201d", "And Insider\u2019s editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson wrote to staff last week in a memo published by Semafor reporter Max Tani. Carlson said Insider journalists should not use any generative AI tools to write any sentences for publication \u2013 but this may change in the future after a pilot group of experienced editorial staff have carried out some experimentation.\nCarlson gave three initial warnings about generative AI for those in the pilot group: that it can create falsehoods, that it plagiarises by presenting other people\u2019s text as its own, and that its text can be \u201cdull and generic\u201d. \u201cMake sure you stand by and are proud of what you file,\u201d he wrote.\nA lot of focus has gone on the potential pitfalls of AI-written content. But Beckett pointed out: \u201cJournalism has always been fallible. It\u2019s often done in a rush and often journalism has to be updated and corrected, and more context given\u2026 So I think before we start getting too pious, we have to check our own human flaws.\u201d", "\u201cI think that\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just suddenly say \u2018okay, we\u2019re going to ban using generative AI in our newsroom\u2019 or \u2018immediately from today we\u2019re going to tell our readers everything\u2019. I think it is good to pause and reflect.\u201d\nIn some ways, he said, media organisations \u201cdon\u2019t have to change anything\u2026 depending on what you\u2019re doing with it. In some senses, you just have to stick to your values. So whatever your values were before, keep with them. If you don\u2019t have any then good luck, but if you do have them then obviously it\u2019s just a question of thinking practically about how it applies in this case\u201d.\nSeveral news organisations have already published guidelines on their use of AI tools for the production of content, while others are currently at the stage of running taskforces in part to decide what rules need to be set.", "The rise of generative AI in journalism has provided a powerful tool for creating news content but also raises complex ethical questions around transparency, bias, and the role of human journalists.\nI will immediately come clean: The above sentence was written by AI chatbot ChatGPT, when asked for a one-sentence introduction to this article about the ethics of using such tools in journalism.\nDoes this mean I should give the chatbot a joint byline?

The \u2018natural language understanding\u2019 (NLU) abilities of LLMs can not only read, but interpret, evaluate, analyse, synthesise and summarise.\nFurthermore, they can do this not just with natural language text and speech, but also with structured data \u2014 as clearly demonstrated by OpenAI\u2019s new \u2018code interpreter\u2019 add-on to their GPT-4 LLM, and likely soon with visual information in images and video. Projects based on NLU and \u2018reporting at scale\u2019 are already underway at newsrooms, including small newsrooms. Such projects may be most appropriate for a differentiation strategy and might enable newsrooms to build out and defend special abilities to report systematically on specific domains.\nAdvanced projects", "Infrastructure is also required to take advantage of opportunities to use LLMs to substantially scale news-gathering by monitoring and analysing large volumes of source documents \u2013 perhaps as part of a differentiation strategy focused on competitively defensible coverage of a particular news domain.\nA starting point is infrastructure that enables constant access to source material, which might exist in different text formats, or in audio or video form that must first be converted to text transcripts using AI speech-to-text tools, or possibly even in large datasets that are frequently updated. Such \u2018monitoring\u2019 infrastructure might range from a simple list of sources to a complex web crawler that continually \u2018reads\u2019 portions of the internet to maintain an awareness of domain events.\nThe monitoring that such infrastructure performs will depend on a system of prompts and a system that manages the summaries and assessments that are the outputs of such prompts.", "The increased risk associated with knowledge task projects comes from the significant potential for hallucinations, simple error from training data, biases, out-of-date context and other limitations inherent in language models.\nNonetheless, if these risks can be managed, knowledge tasks offer a substantial range of news products including provision of context for stories, explainer-like background content, different interpretations of events based on historical context, and even full articles, especially on evergreen, commodity subject matter.", "Given this uncertainty, it may be useful for news organisations to reexamine their technical architectures and infrastructure strategy from the perspective of an increasing need for flexibility. This might involve reexamining build-vs-buy decisions, refactoring brittle, tightly coupled architectures, or even attempting to identify various possible product scenarios and a path to infrastructure that could support those scenarios if they develop.\nAny such reevaluation should consider the many new options for AI-enabled software architectures and AI-enabled software engineering that are appearing. The increasing need for flexible infrastructure is accompanied by new AI-enabled techniques that may make it easier to design, build and maintain such infrastructure.\n4. Organisational structure for AI-empowered teams\nNews organisations will need to operate differently", "This federal organisation provides brand, values, certification of quality, monetisation, financial stability, enabling infrastructure, training and, of course, general strategy. The atomic teams provide adaptability, fast decision making, audience and competitive awareness and, of course, routine production of valued content via AI-augmented workflows.\nImplementing such a federalised organisational structure would clearly be challenging for many news organisations, not least because of that eternal and vaguely-defined bugbear of newsroom change management: culture.", "This includes prompt design, assembly, evaluation and testing, \u2018certification\u2019, metadata, storage and retrieval, versioning, iterative improvement, usage tracking, analytics, output editing, training and more. Even just prompt design can involve explicit task definition, application of system roles and \u2018custom instructions\u2019, development of few-shot examples, management of context size, prompt templating, multi-prompt staging and more.\nJust evaluating the outputs of prompts applied to stochastic models fed by diverse source documents presents a combinatorial editing challenge unlike anything previously seen in news work. All of this requires infrastructure \u2013 databases, tools, user interfaces, schemas, integration, processes, analytics, training and documentation.\nInterfaces between prompts and journalistic tasks\nAssuming that adequate \u2018prompt-to-publish\u2019 infrastructure is in place, a newsroom still requires an interface between this infrastructure and its journalists.", "A similar but even more ambitious potential strategy, probably available only to a few well-resourced news organisations or well-funded start-ups, is to seek to develop proprietary or competitively defensible information technologies and services centred on news \u2013 products that might resemble specialised intelligence tools more than traditional news products.\nThis option, which we might call a \u2018techno-editorial product\u2019 strategy, would likely reverse the relationship between the product and editorial functions that currently exists in most news organisations, requiring editorial operations to support product and business development rather than the other way around.", "The advantage of this strategy is that it offers a way to compete within an emerging AI-mediated news ecosystem while continuing to exploit the advantages that news organisations already possess \u2014 brand, trust in editorial processes, habit, etcetera.\nFurthermore, that competition need not merely be aimed at existing targeted audiences but might now also be extended to entirely new audiences via new journalistic products that would have been editorially impossible without generative AI. Even small newsrooms now have the option of offering comprehensive multi-media news products to diverse audiences with radically different consumption behaviours and preferences.\nDifferentiation strategies\nA more enduring strategy for news in the age of AI will necessarily be centred on differentiation and competitive advantage, offering exclusive news products that remain uniquely valuable to audiences even as the information ecosystem changes.", "Regardless of where a news organisation might be in its path towards a strategy for responding to AI, there is an urgent strategic need that requires early attention \u2013 that of communicating the organisation\u2019s approach to AI to stakeholders, funders, staff and audiences.\nThe urgency of strategic communication about AI for news organisations comes from the awareness that every individual connected with the organisation already has about the abilities of these tools and their potential for dramatic disruption. Most people in the news industry are already playing with the tools, reading the reports, assessing the potential and asking the obvious questions.\nIt would, of course, be ideal to patiently assess the situation, carefully devise a strategy, produce a plan for executing that strategy, and then communicate that strategy and plan \u2013 but that may not be possible to do quickly.", "A second near frontier is the advent of LLM \u2018agents\u2019, pioneered by small examples like AutoGPT and BabyAGI. These approaches use LLMs to deconstruct high-level tasks expressed in vague terms into small, specific, actionable tasks that are then carried out by the LLM. They offer intriguing possibilities for automating some investigative journalism, and for scaling investigative reporting into an ongoing and systematic function.\nThe AI strategies and specific AI projects described here illustrate that newsrooms have tangible and specific options for moving forward towards an AI-mediated information ecosystem, but these strategies and projects are insufficient. Producing professional AI-enabled news products, using AI-enabled workflows, at sufficient scale to make a difference, day-after-day and month-after-month, requires something more. It requires infrastructure.\n3. Infrastructure for an AI-ready newsroom\nOld-school AI infrastructure", "This article is based on a distillation of what I have learned from these conversations. It assumes a knowledge of generative AI\u2019s general capabilities and potential, and examines some of the ways that large news organisations are thinking about its strategic and practical implications for their newsrooms. My intent here is to help advance the conversation beyond awareness and towards specific initiatives that can help move newsrooms forward in preparing for an uncertain AI-mediated future.\nAny point of view regarding the application of AI to news is somewhat speculative, especially given the remarkable pace of advancement in AI functionality. Nonetheless, I believe that some clarity may be emerging.", "For many people in journalism the first half of 2023 was a time for asking questions and learning the basics of AI. What can ChatGPT actually do? What is generative AI? What is a language model? What is a \u2018prompt\u2019? How dependable are these tools? What kind of skills are required to use them? How fast is this technology improving? What are the risks? How much of all this is just hype?\nMany newsrooms went further, providing their employees and audiences with statements or guidelines describing how they intended to approach the use of generative AI in their workflows and news products. Some even began publishing a few experimental articles written by ChatGPT. Very few, however, have yet taken specific steps to pragmatically and routinely apply these technologies in their newsrooms. Change is in the air, but specific initiatives are harder to find.", "A more practical communication strategy at this stage might consist of acknowledging the situation, articulating how the organisation is engaging with and learning about AI, providing clear guidelines for its early or limited use, demonstrating new approaches to innovation, signalling adaptability and generally preparing for change. A tone of optimism and excitement for the potential of AI to help raise journalism above commodity information and to make it more accessible to many more people is also appropriate.\nA strategic path to continued relevance\nThe common objective for almost all news organisations in navigating the coming AI-induced transformation is, bluntly, continued relevance.\nNews organisations, whether funded by ads, subscriptions, public funds or philanthropy, will seek to remain sufficiently valuable to enough people to ensure that those funding mechanisms continue to function.", "Language tasks can be done using any form of model access, such as the ChatGPT user interface, custom-built API-driven tools or even as new features integrated into content authoring and management systems. Language tasks can also be part of any strategy, including strategies based on efficiency, on new products or on differentiation. They are a fundamental category of journalistic task in an AI-enabled newsroom.\nKnowledge task projects\nA higher risk category of generative AI projects are applications that produce draft text with information content that originates in the language model itself, rather than from a source document.\nThese applications perform so-called \u2018knowledge tasks\u2019, because they are doing more than merely modifying language \u2013 they are true \u2018authoring\u2019 applications of language models.", "- It is likely that technology will play a more central role in news organisations than it currently does. It is likely, perhaps less obviously, that the accessibility of generative AI will cause the use and control of technology to be dispersed throughout the organisation rather than concentrated within a team of specialists.\n- It is likely that news organisations will place a higher priority on adaptability and constant entrepreneurial innovation.\n- It is likely that substantial differences in the productivity of teams and individuals may appear, caused by differential effectiveness in using AI.\n- It is likely that, as competition for audience attention increases, news organisations will increasingly value a deep understanding of audiences and their information needs.\n- It is likely that, at least for some categories of news, news organisations will focus less on producing individual stories by hand and more on overseeing systems and processes that produce or help produce stories.", "Coming up with a list of things that your newsroom might be able to do using ChatGPT is fairly easy (Summarisation! Rewriting in a simpler style!). It is much harder to clearly identify exactly what it is that you are trying to achieve with generative AI, why you are trying to achieve it, how you might plausibly achieve it at scale in routine and professionally managed operations, and whether that achievement will even continue to be relevant as AI fundamentally alters the competitive landscape in the coming months and years.\nTo frame this discussion I will begin with an overview of potential strategies for using AI in news, before turning to options for the practical deployment of AI in newsrooms, and the infrastructural and organisational requirements needed to support those options. At the end of the piece I will offer a point of view for changes that we might anticipate for the news industry in the longer term.\n1. Applying generative AI to news: product and editorial strategies", "This attention is necessary and valuable, but it is not enough. Journalism must also engage with these new tools, explore them and their potential, and learn how to pragmatically apply them in creating and delivering value to audiences.\nThere are no best practices, textbooks or shortcuts for this yet, only engaging, doing and learning until a viable way forward appears. Caution is advisable, but waiting for complete clarity is not. So-called \u2018second mover advantage\u2019 is only available to those who are well-prepared to move when the time comes.\nThe next information ecosystem\nLooking further ahead, the need for hands-on familiarity with applied AI in journalism becomes even more critical because of the likelihood that the entire information ecosystem within which journalism exists will undergo transformation.", "A more ambitious but still relatively low risk category of generative AI projects include those applications that produce draft text by modifying source text in some way. These applications use language models solely for \u2018language tasks\u2019 and should not introduce any information content into the draft that was not already present in the source document.\nThey explicitly do not depend on the knowledge available to the model as a result of its training data, and they therefore reduce (but don\u2019t eliminate) the risks of hallucinations, biases and other issues.\nExamples of language tasks include summarisation, simplification, stylistic re-versioning, rewriting text for particular channels (social media, topic bulletins, etcetera), script-writing for audio or video, translation...", "Progress in the face of uncertainty depends on developing and maintaining options, but options require situational awareness, and situational awareness comes from authentic engagement with the environment. For journalism that environment will almost certainly be shaped by AI.\nIn this article I have attempted to describe a few ways in which news organisations might build on the awareness of AI that they have developed since the launch of ChatGPT with specific strategies, projects, infrastructure and organisational changes.\nThese suggestions are my own interpretation of what I am observing and hearing, and they are by no means exhaustive or complete. It would be reasonable to expect people who staff or lead news organisations to exhibit frustration or even resentment at the prospect of even more impending change, but this is not what I have observed.", "Producing 5, 10 or 20 different variants of every story, suitable for a wide variety of audiences, situations and consumption contexts, might be far easier than actually serving each of those variants to the right user at the right time. This is a personalisation challenge, but one that is quite different from the usual interpretation of \u2018personalisation\u2019 in most newsrooms \u2013 which tends to focus almost exclusively on personalised recommendations of one-size-fits-all content artefacts.\nThis new requirement is, instead, for personalisation of the story experience, and it therefore requires infrastructure that can store, select and serve different variants of a story to different users or different user segments in different situations \u2013 in addition to continuing to recommend relevant stories.", "Over the past six months I have had the privilege of spending significant time discussing AI with the senior leadership of more than 40 news organisations, ranging from scrappy digitally-native newsrooms in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America to many of the largest global news providers based in the US, UK, and Europe.\nThis access came as a result of my familiarity with AI-driven innovation in news, acquired from a combination of applied product innovation at large media companies in the US and UK, and from a small parallel academic career exploring the first principles of computation applied to news production and consumption.\nMy journey with many of the questions now facing news organisations began in Silicon Valley more than a decade ago, and my exploration of the GPT family of language models began in 2019 at the BBC. My career focus \u2014 a relative niche until the arrival of ChatGPT \u2014 was suddenly of great interest to many people in the news industry.", "Some potential barriers to implementing this category of projects include the need for an editorial producer with experience in the output medium to ensure quality, the not insignificant cost of using the specialised models, and the challenge of distributing the same story in several different media.\nListening and monitoring projects\nThe project categories described above all focus on novel ways of producing news products using AI, but practical projects focused on news-gathering are also viable using large language models.\nThe term \u2018generative AI\u2019 has an obvious built-in bias towards the generation of media, but large language models and multi-modal models can also read, listen and soon observe at enormous scale, enabling entirely new ways of reporting news.", "The challenge of the coming transition to an AI-mediated information ecosystem is therefore to navigate a path that takes advantage of near-term opportunities for efficiency, medium-term opportunities for new products and services for audiences, and longer-term opportunities for re-imagining what news can become in a transformed information ecosystem.\nThis path obviously comes with considerable associated risk, specifically the risk of losing existing value and of not being able to develop new value to replace it, and may therefore require a greater tolerance of risk by leaders in news organisations. Developing that greater tolerance for risk, a tolerance perhaps closer to that of the technology companies that initiated this transition, might be the most important strategic step that a news organisation can take.\n2. How to deploy generative AI in newsrooms\nFrom strategy to projects", "The collective organisational influence of all these assumptions can perhaps be summed up in a single word: autonomy. Those teams that adopt and master AI will be able to do much more, with many fewer dependencies on other parts of the organisation.\nAn AI-native news organisation\nThe enablement of increased autonomy by AI suggests to me that the productive units of AI-native news organisations might be small, AI-empowered, multi-disciplinary and self-directing teams operating relatively independently from each other and each focused on serving a specific audience or audience need.\nIn this scenario the organisation itself becomes somewhat federalised, providing an environment within which self-directing teams can be productive and impactful but not directing their work.", "A simple form of experience personalisation, being pursued by several newsrooms, is to set up a separate channel or even an entirely separate brand from which to serve a newsroom\u2019s stories in new AI-generated formats.\nA more advanced form is to offer direct user control over their consumption experience, for example in the way that the Artifact news app offers article consumption as summaries, simplified text, emoji stories, poems or as audio readings by celebrities (see illustration above).\nA more complex form of experience personalisation is to automatically adapt a user\u2019s experience using behavioural data and contextual signals.\nEach of these approaches can open up access to a newsroom\u2019s journalism to more people, but each also requires infrastructure that can support the management and serving of story variants.\nNews-gathering infrastructure", "In the decade prior to the rise of large language models, infrastructure for AI in news organisations meant something different than it does today. It meant data warehouses and data lakes, a well-structured and well-maintained metadata schema, libraries of embeddings, an expensive data science team, a large monthly AWS bill and a product roadmap focused on training small, specialised \u2018machine learning\u2019 models from scratch using small volumes of proprietary data.\nThese roadmaps often included business-focused models predicting propensity to subscribe, propensity to churn or willingness-to-pay, journalist-focused models enabling a host of special functions useful for a handful of special stories, and audience-focused models such as semantic search and, of course, different kinds of recommender systems.", "Any strategy for adapting a newsroom to an information ecosystem defined by generative AI is of little use without specific, practical projects that translate that strategy into useful outcomes.\nIdentifying such projects is obviously difficult during this current period of exceptionally rapid change, because of the considerable risks of wasted investments, embarrassing missteps or potential damage to brands or trust. In addition, projects can only contribute meaningfully towards a strategy if they can be applied in routine, day-to-day operations, rather than merely as testable prototypes or demonstrators.\nTo move forward, therefore, we need to identify categories of projects that might advance newsrooms towards an AI-ready future while minimising risks, and also identify the infrastructure requirements needed to deploy those projects routinely at scale when that time comes.\nBack-end projects", "The development of generative AI has placed journalism at the cusp of significant change, variously equated to the iPhone moment, the birth of the internet and even the appearance of the printing press.\nThe significance of the moment has been understood and appreciated by the senior leadership of most newsrooms, and many are already moving forward towards specific initiatives and experiments aimed at preparing for an AI-mediated future.\nConsiderable attention is rightly being given to potential harms, to the ethics of using AI in journalism, to influencing regulation and legislation, to the potential for AI-created misinformation and disinformation, to education of audiences and \u2018AI literacy\u2019 and to the development of early guidelines to orient news organisations as they begin this new transformation of their industry.", "A proprietary model built on the same transformer architecture as most current LLMs will still hallucinate, even if the entire training corpus is accurate, and a news organisation is unlikely to match the efforts underway by technology companies aimed at making language models more accurate. Training a proprietary language model may make sense for some very specific use cases in some news organisations with special information products (for example a \u2018text-plus-financial-data\u2019 multi-modal model at Bloomberg), but even in such cases a clear-eyed, careful consideration of the costs and benefits of such a strategy is essential.\nBuilding a chatbot for archives\nAnother \u2018approach-with-caution\u2019 strategy that some news organisations have pursued or considered is that of building a proprietary chatbot that enables conversational, interactive access to the organisation\u2019s current news and archive.", "This kind of AI infrastructure is still very valuable and useful, even if affordable only by a small number of elite news organisations, but it is very different from the infrastructure required to apply generative AI.\nProfessionalised prompt management\nA fundamental and permanent requirement for applying generative AI to news work is infrastructure that enables the professional development, testing and deployment of prompts.\nAI models will be a permanent part of the future of news, and controlling those models in the service of useful journalistic work will be a central function of editorial organisations.", "There are early indications of this in the nascent generative search experiences offered by Google and Microsoft, in the user control of consumption experiences offered by well-funded news aggregators such as Artifact (launched by the founders of Instagram), in the declared intention to build a foundation language model around \u2018X\u2019 (or Twitter 2.0), and even in the early behaviour of tens of millions of early adopters of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, who have quickly learned how to use traditional media essentially as raw material for their own self-directed consumption experiences.\nA \u2018more-efficient-production-of-existing-products\u2019 strategy is clearly a reasonable place to start, but it does not fundamentally compete with new AI-enabled experiences and therefore may not remain sufficient for long.\nProduct expansion strategies", "Instead the predominant tone of my conversations about AI has been one of optimism and excitement, largely at the opportunity presented by AI to further realise an ideal of journalism that motivates many of us who work in and around newsrooms. If you could bring that ideal to life, without regard for the scarcity of resources, where would you start?\nDavid Caswell is a consultant, builder and researcher focused on AI in news. David has led news product innovation at the BBC, Tribune Publishing & Yahoo! and publish peer-reviewed work. He is a regular speaker of our newsroom leadership programmes. This piece, which was written entirely by hand and without the use of AI, was first published here.\nIn every email we send you'll find original reporting, evidence-based insights, online seminars and readings curated from 100s of sources - all in 5 minutes.\n- Twice a week\n- More than 20,000 people receive it\n- Unsubscribe any time", "This \u2018unique products\u2019 strategy is challenging because it will be audiences that decide on the relative uniqueness of a newsroom\u2019s products, not newsrooms. Pursuit of differentiation must therefore be clear-eyed, unsentimental and data-tested \u2013 magical thinking about vague specialness requiring little effort to implement is unlikely to be helpful here. A differentiation strategy might still potentially fit well with some of the values and brand attributes of traditional journalism, especially if the information ecosystem begins to significantly degrade under the onslaught of AI-generated content.", "A relatively low risk category of generative AI projects is purely back-end applications. These are applications with no direct audience-facing output, not even draft text, but which instead deliver their value to journalists or to businesses. These can include efficiency-focused or quality-focused tasks such as tagging, other kinds of categorisation, headline and SEO suggestions, assembly of newsletters from pre-existing copy, copy-editing, brainstorming and ideation, early research, some analysis, etcetera.\nIn addition to being relatively low risk, back-end AI applications are also relatively easy to implement as they are often \u2018loosely coupled\u2019 to news production workflow and infrastructure. Such applications can sometimes be managed by stand-alone tools disconnected from the primary publishing stack of the organisation, operated by specialised staff separate from the main editorial workflow.\nLanguage task projects", "A news organisation with a coherent, well-articulated strategy for responding to generative AI, delivered via a portfolio of well-conceived applications supported by a professionalised prompt management process and delivered to audiences via a personalised publishing stack would clearly be well-placed to adapt to an AI-mediated information environment.\nBut such an organisation would also likely need to operate differently from a traditional digital news publisher, and its organisational structure would probably need to change substantially in order to support those differences. Furthermore, the skills and talent required to operate successfully in this environment are likely to also be different.\nDiscussions of likely changes in the structure of news organisations often focus on the potential for AI to either replace or augment traditional jobs. But the reality is likely to be more complicated than that.", "What will journalism look like, for example, in an environment in which text, audio and video is fluid and malleable to the preferences of each individual consumer? What should the tangible output of a newsroom be in an environment in which that output is consumed primarily by machines? How will a coherent record of news \u2013 an archived \u2018first draft of history\u2019 \u2013 be maintained in such an environment? What might news become when useful reporting can be done on almost every word of text or speech, or every byte of data, produced in public by society? How will newsrooms capture value from their work in such an environment? What will that work be?\nThese questions, and others that are similarly fundamental, may not become relevant for years, or even decades, but merely participating meaningfully in that discussion will require newsrooms to possess far more tangible expertise of AI-augmented journalism than any now possess.", "It is quite certain that many newsroom tasks will be either replaced or made moot by AI, but it is also certain that many new tasks will appear. It is obviously difficult at this stage to predict how old and new tasks will be assembled into individual jobs, teams and department-level functions, and different newsrooms with different strategies will clearly do this differently. Nonetheless we can make some informed speculation using the likely drivers of organisation change as a starting point.\nDrivers of organisational change\nIf we consider what generative AI can do, how it is being used for news applications in a nascent way and how news organisations talk about it, then we can make some plausible assumptions about how news organisations might change in response to it:", "A particularly ambitious category of generative AI projects for news are applications that transform information content from one information medium into another, for example from text into audio, from text into video or from text into graphical images.\nUnlike language tasks and knowledge tasks, these applications typically depend on special-purpose medium-to-medium transformation models, often used in combination with general-purpose large language models within complex workflows.\nSuch special-purpose models include speech-to-text models (transcription), text-to-speech models (synthetic voices), text-to-video models (synthetic avatars, automated generation of B-roll video, etcetera), text-to-image models and others. These tools are still at an early stage. But they are developing very quickly, are widely available, and already easily match human quality in many cases.", "How editorial judgement is exercised, however, may change in ways that require substantial new skills and different talents. These might include an ability to work with abstractions and systems, to analytically understand audiences and their needs, to engage with complexity, and to remain curious and to learn continually.\nOrganisations will obviously need to identify, support, incentivise and retain their most innovative and adaptable employees, but they will also need to supply those AI-empowered employees with leadership that is perhaps more entrepreneurial, more skilled at motivating and coaching, and perhaps less managerial or political.\nSpecific technical skills with specific AI tools or models may, surprisingly, be less important due to the near-universal accessibility of the interfaces. Merely operating AI will likely be much easier and therefore less valuable than wielding it skilfully as a genuine superpower.\n5. So, what\u2019s next?\nThe AI moment", "Mitigating the risks associated with knowledge tasks requires editing processes designed to detect error and inappropriate content \u2013 non-trivial tasks, as evidenced by the difficulties experienced by CNET in publishing knowledge-based content from language models. Nonetheless, there are clearly many significant journalistic opportunities available from knowledge tasks, and these opportunities will likely increase as we collectively learn more about how to manage and edit their output and as we begin to use AI to help do that.\nAs with language tasks, knowledge tasks can be integrated into workflows in different ways and can contribute to different strategies. They too are a fundamental category of journalistic task in an AI-enabled newsroom.\nMedium-to-medium transformation projects", "That control will be exercised through prompts. Whether back-end tasks, language tasks or knowledge tasks, and whether employed as part of an efficiency strategy, a product expansion strategy or a product differentiation strategy, all applications of generative AI in newsrooms are fundamentally dependent not just on the models used to execute them, but also on the prompts used to direct those models.\nPermanent, professional mastery of prompts does not look like journalists casually cutting-and-pasting from a dozen options in a Google Doc into ChatGPT, but instead looks like a professional \u2018prompt-to-publish\u2019 pipeline that enables systematic and quality-controlled management of every aspect of prompting, outputs, editing and deployment.", "Furthermore, the potential of this category of applications is likely to increase with the imminent arrival of so-called \u2018multi-modal\u2019 functionality enabling richly descriptive image-to-text, video-to-text and other transformations.\nExamples of potentially high-value journalistic tasks that can be accomplished using these cross-media models include the automated or semi-automated creation of text articles from audio or video source material, the creation of audio and video news products from text articles, the transformation of text articles into graphical stories or videos, and the automated or semi-automated creation of podcasts from articles.\nThese tasks are most useful for a product expansion strategy. They can often be achieved using just model vendor user interfaces and so have the potential to enable relatively low-resource newsrooms to quickly offer multimedia content at significant scale.", "Some examples of familiar forms might include: proprietary news gathering using special access or special skills; audience trust gained from well-demonstrated verification and validation processes; richly contextual content produced from archives or from deep familiarity with subject matter; or perhaps a commitment to systematic coverage of particular subject domains using narrowly customised stories, such as local coverage or climate reporting.\nAll these opportunities, however, will likely need to be comprehensively optimised using generative AI to remain competitive within an AI-mediated information ecosystem, even if their core value is differentiated. Developing forms of differentiation will likely be very challenging for many news organisations, especially for those whose current product is largely built on packaging commodity information, however there may eventually be no alternative.\nTechno-editorial strategies", "For many journalists this is unlikely to be the raw prompt, which for useful tasks will likely be long, quite complex and probably \u2018certified\u2019 as tested and reliable according to some accepted quality control process. Instead most journalists will likely access prompts via buttons and controls that produce draft outputs for editing and refinement.\nSuch interface infrastructure could consist of either stand-alone journalistic \u2018co-pilot\u2019 tools with separate experiences for prompt management and prompt use \u2013 something already seen in Google\u2019s \u2018Genesis\u2019 interface, in various \u2018News AI\u2019 tools from start-ups and in some in-house tools developed by newsrooms. It will also require a comprehensive integration into an organisation\u2019s existing content management infrastructure or possibly even as an entirely new form of CMS designed specifically for AI workflows.", "Efficiency-focused strategies\nThe most obvious opportunities for applying generative AI to news are in bringing new efficiencies to specific and familiar steps within the existing news production workflows supporting an organisation\u2019s existing news products. This \u2018more-efficient-production-of-existing-products\u2019 strategy is attractive in its simplicity, but its benefits will almost certainly be short-lived because it assumes that the existing media environment will continue in roughly its existing form.\nIt is increasingly possible that the competitive environment, product offerings, production workflows and business models of news organisations will change, possibly radically, as use of generative AI becomes ubiquitous and as AI-based media products appear.", "Such a strategy would likely be research-led, would require substantial capital investment and needs to be justified by expected returns from high-value subscriptions. Such \u2018techno-editorial\u2019 businesses may not be well suited for reach-based news products but might nevertheless become significant components of an information ecosystem in which generative AI is ubiquitously deployed.\nTraining your own model\nAs news organisations look for strategic responses to generative AI, there are also a few options that are often discussed but which might be less attractive than they first seem. One of those \u2018approach-with-caution\u2019 strategies is that of pre-training a proprietary language model using a newsroom\u2019s archive.", "This lack of success might be at least partly due to the relative inadequacy of news and news archives as a dataset powering such an interface, which for news organisations will be considerably smaller and more homogenous than the vast datasets that power ChatGPT or even search for that matter.\nFurthermore, from a technology perspective it is very difficult to replicate the fluid nature of communication with an LLM using the techniques currently available for constructing chatbots from archives, which typically involve some kind of embedding-based search operation combined with interpretation of the results by the language model.\nThe result is often either far too many \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 responses to specific queries, or references to \u2018closest match\u2019 archived articles in isolation from current context, an experience that can\u2019t compete with internet-enabled chatbots like Bing Chat or Perplexity.ai.\nCommunication strategy", "Maintaining control of these tools, of the buttons and functions they provide, and of the prompts behind those buttons will likely be critical for journalistic independence in an AI-mediated news ecosystem.\nInfrastructure for personalised experiences\nEven with a coherent strategy, a set of applications that support that strategy and a prompt management process that professionalises the execution of those applications, the extent of AI-enabled news production will still be limited by the available content management, serving and distribution infrastructure.\nThis is especially true of a product expansion strategy executed using language tasks or medium-to-medium transformations.", "This option seems attractive given the success of ChatGPT. However, when considering a news chatbot, it is important to separately consider the interface component (i.e. interactive chat), the information component (e.g. news and its context) and the underlying technology used to deliver the experience (e.g. LLMs).\nDespite the rapid adoption of ChatGPT, text or verbal chat as an interface is still very far from broadly accepted as a way of accessing any kind of information, much less news. Audience analytics for news bulletins built for voice agents like Amazon Alexa and Google Home have been disappointing, and early attempts at LLM-enabled chatbots by media companies have delivered little traffic.", "This all requires databases, data schemas, access tools and filtering functionality. Such functionality can be built at a small scale and used as a supplement to a manual monitoring workflow, and several newsrooms are already doing so.\nInfrastructure flexibility\nDespite our efforts to identify a useful way forward amid the uncertainty of the present moment, there remains a real possibility that AI might enable an entirely new interface to journalism, delivering experiences of news that are not centred on discrete text, audio or video artefacts.\nWe see early signs of this in the form of chat interfaces, generative search and early conversational voice interfaces enabled by language models. Despite the caution provided above regarding an archive chatbot strategy, and despite evidence from audience research indicating a preference for passive rather than active news consumption, it is still possible that we may soon be interacting with news in entirely new ways.", "This kind of strategy might include provision of highly technical solutions such the systematic extraction of news events (and, critically, of news stories) from enormous streams of natural language text and speech, the creation and maintenance of proprietary datasets in story form, the systematic certification of that news, new tools for exploring and contextualising complex news, the extreme customization of news and of the experience of consuming news, etc.\nSuch processes and tools might resemble those used by government intelligence organisations, platforms like search engines, or processes and tools already offered by news organisations targeting financial professionals, but with much broader coverage and audience appeal.", "A practical, near-term response being explored by some pioneering newsrooms is the possibility of becoming a \u2018two-speed organisation\u2019, taking advantage of the new autonomy available from AI to set up teams that are loosely coupled to existing workflows. A longer-term response, already underway at several newsrooms, is to re-evaluate hiring and performance criteria to emphasise the skills and talents needed to form a more autonomous AI-empowered culture.\nSkills and talent\nThe most valued skill in an AI-empowered news organisation will likely be the same as it has been in traditionally configured news organisations.\nEditorial judgement \u2013 the ability to maintain a keen awareness of the deep informational needs of an audience or society, identify stories that meet those deep needs, verify and contextualise those stories, and then communicate them to audiences in clear and engaging forms \u2013 will probably remain the foundation of journalism.", "A more ambitious AI strategy for news organisations lies in reimagining and expanding the scope and scale of an organisation\u2019s news products in ways that only become feasible using generative AI. This \u2018new-products-for-new-audiences\u2019 strategy will likely be more enduring than an efficiency-only approach because it seeks to actively accommodate the expansion of audience choice that generative AI enables.\nIn essence this approach assumes that if generative AI is going to provide audiences with more control over their news consumption experiences (as pioneered by the Artifact app), then news organisations might as well offer that option directly. If news consumers can now control how they consume articles, then shouldn\u2019t they be able to do that on a news publisher\u2019s app or website?", "Our understanding of potential applications of AI in news is still nascent, not only because of the rapid development of new functionality but also because we have just begun to explore the potential of these tools for news work.\nThe projects described above are easily possible right now, with existing functionality, but there are also several \u2018near frontiers\u2019 of functionality that will likely open up significant new potential. One of these is the advent of multi-modal functionality, which is already available in limited forms in Bing Chat, MidJourney and soon GPT-4, and is likely to become increasingly powerful for applications that cross between language and visual information.", "This is likely a bad idea for most news organisations for multiple reasons, including the difficulty in attracting the world-class machine learning talent needed to create a useful language model, the tiny size of the archives of even the largest news organisations relative to the training needs of a useful language model, and the substantial costs of periodic retraining, maintaining and operating a proprietary language model in the face of rapidly improving technology.\nFurthermore there are few clear benefits available from training a proprietary model, even if it were competitive in performance to a commercial or open-source language model. Concerns about data security, vendor lock-in or a need for niche functionality can probably be addressed in much easier ways, including contractually, via abstraction of user interfaces, using model fine-tuning or using an open-source model."], "title": "AI and journalism: What's next? - Reuters Institute for the Study of ..."}, "https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/04/22/newsrooms-are-already-using-ai-but-ethical-considerations-are-uneven-ap-finds/": {"url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/04/22/newsrooms-are-already-using-ai-but-ethical-considerations-are-uneven-ap-finds/", "description": "The AP received 292 responses to its survey, which was conducted at the end of 2023, representing a range of roles in the industry.

Since then, Google, Meta, Microsoft and others have released their own generative AI products and many more began finding ways to integrate the technology into existing products. From the beginning, generative AI has demonstrated unreliable accuracy and a challenge to sourcing and attribution.\nThe AP found that people working in the news industry were aware of these concerns, but their organizations took uneven approaches to addressing them.", "Almost three quarters of people working in the news industry have used generative artificial intelligence (AI) in some professional capacity, according to a study by the Associated Press (AP). The most common use of AI was for the production of content, with nearly 70% or respondents saying they had used it for this purpose. The next most popular uses were information gathering, multimedia content production and business tasks. Despite its popularity, the AP found that people working in the news industry have significant concerns about generative AI and their employers have implemented precautions unevenly.\nThe AP\u2019s Generative AI in Journalism study surveyed professionals in the news industry about how they are using AI in their work and what the practical and ethical implications are for these technologies. The AP received 292 responses to its survey, which was conducted at the end of 2023, representing a range of roles in the industry.", "Some of the tasks that AI can perform for newsrooms offer extraordinary benefits with low risks to information accuracy. These include: transcribing long conversations, summarizing data and writing headlines. Other tasks that newsrooms are delegating to AI raise serious concerns, however. Information gathering, for instance, is a known weakness of chatbots, which commonly \u201challucinate\u201d falsehoods and present them as fact. Ultimately, only humans can go to the source and observe real world events. There is no digital replacement for boots-on-the-ground reporting.\nIn a white paper for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, Felix Simon suggested that this is a pivotal moment for journalism, but that AI need not be an existential threat if we are intentional about its implementation.", "The study found that news industry use of AI is common today, but many people aspire to use it more \u201cif it were capable of producing quality results.\u201d That\u2019s the language that was used in the survey and it\u2019s the question at the heart of the news industry\u2019s mixed feelings about the technology.\nGenerative AI works by analyzing patterns in large data sets and learning to generate new data with the patterns it observes in its source materials. In simpler terms, it learns from content (like text, images or videos) that humans created and then it makes new content that looks almost human-made. The fundamental problem with this process is that it is opaque and its inputs unknowable.", "According to Poynter\u2019s Kelly McBride, that\u2019s a problem.\n\u201cEvery single newsroom needs to adopt an ethics policy to guide the use of generative artificial intelligence,\u2019 McBride wrote in Poynter. \u201cBecause the only way to create ethical standards in an unlicensed profession is to do it shop by shop.\u201d\nMost large news organizations have now established their own set of principles for using AI, but that only scratches the surface of news sources on the internet. Poynter now provides a template for news outlets that want to get started.

With the help of AI, Microsoft has published false stories, posted offensive headlines and stoked election misinformation conspiracy theories.\nAs conflict roils several regions of the world today and dozens of consequential elections are scheduled to take place in the months ahead, the stakes for newsrooms will remain high.\n\u201cThe disruptive power of artificial intelligence will sweep through the information space this year at a time of intense political and economic volatility around the world,\u201d wrote Nic Newman for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism annual trends report. \u201cEmbracing the best of AI while managing its risks will be the underlying narrative of the year ahead.\u201d"], "title": "Newsrooms Are Already Using AI, But Ethical Considerations Are ... | Forbes"}, "https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/": {"url": "https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/", "description": "Generative AI systems can produce inaccurate and biased content for several reasons: ...

Content generated by AI tools like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard have been found to provide users with fabricated data that appears authentic. These inaccuracies are so common that they\u2019ve earned their own moniker; we refer to them as \u201challucinations\u201d (Generative AI Working Group, n.d.).\nFor an example of how AI hallucinations can play out in the real world, consider the legal case of Mata v. Avianca. In this case, a New York attorney representing a client\u2019s injury claim relied on ChatGPT to conduct his legal research. The federal judge overseeing the suit noted that the opinion contained internal citations and quotes that were nonexistent. Not only did the chatbot make them up, it even stipulated they were available in major legal databases (Weiser, 2023).\nAs we integrate AI into teaching and learning, it\u2019s important to be wary of its limitations.\nWhy is AI Flawed?", "Generative AI tools present similar problems. For example, a 2023 analysis of more than 5,000 images created with the generative AI tool Stable Diffusion found that it simultaneously amplifies both gender and racial stereotypes (Nicoletti & Bass, 2023). These generative AI biases can have real-world consequences. For instance, adding biased generative AI to \u201cvirtual sketch artist\u201d software used by police departments could \u201cput already over-targeted populations at an even increased risk of harm ranging from physical injury to unlawful imprisonment\u201d (Mok, 2023). There\u2019s also a risk that the veneer of objectivity that comes with technology tools could make people less willing to acknowledge the problem of biased outputs (Nicoletti & Bass, 2023). These issues aren\u2019t unique to image generators, either; researchers and users have found that text generators like ChatGPT may also produce harmful and biased content (Germain, 2023).\nInaccurate Content", "Generative AI systems can produce inaccurate and biased content for several reasons:\n- Training Data Sources: Generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of internet data. This data, while rich in information, contains both accurate and inaccurate content, as well as societal and cultural biases. Since these models mimic patterns in their training data without discerning truth, they can reproduce any falsehoods or biases present in that data (Weise & Metz, 2023).\n- Limitations of Generative Models: Generative AI models function like advanced autocomplete tools: They\u2019re designed to predict the next word or sequence based on observed patterns. Their goal is to generate plausible content, not to verify its truth. That means any accuracy in their outputs is often coincidental. As a result, they might produce content that sounds plausible but is inaccurate (O\u2019Brien, 2023).", "Unlike humans, AI systems do not have the ability to think or form beliefs. They operate algorithmically based on their training data, without any inherent capacity for reasoning or reflection. AI-generated content can sometimes stray off-topic or might include irrelevant information because deep learning models can produce outcomes that are seemingly coherent but lacking depth (Cano et al., 2023) Given this context, the human touch remains irreplaceable. Users must approach AI outputs with a critical eye and evaluate them with human judgement (Silberg & Manyika, 2019).\nDiversify Your Sources", "The world of higher education is rapidly embracing AI, and these new tools promise both opportunities and challenges. Generative AI offers great potential to improve how we teach, research, and operate. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that AI outputs can produce falsehoods and can amplify harmful biases. In short, while AI is a powerful tool, the human touch remains crucial. By working together, we can make the most of what AI offers while mitigating its known limitations.\nReferences\nBuolamwini, J.

Double-checking AI outputs against credible sources can prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation.\nThere are multiple steps involved in fact-checking AI-generated content, including the following:\n1. Research key points to separate fact from fiction", "Even if the content generator appears to have provided well-written and accurate information, users should be conscientious of false information. Make a list of key points in the AI's response and fact-check each one using credible sources. This includes the following information:\n- Names and titles.\n- Quotations.\n- Company names.\n- Any numbers -- including dates, statistics and ages.\n- Sequence of events.\nThis is worth the time and effort, as predicating an entire article on information that turns out to be wrong can be detrimental to readers and compromise the writer's credibility.\n2. Examine the plausibility of suspicious claims", "Keep an eye out for outlandish claims in AI-generated text and audio outputs, as well as visual elements in images and videos that seem out of place. While verifying each claim or image an AI tool produces is important, if something immediately stands out as implausible, users might want to think about discontinuing use of that tool. For example, if a tool asserts there are a billion people living in any given European country and attempts to back it up with fabricated claims, a human can determine the tool is unreliable without research.\n3. Validate AI outputs in depth using multiple sources\nSources used to train the AI tool data sets likely won't be quoted directly in the AI's outputs. Since it might be hard to pinpoint the original sources, similar sources can be used to verify the information. And multiple sources are encouraged, including the following:\n- Authoritative websites -- including well-known news outlets and organizations.\n- Research studies.\n- Academic journals.", "After all the facts have been verified by human fact-checkers, proofread the document. Like humans, AI systems can also misspell words, and use bad grammar and confusing wording. While using tools such as Grammarly can help in the process, humans should review it, too.\nDrawing conclusions about AI content generators\nAfter following these steps, content creators and readers can draw conclusions about whether an AI content generator or website relying on AI-generated content is credible.\nIn a reader's case, they might determine false AI-generated content has compromised a particular website's credibility if much of the information is incorrect or biased. Content creators who used a faulty AI tool to generate content and spotted many problems could either move forward with the AI tool with an abundance of caution or rule it out entirely and move to a new tool.

However, it is not as easy as it sounds.\nA naive approach is removing protected classes (such as sex or race) from data and deleting the labels that make the algorithm biased. Yet, this approach may not work because removed labels may affect the understanding of the model and your results\u2019 accuracy may get worse.\nSo there are no quick fixes to removing all biases but there are high level recommendations from consultants like McKinsey highlighting the best practices of AI bias minimization:\nSteps to fixing bias in AI systems:\n- Fathom the algorithm and data to assess where the risk of unfairness is high. For instance:", "- Follow a multidisciplinary approach. Research and development are key to minimizing the bias in data sets and algorithms. Eliminating bias is a multidisciplinary strategy that consists of ethicists, social scientists, and experts who best understand the nuances of each application area in the process. Therefore, companies should seek to include such experts in their AI projects.\n- Diversify your organisation. Diversity in the AI community eases the identification of biases. People that first notice bias issues are mostly users who are from that specific minority community. Therefore, maintaining a diverse AI team can help you mitigate unwanted AI biases.\nA data-centric approach to AI development can also help minimize bias in AI systems.\nTools to reduce bias\nTo prevent AI bias, companies can benefit from these technologies and tools:\nAI governance tools", "Technically, yes.

AI can be as good as data and people are the ones who create data. There are numerous human biases and ongoing identification of new biases is increasing the total number constantly. Therefore, it may not be possible to have a completely unbiased human mind so does AI system. After all, humans are creating the biased data while humans and human-made algorithms are checking the data to identify and remove biases.\nWhat we can do about AI bias is to minimize it by testing data and algorithms and developing AI systems with responsible AI principles in mind.", "- Examine the training dataset for whether it is representative and large enough to prevent common biases such as sampling bias.\n- Conduct subpopulation analysis that involves calculating model metrics for specific groups in the dataset. This can help determine if the model performance is identical across subpopulations.\n- Monitor the model over time against biases. The outcome of ML algorithms can change as they learn or as training data changes.\n- Establish a debiasing strategy within your overall AI strategy that contains a portfolio of technical, operational and organizational actions:\n- Technical strategy involves tools that can help you identify potential sources of bias and reveal the traits in the data that affects the accuracy of the model\n- Operational strategies include improving data collection processes using internal \u201cred teams\u201d and third party auditors.

The German media industry has voiced strong opinions on the matter; however, there is ongoing debate about whether readers care about AI-generated content. Discussions from #DGS2023 suggest that most people do not notice whether AI was used to create content. While many companies using AI prefer using disclaimers on AI-generated articles, Arist von Harpe offers an interesting perspective:", "Contextual understanding is equally vital to maintain coherent conversations, with chatbots needing to remember and reference prior messages to provide relevant responses. Personalisation presents another challenge, balancing the provision of personalised responses based on user data with privacy concerns and data protection regulations.\nHandling unexpected and ambiguous queries further tests chatbots\u2019 adaptability. It must respond to unexpected user inputs, asking clarifying questions or indicating limitations when necessary. Additionally, it has to maintain support for multiple languages, which are complex and require accurate translations and context-aware responses.", "AI-generated visuals can be quickly produced and personalised in marketing, enhancing advertisement campaign relevance and audience engagement. The images generated by AI offer opportunities for creative storytelling, with real-time visuals enhancing narratives and audience engagement.\nOne of the cornerstone applications of AI in a newsroom is the transcription of audio interviews or discussions into written content. This transformation is crucial as it facilitates the archival and easier dissemination of information. For instance, journalists often engage in verbal discussions or interviews, which are rich in content. Leveraging AI-driven transcription services, these verbal exchanges can be swiftly converted into text. This makes the content readily available for editing, publishing, or sharing across different platforms, enhancing the newsroom\u2019s ability to repurpose or reference past content.", "By integrating AI-powered audio transcription, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech technologies, newsrooms can significantly enhance their efficiency, accuracy, and content quality. This amalgamation streamlines workflow, helping newsrooms meet the demands of digital media. Additionally, AI aids in the creation and distribution of multimedia content, leading to a more informed and engaged audience. Through these technological advancements, newsrooms are better equipped to deliver high-quality content across various platforms to wider audiences.", "Ensuring secure integration with backend systems is important, preventing data leakage or security vulnerabilities.

AI is being used in newsrooms across the globe to automate mundane tasks, deliver personalised content, and provide insights that help journalists understand the stories they\u2019re covering on a deeper level. Let\u2019s look at the way news organisations are taking advantage of AI-driven solutions to enhance their reporting capabilities and reinvent the way news is produced and delivered to you.\nA quick recap on what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is and the way it is used in newsrooms\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that focuses on the development of systems that can accomplish tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence. It is now being increasingly used in the newsroom to automate mundane tasks, such as data collection, content curation, and sentiment analysis.", "Another way AI is being used in newsrooms is to streamline routine tasks, such as fact-checking and fact-gathering. This gives journalists more time to focus on the stories and angles that are most important to their audience. Automated fact-checking algorithms are being used to identify false claims and verify the accuracy of statements made by public figures.\nAdditionally, AI-driven sentiment analysis is being used to identify public sentiment around a given issue, helping journalists understand public opinion on a topic. The New York Times uses AI to provide tailored article recommendations to readers, based on their reading habits and interests. This helps draw readers in and keeps them coming back for more.\nChallenges posed by AI in the industry", "AI is changing the way news is gathered, reported, and shared with the world, and newsrooms have increasingly turned to AI-driven solutions to help them enhance their stories and AI\u2019s presence in newsrooms has started to raise a host of ethical and practical challenges.\nOne of the main reasons given is that AI algorithms are vulnerable to bias. As AI-driven solutions become more widely used, there is a risk that news organisations will inadvertently reproduce existing biases in their stories. For example, an AI-driven system might recommend stories based on the preferences of a few select individuals, thus marginalising certain voices or perspectives. Journalists must be aware of these risks and take steps to avoid them.", "Overall, AI is transforming the way that news is gathered, reported, and shared with the world. However, there are challenges to need to be overcome, such as the potential for bias and the need to ensure that AI-driven solutions are ethical and trustworthy.\nHow the BBC, the Guardian and the New York Times use AI\nOne of the most prominent examples of AI in newsrooms is the use of automated data collection and analysis. Automated data collection is used to aggregate large amounts of data from various sources, and then use artificial intelligence models to analyse it and extract valuable insights.\nFor example, the BBC News Labs is using AI to look for patterns in data from social networks and news sources, to help their journalists find stories and angles they might not have otherwise noticed. Similarly, The Guardian is using AI to identify stories in their vast archives that are making a comeback, or that are newly relevant."], "title": "AI in the newsroom: Benefits and challenges | Medium"}, "https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251917136/ai-generated-articles-are-permeating-major-news-publications": {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251917136/ai-generated-articles-are-permeating-major-news-publications", "description": "Reporter Maggie Harrison Dupre broke that story, and she has kept digging since, finding that AI-written content has made its way into many more publications, including the LA Times, the Miami ...", "snippets": ["What we discovered in our reporting was that AdVon was, in many cases, bylining or attributing authorship to fake writers, in many cases with fake, AI-generated faces.

And some of these AI-written reviews have some pretty strange mistakes in them. Like, you found some reviews they generated for weightlifting belts. Tell us about that (laughter).\nHARRISON DUPRE: Yeah. So the weightlifting belts were a great example. You know, you want to go to the gym. You want to protect your back.

It has a large number of publishers in the U.S. It ranges from big regional newspapers - for example, the LA Times or the Miami Herald - to a lot of smaller regional publishers around the U.S. - The Raleigh News & Observer, for example - you know, a midsize city paper - to just a lot of small newspapers. USA Today is another big AdVon contractor, as well as, of course, Sports Illustrated previously. Yeah, its reach is quite vast.\nCHANG: So when you contacted AdVon, what did they say to you about all of this?\nHARRISON DUPRE: AdVon's story evolved over time.

While these advancements hold the promise of greater efficiency and innovation, they also introduce complex ethical challenges, particularly concerning bias and misinformation. This article delves deep into the profound impact of AI on journalism ethics, addressing the nuances of these challenges and proposing potential solutions that safeguard the integrity of news reporting.\nThe Rise of AI in Journalism\nTransforming News Gathering and Analysis", "3. What steps can news organizations take to mitigate bias in AI algorithms? Collaboration between news organizations and AI developers is vital, ensuring diverse datasets, continuous oversight, and ongoing adjustments to algorithms to counter bias.\n4. Can AI eradicate misinformation entirely from news media? While AI can significantly aid in detecting and countering misinformation, complete eradication requires a holistic approach involving technological advancements and societal awareness.\n5. How can readers critically engage with news influenced by AI? Readers should stay informed about the role of AI in journalism, cross-reference information, and rely on reputable and trusted news sources for accurate reporting.", "Rather than being seen as a replacement, AI should be viewed as a collaborative tool that complements human journalistic expertise. AI can assist in data analysis, identifying trends, and even generating preliminary drafts. However, human journalists play a pivotal role in contextualizing information, exercising ethical judgment, and ensuring that the final output aligns with journalistic standards.\nFact-Checking and Verification\nAddressing misinformation requires a multifaceted approach that leverages AI\u2019s strengths in information processing. AI can aid journalists in fact-checking and verifying information quickly and efficiently. Automated cross-referencing and verification processes can help prevent the dissemination of false or misleading information, bolstering the credibility of news content.\nConclusion", "Artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era of news gathering and analysis, revolutionizing how journalists access and process information. The vast amount of data generated daily across digital platforms can overwhelm human capabilities. However, AI algorithms possess the power to swiftly sift through this data, identifying patterns, trends, and relevant stories. This capability empowers journalists with insights that can significantly enhance the depth and breadth of their reporting.\nAutomated Content Creation\nThe advent of AI-driven content creation tools has been a game-changer for newsrooms. These tools have the potential to streamline the news production process by generating articles, summaries, and even reports. The time-consuming task of writing routine news pieces can be automated, freeing up journalists to focus on more intricate aspects of their work. Nonetheless, concerns arise regarding the quality, authenticity, and credibility of content produced by AI.", "Threats to Journalistic Integrity\nAs AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated, concerns arise about its potential to blur the line between human-written and machine-generated news. Maintaining journalistic integrity and transparency becomes challenging when readers cannot distinguish between content authored by journalists and content produced by algorithms. The credibility of news organizations and the role of journalists in upholding the truth are put to the test.\nAddressing Ethical Concerns\nTransparent Algorithms\nThe imperative to address bias and uphold ethical standards necessitates transparency in AI algorithms. Developers should provide clear explanations of the data sources, methodologies, and decision-making processes employed by AI systems. Transparent algorithms enable independent audits and accountability, fostering a sense of trust among journalists and readers alike.\nHuman-AI Collaboration", "Ethical Challenges in AI-Driven Journalism\nBias in Algorithms\nAt the heart of the integration of AI in journalism lies a formidable ethical challenge: algorithmic bias. AI systems learn from historical data, and if this data contains inherent biases, those biases can be perpetuated by the algorithms. The result is the potential for skewed news coverage that reinforces stereotypes and inaccuracies. Recognizing and addressing algorithmic bias is crucial to maintaining journalistic integrity and delivering unbiased news to the public.\nMisinformation Amplification\nThe speed and scale at which AI processes and disseminates information can inadvertently amplify misinformation. False or misleading news stories can spread rapidly before their accuracy can be verified, undermining the core principles of responsible journalism. This phenomenon demands a careful examination of the role AI plays in the spread of misinformation and the measures necessary to mitigate its impact.", "The integration of AI into journalism is a double-edged sword, offering both immense opportunities and ethical challenges. While AI has the potential to elevate news production and delivery, the issues of bias and misinformation must be confronted head-on. By fostering transparent algorithms, promoting human-AI collaboration, and investing in robust fact-checking mechanisms, the journalism industry can harness AI\u2019s potential while preserving its commitment to accuracy and integrity.\nFAQs\n1. Can AI completely replace human journalists? No, AI is best viewed as a tool that enhances journalistic capabilities, but human oversight and ethical judgment remain essential for maintaining the quality of news reporting.\n2.

To take it one step further, those answers will also need to be tailored based on who it is that is asking the question. If a 35-year-old asks their smart speaker for information about George Floyd, the answer should be different than if a 9-year-old asks the same question. We\u2019re moving toward a different paradigm of storytelling, and it's one that can only be achieved with AI.", "We are taking steps toward all three of these areas simultaneously. We're seeing new tools for improved data gathering, and larger news organizations have done some amazing work in creating formulas and then building dashboards to help reporters identify interesting stories. Those same organizations are also beginning to play with more personalization of content. When I was at the Washington Post, we were proud to make small strides in each of those efforts.", "2. News experiences need to be more personalizedToday, news organizations are able to learn much more about their readers than basic demographics.

Here are three areas where I think there can be the greatest impact.", "1. Reporters need better toolsThe world reporters work in today looks very different than it did a generation ago. Beyond the obvious technological advances, journalists are awash in data at a scale that never existed before. When you think about recent investigative journalism projects, you're often talking about people looking through hundreds of thousands of documents. One thing AI tools and techniques can do is help journalists look for patterns and find stories in these larger collections of data.\nToday, natural language processing is used to find aberrations in data, and that can be the basis or a starting point for a story. What I anticipate moving forward is that reporters will have AI tools that will assess live trends. Instead of a journalist working to gather a lot of disparate information and sort through it, reporters will, eventually, be able to train a system to watch certain trends and notify them when something unusual happens.", "AI and its Impact on the Future of Journalism\nThe journalism industry is one rife for transformation, but for that to happen, it needs innovative engineers who can leverage the power of artificial intelligence.\nBy Jeremy Gilbert, Knight chair in digital media strategy at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications\nI cannot think of another time in the last 40 years when journalism felt as important as it does now. There are countless challenges and opportunities facing society that journalists can and should be prepared to communicate with the general public, but in many cases, that will not be possible without artificial intelligence (AI).", "3. The structure and substance of stories needs to be reimaginedA reporter's job requires a combination of different things. They go out and find information, they ask questions, they observe, and they identify existing trends in data. They write a story or record one to audio or video, and once it's done they consider additional ways to distribute it, like with a tweet or post on Facebook. Moving forward, that's not going to be enough. Reporters need to start considering how to craft different forms of that story, and for that, they'll need automated assistance.", "For example, say you've been keeping up-to-date on the American Jobs Plan as it moves through Congress. We should be able to use AI to tell you what happened today related to the plan, and how it might be relevant to you and your community. Or, conversely, if you haven't been following the status of the plan, we should be able to tell you not only what happened today, but also provide the background and context needed to help you understand the significance. We can help create empathy around major issues by not abstractedly referring to groups that might be impacted by this legislation, but by concretely mentioning things you know about. That kind of personalization is only possible at scale through automation.", "The most complicated of the three will be reframing what a story looks like. As we get systems that understand in a more human-like way the kinds of news that we have, then it will become possible to ask some of the more interesting questions people might ask. Then we can tell stories that are both a traditional read and a virtual dialogue. This will take time, and it's important to remember that smart speakers are still in their infancy, and creating content for them is even more recent. The reality, though, is that we have a generation of potential news consumers growing up who will be expecting to control a lot of different things with their voice. That will force storytellers \u2014 and journalists in particular \u2014 to rethink what it is they offer and how they offer it to consumers.", "These are interesting challenges facing not just the journalism industry, but society as a whole. There are a handful of data scientists and developers who went to major newsrooms in the past decade and did some incredible work, and I have every reason to believe that if we increase the number of talented AI-oriented developers and engineers in newsrooms, we will see even more improvements.

It\u2019s also understandable.

If not exactly nice to think about, they\u2019re still less grim than the situation immediately in front of newsrooms in 2023. Also absent is the public \u2014 the readership, the people who will be theoretically served or pleased or compelled to action by journalism in the coming years. How much automation do they want in their journalism? How much do they think they want? How much do they want to want? People consume news and engage with news organizations for all sorts of reasons, some more conscious than others: boredom; a sense of responsibility; ideological commitments; hope; fear; vindictiveness; feeling smart; getting mad. The success of the Times can surely be credited in part to its incomparable package of quality news content, but it can\u2019t be fully understood without, basically, a sociological analysis of American liberals and their consumption habits", ". Could ChatGPT come up with a plausible Thomas Friedman column? Absolutely. Would his many fans want to read it, and pay for it, knowing that its carefully mixed metaphors were generated by a piece of software trained on his archives? I sincerely doubt it!

Simple summarization isn\u2019t glamorous, but it\u2019s useful and accounts for a lot of what the news-consuming public actually reads.\nInevitable attempts to automate the rest, however, are likely to collide with the fundamental messiness of journalism as a concept and as a practice \u2014 that is, the publication and contested contextualization of information that isn\u2019t already out there on the internet waiting to be rolled into a training set or automatically synthesized into an aggregated stub of news. This collision is not an easy scenario to predict or control. An underrated risk is that publishers kill themselves trying.", "Another issue with this strategy is that it pits small publishers using tech companies\u2019 tools against the big tech companies themselves.

The tasks for which it seems most competent \u2014 providing some quick background on a broad subject, news event, or concept; suggesting products or content; reciting objectivish facts about a person or thing \u2014 are the ones that make it seem the most like a plagiarism machine. It\u2019s better than I expected it to be in a narrow sense. But it\u2019s also been surprising in a psychological and behavioral sense in that Google\u2019s credible, relevant-seeming AI content has become, at least to this user, something like an ad: a second-tier block of content over which my eyes are learning to skim", "When Manjoo describes using generative tools as like \u201cwearing a jet-pack,\u201d he\u2019s describing the process of using them on his own terms in a professional context where most other people \u2014 managers, co-workers, peers \u2014 don\u2019t.

Early-adopter office workers in various industries have been sharing similar experiences since ChatGPT came out about how the ability to outsource rote email writing or basic programming tasks has freed up time or energy.

What has become of the news industry in this scenario? Are news organizations still producing content for people to read and just allowing voracious tech companies to ingest and learn from it as well?

Google\u2019s \u201cGenesis\u201d story-generation tool represents a fuller expression of this approach. As a piece of software that will attempt to synthesize chosen and at least theoretically novel information into a newslike form, it promises to replace or streamline an important step in the production of stories.

The news media\u2019s flailing early responses to AI are, in their own ways, predictions. There are, so far, a few dominant schools of thought about this.\nTheory 1: AI replaces journalism", "In early July, the Associated Press made a deal with OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, to license \u201cpart of AP\u2019s text archive\u201d and get access to \u201cOpenAI\u2019s technology and product expertise.\u201d A few days later, OpenAI announced a $5 million grant, accompanied by $5 million in software use \u201ccredits,\u201d to the American Journalism Project, an organization that supports nonprofit newsrooms. Meanwhile, Google has reportedly been presenting major news organizations, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, with a new software \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d for journalists, code-named Genesis, which promises to \u201ctake in information \u2014 details of current events, for example \u2014 and generate news content,\u201d with a pitch described by some in attendance as unsettling", "Much more common, so far, are tentative plans to figure out how text-generation tools might be useful in human-centric news production and distribution. In April, Insider editor Nicholas Carlson gave his newsroom permission, or direction, to use tools like ChatGPT. \u201cMy takeaway after a fair amount of experimentation with ChatGPT is that generative AI can make all of you better editors, reporters, and producers, too,\u201d he wrote in a memo to staff, at the same time cautioning that such tools can provide incorrect information and effectively plagiarize. \u201cWe know it can help you solve writing problems. But your stories must be completely written by you,\u201d he wrote, leaving staffers with either a number of follow-up questions or perhaps just a bit of leeway. (In an interview with Axios, he framed generative AI as a tsunami: \u201cWe can either ride it or get wiped out by it", "An optimistic theory about tools like this is that they\u2019ll simply make certain journalistic operations more productive, partially automating friction-filled processes \u2014 typing, transcription, maybe even puzzling over structure \u2014 and freeing up resources to pursue, say, actual reporting. A great deal of what news organizations publish, including the incremental revelations of new or rare information most commonly associated with \u201cthe news,\u201d is presented in fairly standardized forms and styles, the thinking goes. The news is made novel, and valuable, by what it reveals, not the particular style of its revelation or distribution.", "The theoretical fully automated G/O blog doesn\u2019t win, in other words. More likely, it faces relegation, in the eyes of digital platforms, to the status of spam. It\u2019s unlikely that any existing news organization will end up exploring such a possibility to its full expression despite its superficial appeal to management. If it did, it \u2014 or at least we \u2014 would face a final problem: a fully automated news product, produced by incurious synthesis machines, based on already available information, and without a shred of oppositional agency, would amount to, at best, low-value aggregation, and, at worst, something like advertising. Or propaganda! It would be automating the parts of \u201cthe news\u201d that are already cheap.\nTheory 2: AI improves journalism", ". The media industry\u2019s particular expressions of panic are a result of a comprehensive sense of exposure to these new forms of automation \u2014 which is arguably the best way to think about artificial intelligence \u2014 combined with a sense of profound confusion about what the challenges are and for whom.", "An outcome along these lines \u2014 news organizations becoming training assistants and data providers for AI giants \u2014 seems, despite or maybe because of the big ask up front, to anticipate total domination by tech companies and the obliteration of the media as a distinct industry. Media owners seem to be trying for a sort of fantasy do-over of the social-media era, where, sure, their businesses still get marginalized, but at least they get paid. Understood as a legal gambit, it might overestimate news organizations\u2019 value to companies that are selling all-purpose text generation and have plenty of other material to draw from. If one possible objective is an end to unauthorized story scraping, well, great, but chances are Google, which is probably the most advanced web-crawling operation in the world, will find a way to get what it needs to spit out competent search blurbs.", ". I bring this up not to make a prediction about the limits of AI-generated mass-media content but instead to emphasize the hopelessness of competing with it as a traditional publication that hopes to harvest search traffic with definitionally worse and less-relevant AI-generated mass-media content. Again, the answers to the most obvious question \u2014 what sorts of content can a machine generate while maintaining the interest of human readers \u2014become irrelevant.", "This would turn news organizations into diminished wire services without the need to actually write whole stories for distribution \u2014 they would just be filling in blanks for some yet-to-be-determined AI-powered news-production apparatus. Functionally, it would also make them a bit like the web scrapers AI firms already use to build their training sets and their reporters\u2019 jobs a bit more like those of the armies of contractors whom AI companies already rely on to keep their products working.", "This school of thought places tools like ChatGPT on a spectrum with earlier forms of automation in and around the news business, from word processors and spell-checkers to internet publishing and social media; it also takes an idealistic view of journalism and its function in the world. It addresses concerns about accuracy, bias, and plagiarism by emphasizing the final role of the human writer, who becomes, I guess, a sort of editor, or auditor, for content produced not by but with the help of AI tools.", "In journalism, however, it seems like an early fight over leverage and AI might unfold between news organizations and tech companies \u2014 between owners and owners \u2014 in the form of lawsuits and content-sharing deals. Semafor\u2019s reporting suggesting that a consortium of news organizations want billions of dollars in compensation from AI firms implies some interesting predictions on its part. Let\u2019s say the consortium gets it \u2014 a legal question without clear precedent \u2014 and Google and Microsoft-funded OpenAI end up paying hefty fees to use news organizations\u2019 content for training or as the source of fresh information to keep their products current", ". But why not \u2026 decreased staffing levels? Higher expectations for total volume of content produced? In a moment where many newsrooms are suffering crises of distribution and revenue \u2014 problems for which generative AI offers no obvious help \u2014 the most obvious use for any form of automation is cost reduction.", "This optimism depends on a few different assumptions. One is that ChatGPT-esque tools will prove genuinely useful to reporters in the long term, providing meaningful help to people working to report, contextualize, and analyze new information about the world \u2014 an assumption that seems to be, at this point, helped along by brief experiences testing out ChatGPT and an unfortunate susceptibility to narratives of inevitable tech. Another is that, in the actual workplaces in which journalism is produced, the time and resources freed up by easier content production would be automatically reallocated to, say, accountability journalism, in-the-field reporting, or whatever else news executives like to say they want more of", "It\u2019s tempting to get stuck on the question of whether AI tools are (or soon will be) capable of producing plausible versions of much of the content already published by these publications. As a strategy, however, the all-in-on-AI approach renders that question irrelevant. If a bot can\u2019t convincingly mass-produce content people want to read, or at least content against which views can be somehow harvested by publishers for ads, then the plan fails. If it can \u2014 that is, if G/O can replace a bunch of its content with AI-generated topical blog posts and retain some sort of profitable readership \u2014 then it would seem the plan still fails, because if G/O can, then anyone can and will. The cost of a skimmed-and-discarded blog post will approach zero and, like other forms of content that have already been substantially automated (quarterly-earnings summaries, weather reports, basic sports results), will cease to produce much value on its own."], "title": "How Will Artificial Intelligence Change Journalism? - New York Magazine"}, "https://journalistsresource.org/home/generative-ai-policies-newsrooms/": {"url": "https://journalistsresource.org/home/generative-ai-policies-newsrooms/", "description": "The analysis provides a snapshot of the current state of AI policies and documents for 52 news organizations, including newsrooms in Brazil, India, North America, Scandinavia and Western Europe.

Buzzfeed and Reach PLC, for example, both recently shared plans to explore the potential of AI-generated content \u2013 the former while cutting 12% of its workforce and the latter while streamlining by about 4%.\nWith ChatGPT drafting essays, speeches, and even computer code in seconds, and Midjourney and DALL-E 2 creating images of almost anything imaginable, it would be easy to worry that the proliferation of \u2013 and budding reliance on \u2013 AI might make journalism as we know it redundant.\nBut AI\u2019s legal and ethical ramifications, which span intellectual property (IP) ownership and infringement issues, content verification and moderation concerns and the potential to break existing newsroom funding models, leave its future relationship with journalism far from clear-cut.", "By contrast, independent press regulator Impress recently updated its Standard Code pertaining to AI-generated content. Soon after technology site CNET allowed AI to write articles, only to inadvertently and repeatedly publish false information, Impress asked publishers to \u201cbe aware of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology to create and circulate false content (for example, deepfakes), and exercise human editorial oversight to reduce the risk of publishing such content\u201d.\n[Read more: \u2018You do not automate people out of their jobs\u2019: Data journalism bosses on the rise of robots]\nThe future of journalism\nA double-edged sword, AI may see newsrooms cut down on human authors to save costs \u2013 even as it disrupts a decades-old revenue model rooted in digital advertising.", "[Read more: How news publishers can use AI tech like ChatGPT without upsetting Google]\nWho owns AI-generated articles?\nIf newsrooms take the plunge and incorporate AI-generated content, the chief question is: who owns the IP and associated distribution rights (key for newswires)? The outlet instructing the AI platform or the AI platform itself?\nUnlike the in the US, UK legislation does provide copyright protection to computer-generated works \u2013 although only a human author or corporate persona can \u201cown\u201d the IP (never the AI itself).\nBroadly, this means that where an AI platform requires minimal contribution other than basic user prompts, and automated decision-making drives the creative process, the platform creator would likely be deemed the \u201cauthor\u201d and IP owner in the first instance. Conversely, when more significant input is needed (e.g. via uploaded materials), and the AI is a supporting tool, IP in the output might fall to the human user.", "However, whether this means that AI will \u201csteal\u201d journalists\u2019 jobs is questionable. Buzzfeed themselves stated that human-generated content would remain at the core of its newsroom, deploying AI for tailored content such as its famous quizzes and listicles.\nCapitalising on AI innovation in journalism\nThe relationship between AI and journalism may be in the spotlight \u2013 but it isn\u2019t new and it\u2019s not all bad. Outlets such as Forbes have leveraged AI for years, creating automated and simple reports. In an era of relentless content, where outlets fight for speed and cut-through, AI-informed headlines and summaries can make research and writing more efficient for time-pressured journalists.", "In January 2023, ChatGPT acknowledged its own weakness, telling fact-checking firm Newsguard: \u201cBad actors could weaponize me by fine-tuning my model with their own data, which could include false or misleading information.\u201d Ironically, this was an accurate claim, given that when the researchers put 100 prompts into ChatGPT involving false narratives, it provided misleading statements in 80% of responses.\nFurthermore, while excellent at capturing data, AI lacks a real-life journalist\u2019s social nuance and ability to interact with human case-studies. Unable to navigate sensitivities and capable of misinformation, AI-generated content could, without human moderation, fall short of the editorial standards demanded by IPSO and Ofcom (and whether either has sufficient regulation in place to address AI is another question, although, under the Online Safety Bill, the latter eventually plans to).", "In practice, journalists engaging AI must check the platform T&Cs to assess the contractual terms on which IP in the output is provided. Some will \u201cassign\u201d IP to the user on creation. Others may retain the IP and provide it under a \u201clicence\u201d (which may come with restrictive terms on how newsrooms can deploy material).\n[Read more: FT creates AI editor role to lead coverage on new tech]\nThe risks of AI publication\nIrrespective of who owns the underlying copyright, newsrooms must be prepared to face liability for any AI-generated content they publish \u2013 including with respect to defamation and misinformation. While many AI tools do not so far \u201cpublish\u201d their responses to anyone but the user (and small-scale publication is unlikely to cause liability for the tool itself), anyone employing these technologies will be held responsible for content they make available.", "Publishers and search engines rely on users giving their attention to advertisements. Until now, the model has worked by way of users typing questions into a search engine (which derives ad revenue by promoting sponsored links) before being directed to third-party websites for answers (which in turn derive ad revenue via third-party ads). But if ChatGPT has already trawled the internet, read relevant links, and packaged the answer in a concise paragraph, perhaps users no longer need to browse the internet at all?\nThis will likely result in a paradigm shift in the relationship between publishers, advertisers and search engines as browser behaviours evolve in line with new technologies. New funding models may emerge, and we are yet to see how powerful AI chatbot tools might integrate affiliate links and third-party ads.", "But even with the rise of more sophisticated automated content, it seems unlikely that newsrooms will rely on AI alone to create articles. Established and respected media brand names, earned through decades of painstaking research and careful and balanced reporting, will be loath to have their credibility and reporting ingenuity challenged.\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s fair to assume that AI will test whether existing regulation around IP authorship, content verification and moderation, and newsroom operating and funding norms are fit for the modern age. While there will always be a place for the journalist, so too do we stand on the precipice of a new era in which AI is here to stay.\nEmail pged@pressgazette.co.uk to point out mistakes, provide story tips or send in a letter for publication on our \"Letters Page\" blog"], "title": "ChatGPT, AI and journalism: Legal and ethical pitfalls explained"}, "https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-guidelines-ap-news-532b417395df6a9e2aed57fd63ad416a": {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-guidelines-ap-news-532b417395df6a9e2aed57fd63ad416a", "description": "FILE - The Associated Press logo is shown at the entrance to the news organization\u2019s office in New York on Thursday, July 13, 2023.
